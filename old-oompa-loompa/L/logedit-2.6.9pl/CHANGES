This file documents changes to the logedit program.

v3.0 (planned one day)
- Interactive interface using curses/cursesX, for people who don't
  like the command line.

v2.6.9pl
- Running logedit without any arguments produces the syntax display, unless
  it's in a pipe.
- The inst.sh script tries to find perl5 if it can

v2.6.8pl
- Fixed a bug with the -m (strip @mail) option

v2.6.7pl
- Using -y and -g together works better now. Fixes a bug reported by
  Frederick Hicks.
- Stripped lines are no longer considered to be the last line that logedit
  saw, when deciding if there's spam or for the purposes of grouping.
  Fixes a bug reported by Frederick Hicks.

v2.6.6pl
- Better behavior when you don't have a .logeditrc
- Prompting if -b will overwrite an existing file
- A sample .logeditrc is again included
- The existence of the GNU copyleft is made more prominent

v2.6.5pl
Logedit now behaves under perl 5.0 
Fixes to bugs reported by Lorrie Wood and David Johnson:
- The -T switch now behaves as in the man page, removing idle/haven/away
  messages from or to you
- Word-wrap settings now mentioned in log header
- Logedit now behaves better when re-editing a logedit'd log 
- Fixed bug when using -q and -y together
- Ctrl-C will now interrupt the logedit help listing at the prompt
- Fixed a bug in handling of #log
- When using -n, log header doesn't report a config file

v2.6.1pl (in-house)
Suggested by David Johnson (Willem@Dune):
- The -N switch works right now.
- The -g switch is now documented in the man page
- The -M switch now removes the puppet notification message (Puppet>),
  while keeping the puppet's view in the log.

v2.6pl
- Logedit rewritten in perl, which results in greater portability, more
  consistent and powerful regexp parsing, and usually greater speed and
  a smaller executable.
- New, more descriptive config file format, modelled after elmrc.
  New -b switch to auto-build a config file from an existing config
  file and/or command-line parameters.
- New -k <regexp> switch - lines matching the regexp are *kept* in the
  log, even if they'd normally be stripped. (Chani's idea)
- The -O (O-spam) switch handle pronoun changes now, and works better.
- New -v (verbose) switch lets you hear what logedit is doing.
- The -% switch has been renamed -C (Client message removal)
- The -: switch has been renamed -R (Raw telnet mode)
- Nospoof-marked lines are optionally removed with -N. Or, you could
  just have the nospoof markers themselves removed, but the line itself
  remain with -S (Spoof mode)
- Bourne shell & perl installation scripts included.
- The -i switch uses stdin for input. Same as a filename of '-'.

v2.5.5c - The Amberyl Revision :) (in-house)
- Curses stuff fixed a bit, thanks to Amberyl.
- TINYMUSH and PENN150 no longer compile-time defines
  Instead, the -1 (penn) and -2 (tiny) switches handle it, though you
  can change the default (no switch specified) behavior from PennMUSH 
  to TinyMUSH with an #define in logedit.h
- Fixes to some of the TINYMUSH parameters. Suggested by Amberyl.
- Removal of puppet stuff (-P), or grouping of it (-g).
- Removal of NOSPOOF stuff now optional (-N)
- GNU configure script included

v2.5
- Can now use logedit as a pipe from stdin with the - filename.
- The -i switch is now -I. The -o switch is now -O. In preparation
  for major changes in version 3.0.
- Can now specify the output file, or stdout. (-o)
- Can now quickly remove anything that's not a player acting, using
  a single switch (-q).

v2.4 - The Chani Revision :)
- Running logedit without arguments gives a screen-paged display of
  switches and settings, using a curses library, if desired, and
  ugly cooked i/o if not. The help switches (-?, -h, -H) provide
  a non-paged version for redirection or what have you.
- Can now strip lines starting with : and ", for non-tf'ers. (-:)
- -W switch now takes a space between it and argument
- Can now remove time-stamped messages (@idle, @away, @haven) (-T)
  (Suggested by Chani@Dune)
- Word wrapping/You-conversion interaction improved. (Bug reported by
  Chani@Dune)
- Major restructuring of how switches are handled internally.

v2.3
- Logedit can wrap lines and indent the resulting paragraphs with some
  flexibility. (-W)

v2.2
- Logedit can now strip out or only include given tf worlds (-f)
- MUSH @mail reading can automatically by removed. (-m)
- Logedit can optionally remove ANSI codes from logs. (-A)
- The switches now toggle config file settings. I.e., if it's set on
  in the config file, the switch turns it off. 
- The configuration file can be specified on the command line (-F)
- A man page (logedit.1) is now included, instead of the earlier logedit.info
  file. A separate INSTALL file is also included, as well as a Makefile.
- A sample config file is included (sample.logeditrc)
- The code is indented in the GNU style.

v2.1.2 (in-house)

- Logedit now automatically removes ANSI codes from logs. This will
  probably become an option.
- Fixed a bug in the aggressive o-succ removal for lines with 1 word.
- The syntax display (logedit or logedit -h/?) now indicates the status
  of the switches based on their setting in the config file, if any

v2.1.1

- Larry Shields pointed out a code typo in add_name_tree. Fixed.

v2.1

- The TINYMUSH define now works, so TinyMUSH 2.0 users can use logedit
- Christian Scarborough add the -i switch, which double-spaces logs.
- Christian Scarborough added the SUNOS define, for compiling logedit
  with gcc under SUNOS

v2.0 (first public release)
- Major revisions, lots more switches and options, use of regexps and
  .logeditrc file.

Detailed revision information for versions before 2.0 doesn't exist.
I don't remember. :)
