.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBlogedit\fR program is a tool designed to help players and admins
of role-playing MUSHes trim down logs of role-playing events on the
MUSH. It takes a log file (indicated by 'filename' or from stdin) and
produces as output another file (by default 'filename.log') after
optionally removing a number of typical things which are annoying in
logs.
.nf

	Logedit *always* strips the following things from logs:
	\- Messages beginning with GAME: or MAIL:
	\- Nospoof []'s
	\- * has connected, disconnected, or reconnected messages
	\- Huh? (Type help for help)
	\- Flag set. and Doing set.
	\- Any line appearing twice in succession (simple SPAM)
	\- Anything between a pair of '#log' lines. This allows you, while
	  logging, to 'think #log', thus indicating that what follows
	  (until you 'think #log' again) is to be stripped by logedit.

.SH OPTIONS
.LP
These options control what is to be stripped from the log:
.TP
\fB\-a\fR
Remove @wall/@rwall/@wizwall messages
.TP
\fB\-c\fR
Remove @chat messages from all channels
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
Remove DOING/WHO lists
.TP
\fB\-f\fR [-]world
This option supports tinyfugue logging. -f world will put \fBonly\fR
output from "world" into the log; -f -world will skip output from "world"
when making the log. You can specify either multiple worlds to include,
or multiple -worlds to skip, each with its own -f switch. If only one
world is specified to include, tf's ---- World <name> ---- messages will
not be printed. If more than one world is specified to include, the 
messages will be printed. (If you wanna be sure they're not there,
use a regexp like "^---- World .* ----$" in your .logeditrc.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR
Remove * has arrived and * has left messages
.TP
\fB\-m\fR
Remove @mail messages read while logging
.TP
\fB\-p\fR
Remove pages to you and from you
.TP
\fB\-q\fR
Quick-edit. Removes all lines except those which start with a player's
name (thus, usually leaving you only player actions.) This switch 
implies others, as it also auto-removes all pages, whispers, leave/arrive
messages, admin and broadcast messages, channels, and WHO/DOINGs.
It's a very good idea
to use the -y <name> switch with this option, as well, particularly
for short logs. This switch is often used with -n, since it tends to
stand alone, though you could probably combine it just fine with your
.logeditrc.
.TP
\fB-r\fR <regexp>
Remove the regular expression (as per ex, grep, etc)
which follows the switch. You can have multiple
regexps, but each needs its own switch, e.g.
\fBlogedit\fR -r foo -r "[Bb]ar\\." myfile
.TP
\fB-t\fR
Terse mode: room descriptions are removed, and contents lists
are shoved onto a single line. This mode requires that the log
be taken by someone who can see db#s - usually an admin, a
see_all player (in PennMUSH), or possibly a mortal if the whole
log takes place in rooms they own.
.TP
\fB-w\fR
Remove whispers to you and from you
.TP
\fB-x\fR <name>
Remove anything by <name>. Like -r, you can stack these,
but you must use multiple -x's, too, e.g.
\fBlogedit\fR -apw -x Paul -x Javelin myfile
.TP
\fB\-A\fR
Remove any ANSI codes in the from the log.
.TP
\fB\-O\fR
Remove "o-spam", the messages you get when 20 players all leave
a room, one after the other, giving you 20 osucc/odrop messages.
Essentially removes any consecutive lines in which everything
but the first word (a player's name) matches.
.TP
\fB\-:\fR
Remove any lines starting with : or " characters.
Useful for people stuck logging from telnet.
.TP
\fB\-%\fR
Remove any lines starting with % characters. These are usually
messages from tinyfugue telling you about activity in other worlds
or whatever.
.LP
These options modify the output in useful ways:
.TP
\fB-s\fR
Include statistics at the end of the log. These statistics
include line and word counts on the original and new files
(so you can see how much you trimmed), a list of all
players who spoke or acted during the event (with numbers for
how often they spoke (VERBOSITY) or acted (ACTION) - speaking
counts as an action), and players who appear to have been
on-line or present, but said nothing.
.TP
\fB-y\fR <name>
Convert 'You say,' to '<name> says,' to give the log
a third-person view.
.TP
\fB-I\fR
Insert blank lines between log lines. This improves readability
of the log significantly, at the cost of making it longer to
print, etc. Room descs, contents lists, etc, are kept together.
This switch added by Christian Scarborough.
.TP
\fB-W \fR[<col>[,<first>[,<rest>]]]
Word wrap long lines, resulting in no line longer than <col> characters.
For each word-wrapped paragraph, indent the first line <first> spaces,
and all other lines <rest> spaces. Any of the parameters can be
left out: if no <col> is specified, 72 is assumed. <first> and <rest>
default to 0.
Word wrap will, of course, fail
miserably if you have words longer than <col> characters. 
There must be a space between -W and the numbers.
.LP
Finally, these options control the use of the configuration file,
input and output files, or provide program help:
.TP
\fB-n\fR
Ignore the settings in the configuration file (.logeditrc by default)
Command-line switches always take precedence over configuration
file settings, and work like toggles, i.e., if statistics are set on
in the configuration file, logedit -s will turn them off. Use the -n
switch in situations where there might be multiple configuration files.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR [filename]
Use "filename" as the output file for the editted log, instead of
the default <inputfile>.log. If "filename" is omitted, the output
is sent to stdout.
.TP
\fB\-F\fR filename
Use "filename" as the configuration file, in place of ~/.logeditrc.
.TP
\fB\-h, -H, -?\fR
Show help. The help display lists all logedit switches, and their
values as defined in the configuration file. 
Because this display is longer than many screens, running logedit without
arguments provides a paged version of the same display.
.TP
\fB\-\fR
If "-" is used as the last item on the command line in place of an 
input filename, logedit will read from the stdin, and write to
the stdout, unless a different file is specified with -o.
This allows logedit to function as a filter in a pipe.
.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
\fBlogedit\fR joust
.LP
\fBlogedit\fR -o joust.log joust
.LP
\fBlogedit\fR -o joust.log - < joust
.LP
\fBlogedit\fR - < joust > joust.log
.LP
cat joust.log | \fBlogedit\fR - > joust.log
.LP
Trim the file joust using the default settings in .logeditrc,
and write the result to joust.log. All five commands will produce
the same result, and the last three illustrate the use of logedit
as a filter for stdin and stdout.
.LP
\fBlogedit\fR -n -aw -x John -r OOC -y Javelin joust
.LP
Trim the file joust, ignoring .logeditrc, skipping any actions by John
and any lines containing the string "OOC", converting "You say" to
"Javelin says", and write the result to joust.log
.LP
\fBlogedit\fR -n -q -y Javelin -o joust.stripped joust
.LP
Quick-trim the file joust, ignoring .logeditrc, converting "You say" to
"Javelin says" and writing the output to joust.stripped. The output
will contain only lines with player actions.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
.LP
The configuration file (.logeditrc by default) is used to store
your most common settings and preferences for logedit. It may contain
any number of lines, but each line must be one of the following types:
.TP
#
Lines beginning with '#' are comments.
.TP
switches=<switches>
Specifies switches to use. The list should be just like the
command-line form, but with no '-' character, e.g.
switches=apw 
You may not use the -f, -o, -r, -x, -y, or -W switches in this way.
Instead:
.TP
remove=<regexp>
Specifies a unix regular expression to strip from all logs.
Any line containing the expression will be removed.
This is equivalent to the -r command-line switch.
Use one remove line per regexp.
For more information about regexps, see the man pages for
ex, sed, or grep.
.TP
exclude=<name>
Specifies the name of a player to exclude (gag) in the log.
All lines starting with the <name> are removed.
Use a separate exclude line for each name.
.TP
world=<name>
Specifies a single tinyfugue world from which output is to be kept.
Output from all other worlds is skipped. Takes precedence over
-world lines.
.TP
-world=<name>
Specifies a tinyfugue world from which output is to be skipped.
You can have multiple -world lines, one for each world to skip.
.TP
wrap=<col>[,<first>[,<rest>]]
Specifies how to wrap long lines. The column at which to wrap
is given by <col>, and is required. The optional parameters
<first> and <rest> set the number of spaces to indent the first
line in the wrapped paragraph and the rest of the lines, respectively,
and default to 0. To indicate a <rest> and no <first> (for hanging
indentation), either wrap=<col>,0,<rest> or wrap=<col>,,<rest>
is acceptable.
.TP
you=<name>
Specifies how you would like "You" in "You say," to be translated.
.LP
Logedit will report any other kind of line as an warning, to aid
in the proper creation of the configuration file, but will go ahead
and process the log anyway.
.LP
The -n command-line switch causes \fBlogedit\fR to ignore the configuration
file, should you wish to override it on occasion.
.SH BUGS
.LP
There may be some discrepancies in the handling of spoofed emits.
Because some MUSHes (notably the one I run) use []'s for MUSH-coded
chat channels, the whole removal of nospoof stuff is a question I've
been reconsidering. Anyway, the use of the -q flag may make spoofed
emits get handled differently than normal.
.LP
When editing multi-world logs using the -f switch, logedit assumes that
any text before the first world change should be preserved in the log.
