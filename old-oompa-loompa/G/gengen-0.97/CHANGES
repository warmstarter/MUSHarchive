This file documents changes in gengen.

Version 0.97
* "Whitespace" really means one or more, not two or more, now
* Can now generate rooms that have no attribs or code in them

Version 0.96 (unreleased)
* Clarification in the man page.

Version 0.95
* The /sheet command is now created after we know the command prefix,
  so it matches.
* @wait me was left out of all the attribute-setting commands, so the
  semaphore got progressively more negative all the time.

Version 0.94
* Fixes a bug in the topology=spokes specification

Version 0.93
* Fixes a bug in the spend spec.

Version 0.92
* Added two styles of chargen room topology: linear (the original style)
  and spokes. Suggested by Maestro@M*U*S*H
* Cleaned up some issues with leading/trailing spaces
* We now require quickbuild 1.06 because we produce zone master rooms
  if using the spokes topology.

Version 0.91
* Immediate minor bugfix.

Version 0.90
* Initial gengen release
