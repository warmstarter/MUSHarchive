gengen is a perl script that lets you quickly create a character generation
area for a MUSH by specifying the attributes of your characters and
how they should be generated in an easy-to-use format. It converts
this file into a quickbuild input file which can be converted
into uploadable MUSH code.

gengen is written in Perl and requires Perl version 5 and quickbuild 1.06
or later (see INSTALL for details).  It is copyrighted by Alan Schwartz
and distributed under the GNU public license.

The latest version of gengen (and quickbuild) is available at:
