I've just modified $room:@exits so that it will give a list of exits for
everyone. It will list -all- exits if it's called by a wizard or by the owner
of the room in question; it will only list obvious exits for everyone else.
I hope this will help people find exits when they're wandering around.
To use this command, in a room, just type: @exits

I like having it on a feature object but it needs some docs.
What would also be nice is a simple look-up verb that would allow another verb
to call it with a player-num and string so we can find out what a player means
when they say "alley" or something like that.

I have written a version of the LambdaMOO ' page verb. For those who don't know
it, it's an abbreviated form of paging, so you can use a syntax like:
  'Briar I think you're a sucky wizard!
and it will be executed the same as if you had typed
  page Briar with I think you're a sucky wizard!
for your convenience.

From:     Blackbriar (#110)
To:       *Theme-Issues (#120)
Subject:  My Thoughts on Silly Player Classes

I'm writing this as Blackbriar and not as Briar for a reason. These are ONLY my
personal opinions, and I'm only stating them to provoke discussion. I am NOT
writing as the ArchWizard because as a Wizard I have no opinion here (I'll
support any building people choose to do).

There's been some talk about making a player class with [1] login watcher, [2]
selective ability to be moved, [3] class ``shouting'', [4] ``pals listing'' and
the like. I just wanna address these in turn because I think this is a terribly
dumb idea.

LOGIN WATCHER.
The login watcher is -not- a player class feature. If people want it, there's
two ways to implement it: as a feature object running with a forked task, or I
could hack it into $player. I have no objection to doing this, and I have been
considering doing this. If it were hacked into $player:confunc and
$player:disfunc, it'd be terribly easy to write a few verbs which handle [a]
whether you're listening, and [b] if there's anyone special you care about.
This is an area in which I, as a Wizard, would be more than happy to step in.
I've been considering sticking a player class benweet $player and $builder
which contains only OpalMOO-specific stuff.

SELECTIVE ABILITY TO BE MOVED.
Now, this is a grungy, scummy place, OpalMOO is, and there's gonna be thugs and
gunfights and there's gonna be puzzles and all games like that. Some of these
games will depend on moving the player around, and I would -really- rather use
player:moveto() than a wizardly move().
If things ever get to the point that there's @move fights on OpalMOO, I think
we can safely agree to reconsider this, but I think that if we start being
paranoid about moving at this early stage we're just going to hinder us when we
stop building and start programming.

CLASS SHOUTING.
This isn't LambdaMOO. We have no rules against shouting, if there's something
to be said. I don't like the idea of class-ish shouting and I never have
because it promotes cliques. We're small here; we don't NEED cliques. If
there's a good reason why there should be class-only shout, I'd love to hear
it.
I'd be willing to move $wiz:@shout down to $prog if there's a desire. If it
gets abused, we can move it back.

PALS LISTING:
I look at OpalMOO and I see forty-four players. Subtract eight Guests and two
Wizardly second characters and we're got thirty-four players. This is a small
MOO, and it's growing fairly slowly because we're not advertising (because,
heh, we aren't entirely legit).
If we want to implement the 'who do I care about logging on' thing mentioned
above, then by all means I'll implement that. But this `pals' stuff... I dunno,
it also grates on me same as before, with the cliquish nonsense I had so hoped
to avoid here on OpalMOO.

I know I'm an old stick-in-the-mud, but I had hoped that if people were gonna
bring things over from LambdaMOO they would bring utilities, generics...
helpful stuff. I had really hoped to avoid bringing over cliquish crap. Just my
personal feelings.

Any comments?
Blackbriar (as an individual).

I agree. If we can avoid getting too tons of player classes we don't need, it
will make everything a LOT easier to deal with buth socially and
programming-wise. Besides, there are very few things you can put on a player
class that you couldn't do with regular objects.

Although, I would like to see a few addition to player (carried_msg

Actually, I am working on integration for OpalMOO. Both rooms and players will
integrate... it'll appear the same way to the casual user (carried_msg for
personal integration and look_msg for rooms) but I'm going to build it myself
instead of porting stuff over.

If you check your parentage, you'll see the OpalMOO Player Class (#240) which
will have all OpalMOO-specific hacking (well, most, if not all). There will
also be an OpalMOO Room which will handle the integration thang.

This all comes, though, when I have the time to do it right.

Now I don't want to go and credit this to myself, but I feel that I, at least
in part caused all this player class babble, by bringing it up with Briar.
My defense here is this:
I support several of the Schmoo (oops, i said a forbidden word) not because
of it being in a class, as i wasn't even around for the whole start of the
Schmoo affair, but because it has given me conveniences that are not
cliquish, but just conveniences.
Such as what?
Well, I do prefer the who it comes with especially the perk of having it
displayed when i log on and the two column format. I guess, both are features
dictated as convenience by a large system, but hey what's wrong with planning
ahead? I don't
believe it's cliquish, but rather that it helps in a crowded system. Hm, ie, i
should save this discussion until such time that we encounter a crowded system.
Same goes for pals, a crowded system feature and it should be noted that even
though I may get along with everyone, there are a couple of people that i
like to be notified of, perhaps for personal reasons. But again, a crowded
system kind of feature.
Well, do i have a point then?
Sure, I kinda miss the short form of paging and remote emoting, less for the
reduced typing but for the remebering of who was paged last and automatically
paging that person with the next page. Ideally, if we do stop teleportation
and switch to a walking based MOO, we might want to abolish paging as well and
go for telephones, viewscreens and the like (with busy lines) to facilitate
the touch and feel of this reality.
The last thing, once again a feature to be abolished with telepathy kind of
communication is the shout. When i mentioned the class shouting to briar, it
was not meant as a shout for the clique of people belonging to a class, but a
shout for everyone, except that each player could turn it off when he/she does
not want to listen.

All in all, i am for not having multiple player classes, but installing
everything as features. That way we don't get to the dilemma that you have to
belong to this group if you want this perk and you cannot have the perks of
those others, the lesser beings, since you are now one of us.
Here's a final feature inclusion request. Either allow for @exits to be
built in to see them anytime one walks into a room or maybe port the @rose
feature... Something similar, to facilitate the natural ability to notice
things around you... Or is that part of a self-integrating room?

That's my buck twenty-three worth....

Although I had a little trouble understanding the first half of FaithHealer's
post, I do have some response to the second half.

@Exits should not be displayed except to the owner of the room. If you want to
know the exits of a room not owned by you, you should use @ways. If we want to
implement optional listing of @ways at each move, we need to put it on the
player. Putting it on a Feature would only work if (a) there was a companion
verb on the player (:moveto() notification) or if (b) the Feature had an
expensive perpetually looping task that watched for player movement.

I think we should keep page permanently because it's handy for when you get
stuck somewhere you can't get out of and there's no other available means of
communication.

Shout might be better done as some sort of OO thing like walkie-talkies or
something. It would be simple to simply have the player :tell() announce to the
player contents. On Lambda, that could be a problem but on a small MOO, there
isn't much to get in the way.

That's exactly what I was gonna say. Sheesh. And let's step back a second and
remember that you can do a @who here and it will already be done before
Lambda's lag lets your @who start.
I don't care about other variants of WHO -- if someone wants to port over the
multi-column one, I'll put it on $opal_class. But none of this sexy-WHO crap.

My main objection to Schmoo-pals is that it's always been a terribly back-assed
way to do it. If one wants login notification, etc. of a group of people
there's the Login Watcher on LambdaMOO. Everyone knows about it, but they still
use bogus class features. Gr.

I have been working on ways to determine whose loging you get notified about. I
actually think it's working, but. Feel free to debug.
 @login [on|off] <- turns on/off login-watcher notification
 @interesting [player player player...] <- determines who you wanna know about.
Prefix a player's name with a ! to make it uninteresting.
If it doesn't work, I won't be surprised; send bugs to me.

We already have an abbreviated page and remote-emote.
  'briar You are a sucky wizard!
will be the same as if I had typed
  page briar with "You are a sucky wizard!"
And, similarly, I could try to make up for it with
  +briar gives you a lollipop.
We do NOT have respond yet, and we do NOT have any recollection of who you last
paged. This is because I am -writing- these as opposed to porting them over.
(Whiteboard? Heee.)

While I -personally- think that paging is terribly non-VR, I have to agree that
it's a fairly necessary evil. Perhaps I could hook paging into the room,
though, so the owner of a room could determine whether a percon may send or
receive pages in that room.
(I also like paging Opal, and since I'm the ArchWizard I'm keeping paging
around. Heh.)

If you want this, write it and I'll stick it on $opal_class (with you owning
it, of course, so you can hack it at will). I don't mind a general
plea-for-help kind of thing.

However, if paging is keyed into the room, then so will be this shout.

Groovetunes. This is exactly what I like, even though I'm building all sorts of
crap on $opal_class that should really be on features. Hey, it's -easier- as
classes.

I've given $room:@exits aliases of @ways and ways. It presently displays all
obvious exits to non-owners and all exits to owners. (This is the same
information contained obtained by the @rose feature, etc.) I am not happy with
the information it presently gives; I think it's too much to non-owners and it
was a quick hack. But until I change it, this information stands and is
available.
Opal and I discussed having exits integrate into the room. We decided that it
would be better not to have that, to leave it in the description to describe
where the exits were.

@exits and @ways and all the like do exist, and are available to all, but the
owner can handle non-obvious exits and hide them.
I really REALLY don't like having an automatic @ways at each move. But if it
were to be done, I'd put it on $room:enterfunc().

There is no fear of page going away. There -is- fear, though, of having it link
into rooms. I really like that idea.

There is nothing to stop me from having $opal_class:tell() filter everything
into the player's contents. If people write things that would make it useful,
that is. I'm not comfortable with it (and I would probably over-ride it on
myself) because I don't like the idea of objects within me listening...
Remember that $player:accept lets anything in except for another player.

Of course, someone could build a room with an :exitfunc() that moves the player
back to the room and a `page' verb on the room to override the $room page verb
so that the player couldn't call for help.  I think we should keep `page' on
the player.  Optionally, we could have the player's page verb check for certain
conditions in the room and use the room's system when available but have a
backup system on the player.

Well, it would be easy to set the player up to check if any message was
displayed in accordance with the entrance of an object similar to the way
#17755:paranoid_enterfunc() works on LambdaMOO.  Not that I'm saying we should
port that, just making an example.

I'm personally against having seated messages on the rooms and would much
prefer to use some sort of Seat Objects.  Of course, to make it really work,
you'd have to be able to hack the room's :tell_contents().
I'd be willing to accept this project if there's enough interest.

I have just completed the Generic Room Area (#343) and it's child the Generic
Sitting Area (#344).
Both are relatively simple. They have trick :title_msg() verbs to show who is
occupying them.  They also have :look_msg() verbs for whenever :look_msg()
integration gets implemented.
Both are fertile and ready for use. Please use freely.

Subject:  The Death Of Teleportation

I have put together the new $room:accept which will, I believe, eliminate
teleportation on OpalMOO. It will only allow one to enter a room under the
following circumstances:
 1. You own the room (or are wizardly).
 2. You enter the room through an exit.
 3. You are -returning- to the room from an editor.
 4. You live there (i.e. are in the room's .residents property).

I have not yet installed this, though; I want to think a bit more about it. To
look at the incoming code, and/or to make comments about the code, I offer for
your perusal #109:accept, with all due credit going to yduJ.

Some notes:
+ Room integration was nearly done before I recycled it since apparently we
already HAVE room integration here (funny, that).
+ I am not stupid enough to have put the integration messages on $root_class
without having considered what to do with them. I had, though, realized that
room integration is different from character integration which is different
from container integration. But, hey, what do -I- know?

I'm going to leave the wizzing to Opal for a time; I think I need to go back to
LambdaMOO and fix broken things.

Take care. See you as Blackbriar.

I'm not trying to supercede your position as a Wizard, Briar.  When I designed
my version of integration it was with the idea that you could look it over,
change it where you liked, maybe use some of the ideas in your design, or
ignore it if you liked your version better.  Really, I only built the thing
because I just really didn't have anything better to do.

I never said you were stupid.  If it sounded as if I were implying that, I
apologize because I very definitely did not mean it that way.

Personally, I think you two (Opal and [Black]Briar) are doing a great job with
this place.  It's got a good, coherent theme and I really like the idea of no
teleportation.  Coming to this place is a huge relief from being on Lambda.
There's so much garbage going down on Lambda it's not much fun anymore.  It's
too much work there.  That's why I like this place.  It's relaxed, friendly, no
pressures from absurd social factions.
This is a really good MOO.  I hope it lasts.

Hoi chummers.
I'll start off by saying that this is the first time I've ever mailed a
subscription, so if I don't use proper, recognized 'subscription ettiquette'
then...tough luck I guess. Hey..just playing in character.
Anyway..to the point.  In accordance with the sleazy, gritty dark city theme, I
have been given the go ahead (if you will) to add an element which I think will
make Opalmoo more interesting and eventually a whole lot nastier.
In every Nightcity there's an even darker place which never sees the light of
day.  A place filled with things that only darkness can breed, where the
pariahs come seeking shelter, but find only death and despair. Pardon me if I
wax eloquent.
This place is The Underground.  A sprawling network of abandoned sewers, and
tunnels burrowed by who knows what. It's an undercity that supports a deadly
habitat of it's own.  44 ft lower than death itself, The Underground should be
quite fun to visit..
.but for God sakes...if you do, don't forget a towel and an extra change of
clothes, it's quite damp down there and the last think Blackbriar and Opal need
are characters gettin geeked by a common cold.
ANYWAY..even more to the point.  That's what I WANT the Underground to be. It
is, as of yet, a maze of ideas swirling around in my already chaotic mind. What
I wanted to ask you for was any ideas you have that will make The Underground
more enjoyable.
Also, tell me if you think you'd enjoy it at all. Don't want to do work for
nuthin you know.  That's about it I guess..please reply with any suggestions or
comments. Oh, and if you want an opening to the Underground in one of your
rooms (I was ..
.actually thinking somewhere in the cemetary would make a good location) then
pass it by me. Please, use common sense..no enterances in a residential
building..(mmm..maybe a sub-basement though).. Sorry I digress. There will be
precious few enterances.
Well, I'm finished babbling. responses welcome.

I think it'd be cool if people could get addicted to drugs here. That is, we

Actually, this sounds like a fantastic idea.  And it would be -perfect- once we
better implement this quota-is-money concept, because we could make people
-have- to pay for their fixes... and, of course, there's the possibility of
getting some bad drugs and having it fuck you over, etc.
I understand Xiombarg not having time to do this one; personally, my hands are
sort of full at the moment as well.  If anyone DOES want to do this project,
I'll be more than happy to give any support necessary.  If/when the drugs are
fully ready to go, we can put support for it on $player (or on $opal_class) and
consider the possibility of $drug... but we'll cross that bridge when we get to
it.
Any comments?

The ''Doors'' were programmed by Anne_Merkel and, to be honest, I have no clue
how they work (which is probably because I haven't checked the code out). If
anyone feels like documenting them (hint hint, Anne), I'll make an entry in the

To answer the simpler question, yes, all you would have to do is @chparent your
present exit so that it is a child of #382 (Generic Door).

I'd like to remove commands like ''@add-feature'' and replace them with more VR

losing a feature).

There is such a thing as taking Object-Orientatedness a little too far.  I
think it would be nice to have an OO-equivalent to @addfeature/@rmfeature but
NOT if it means the removal of the @addfeature/@rmfeature verbs.
It's just silly and very inconvenient.  This is the same reason I'm still
firmly opposed to the theory of having to walk to the Editors.  Heck, what if
it's walking that's broken?  You wouldn't be able to fix it *because* it was
broken.
Anyway, I like having OO-stuff but there are limits to reasonability.  So I
say: More OO add-ons, no OO total-replacements.
Of course, that's just my opinion.

Actually, I am thinking about changing the way features work... at least some
of them. There are a zillion ideas floating around in my mind, but I'm not
going to implement any of them until/unless I can, at least, explain them to
Opal (who quite nicely opposes the majority of my crackpot schemes even before
they get to *Theme.

Well, as a technical note, this is incorrect. Things would have to be VERY
broken before they couldn't be fixed. (eval, @program, and .program would have
to be broken in addition to the editors, and I doubt that's likely.)

However, just for the record, the editors WILL work. $room:accept has been made
so that although teleportation doesn't work as a rule, one -can- go into the
editor and return. This will not go away. One will not have to walk to the
editors.

Well, I was talking more about VR than about OO. I want a VR way to implement
features. I think I've got one, too, but... <shrug>

Features are a completely nice LambdaMOO hack. I'm just thinking there's got to
be a more VR way to do it than we're presently doing (which isn't at all VR).
If anyone has ideas, let me know, otherwise I'm jut gonna keep hacking myself
until I come up with something groovy.

yeah but who ever uses @program and .program except for porting?  Besides,
those verbs are going to be removed in the next version of MOO anyway. In any
case, I doubt I could hand-type, line by line, the corrected version of any
code over 5 lines without making any mistakes (as @program requires).

Well, I'd more say that Features are V but not R.  In other words, they aren't
realistic but they are virtual (proggy-oriented).
Definitely curious to see what other ideas you come up with on this.

Subject:  Blackbriar's Grand ``Features'' Theory

(One brief note before this gets started. I can claim next to nothing of the
following as my own. Conceptually, nearly all of this is stolen from
discussions with JoeFeedback on LambdaMOO.)

There are a few ways for features to work.

One way... this is the way I presently see features working... is to add verbs
to the player so that they act as if they were inherited verbs. So I can add
the OpalMOO map as my feature and since it has a verb `map' with args `none
none none' (and permissions `rxd'), I can execute it as if I had that verb on
myself or on one of my parents.

Another way -- this is represented by .known_objects on LambdaMOO (and I think
precious few people -use- this) -- is for objects to be ``remembered'' (in a
way) so that commands on them can be run without the objects being present.
This one, since it's not often used, should be given as an example. Consider,
again, the OpalMOO map I mentioned above. It's got a verb on it which I can use
to read the map if I've got it in my presence (``read this none none rxd'').
This command also matches if I use the object's number (`read #217'). However,
this isn't always the easiest thing to do, and it's even less VR than features
are.
But it would not be a difficult thing for me to ``remember'' this object, so
that if I type the command ``read map'' and there is nothing around which
matches ``read map'' in the usual ways, I can back up and find that there -is-
a `read' verb on the `map' I've remembered, and run that. Thus, having
`remembered' the map, I can `read map' from anywhere and -zap- there's the map,
being read. (Since we've got :contents corified, the map could appear to be in
one's inventory as well.)
I view this as being perhaps the most ideal way to make features VR, but we're
bounced back to the requirement that there be a `this' to match. We gain
nothing except a shorthand to run commands we already can.

There's one more idea I've heard. This is implemented (or maybe not
implemented) as .contents_huh on LambdaMOO. This gets around the requirement
that a verb on an object match a `this'. Let me explain this one by means of
example again.
Let's say I have a sword. I am feeling particularly mean, although not mean
enough to be wizardly, and I want to stab Xiombarg with my sword. So I'd need a
verb on the sword which goes something like `stab any with this' which means
that I'd need to type something like `stab Xiombarg with sword' (or something
like that).
But let's say I had a verb on the sword that went like `stab any none none' and
I wanted to be able just to `stab Xiombarg'... presently, I would only be able
to stab the sword because it would have to match the dobj. This way of thinking
about features lets me match this verb and stab Xiombarg.
How is this different from features as we presently use them? It's not all that
different, except that this is a more VR way of thinking about features. It
would make -sense- that one has to use these in a VR manner.

I'm just spitting these out for thought. Anyone got anything bright to say? I'm
bushed.

The test in #382:@set_key is "if (caller != this.owner)".  Unfortunately,
caller == #-1 on command-line verbs.  Anne_Merkel or a wizard could get around
this with an expression like "(callers() ? caller | player)", or more typically
"(callers() ? caller_perms() | player)", or perhaps something more complicated
than that.

The .program command (_not_ a verb) will be removed in the next version of MOO.
@program and eval will remain as they are (in the database).

Well, it's possible to edit verb code with eval.  It's not easy, of course, but

Couple of quick notes:

Known_Objects is NOT NOT NOT vr.  Don't try to pass it off as such.  It IS a
nice way to give !VR things a nice user interface.  However, there are
convincing arguments against using known_objects in VR situations.  The
canonical example is the Dark Room.  If the room you're in is dark, you
shouldn't be able to read a map, regardless of whether you remember it or not.

What intrigues me about contents_huh is not its ability to take the place of
.features (which it can't except for some mucking about with :contents, which I
regard as kind of gross, at least for the moment).  What I like is its ability
to let an object you carry around give you special abilities: A sword lets you
attack things, a ring lets you fly.  Uh, I have to go, I'll write more later on
why I think features are different.

I think that depends on the implementation. As I'm finding as I make :contents
more and more used, I see that it's possible to have an object in one's, er,
pseudocontents and have it actually -work- for nearly all purposes. So if by
''remembering'' an object we mean ''simulating having that object in one's
inventory'' we -can- make it VR (setting aside that it isn't VR to be in two
places at once).

These arguments hold with the DB as it presently stands. One can read a map in
a dark room without -any- gimmicks, unless the room's got a 'read' verb on it
(which would over-ride any gimmicks I could think of except for player class
inheritance, blah).
The question here is (in my eyes) whether one should put the responsibility in
core, not to permit things that wouldn't be VR, or with the programmers,
expecting them to make VR things with the toold they're given. I see it as
being the responsibility of the programmer to make VR things.

Soory, I hade a check for caller == this.owner instead of player == this.owner.
Caller worked when the verb was !d but here_huh makes caller == room instead.

This is an argument I've seen several times recently, and that I just don't
understand.  The basic framework seems to be "Well, things are bad already, so
we might as well make them worse."  (I'm taking "More VR" to be "better" here.)
Instead, it seems to me, we ("we"?) should be looking for ways to eliminate the
problems that exist.

Uh, I forget what I was gonna say here.  It was something along the lines of
"you shouldn't make it _harder_ for programmers to make things VR".
Incidentally, have you considered installing the hack that prevents
non-programmers (or non-builders) from making use of the objnum hole ("read
#666")?

Subject:  Proposed New :my_huh Setup

The Vision Of :my_huh
=====================
The :my_huh presently in use on $player permits the use of features. I want to
expand on this. Forgive me if this document is crude in places; it has to grow.

I want to introduce what I'm calling, for the moment, SuperObjects (because
Opal seems to love that term so much). SuperObjects will be objects that
contain verbs which may not normally be executable by server matching (i.e.
verbs that contain no `this' to match). For example, a SuperObject can be a
sword with a ``stab any none none'' verb. This would not match under normal
circumstances (and would not execute except for ``stab sword'' which has
limited use).

Notice, too, that these verbs will -not- show up in an @examine unless the
programmer allows them to (thus forcing said programmer to learn about the guts
of the new @examine guts), giving them a certain mystery, a certain intrigue...
a certain je ne sais quoi.

In order for a verb to match as a SuperObject verb, it must meet the following
criteria:
+ The object must be in the player's possession. Real possession. Real
.contents, not pseudo-contents.
+ The verb must be listed in a .super_verbs property. (This property may be !r
if the programmer wishes; it will be looked at with wizperms anyway.
Alternately, a :super_verbs verb may be placed on the object; this verb will be
passed the prospective player and the prospective verb; the verb must return a
true value for the verb to be considered approved.)
+ The verb much be +x. This is a technical necessity, and like all +x
command-line verbs, the programmer should consider the possibility of abuse and
take reasonable precaution if the verb is intended to do something meaningful
and serious.

Assuming that the attempted command has not matched in any of the usual ways,
this will be the next thing checked: Is this a SuperVerb on any of the objects
I am really, truly carrying?

The next thing will be a check of ``remembered objects'' (one's
pseudo-contents, if one will). In order for a command to match on a
``remembered object'' it must meet the following criteria:
+ The verb must match in one of the usual, traditional ways (with either the
dobj or iobj matching the object in question).
+ The object must consent to be remembered (either by having a .memorable
property with a true value, or by having a :memorable verb which, when passed
the prospective player, returns a true value).
+ The verb in question must be +x (again, this is a technical necessity; see
notes above).

Assuming that the command typed did not match in the usual ways and did not
match a SuperObject, this will be next: Does it match a verb on one of my
memorable objects?

The last check is for features. A feature verb will match if:
+ The object is in the player's .features list. (The permissions for features
are already handled in :add_feature).
+ The verb must be +x (see above).

This is the last check: If the command has not matched in the usual ways, or
matched a SuperObject or a remembered object, does it match a feature verb?

I was asked to make clothing for the MOO so people could wear outfits and the
like. With this in mind, I'd like to introduce ``Blackbriar's Generic Clothes''
(#796). To make a wardrobe, all one needs to do is make children of this object
as clothes you'd like: undies, pants, shirts, skirts, etc. If you'd like o wear
them layered (pants over undies, for example), you need to wear one first (wear
undies) and then wear the next (wear pants over undies).

If you'd like to specialize your messages, the following are options:

  @carried pants is "%S carries %t."
  This is the default message for an article of clothing you are carrying but
not wearing. When people look at you, they will receive, as part of your
description, something like ``He carries pants.''

  @worn pants is "%S is wearing %t."
  This is the message someone will see if you are -wearing- an article of
clothing. It will appear like ``He is wearing pants.''

Both of the previous messages come from :carried_msg and may be specialized as
desired.

To set messages when you remove or wear clothes, look at the following:

  @wear pants is "%N %<wears> %t."
  This is the message which everyone will see when you wear the article of
clothing. You will see ``You wear pants.'' and everyone else will see
``Blackbriar wears pants.''

  @unwear pants is "%N %<removes> %t."
  This is the message which everyone will see when you remove the article of
clothing. You will see ``You remove pants.'' and everyone else will see
``Xiombarg removes pants.''

And I was asked why I made these changes -- so I figure I might as well tell
all.
One of the goals of OpalCore is to make a more flexible core. While it can be
handy to have the distinctions be $player/$builder/$prog this also has some
disadvantages.
I've been pushed by insane people to break up as much of LambdaCore as possible
into features so that they are more easily controlled. (If you don't want
random people being able to use @contents, put it on a feature and control who
may use it, for example.)
Thus, $builder is going to contain only those commands necessary to be a a
builder. $prog is going to contain only those commands necessary to be a
programmer.  And the handy utility commands will end up on features.
I'm incoherent. Ask me again later.

Perhaps it would be more helpful if programmers had the Programmer Feature by
default and builders the Builder Feature, etc.?

I don't see how AutoDuelling fits with the OpalMOO theme.  Seems that if I want
to kill someone, I'd just stab them in their sleep.  Anyway, I think an RPG
system would be a mistake.

Wow. Shades of Harlan Ellison.
Some thoughts here -- this would mean [1] cars, [2] streets being distinguished
from sidewalks, and [3] a meaningful ''death''. Not that I object to any of
those (except I believe firmly that any ''death'' coming out of this has to be
recoverable)... but I think it'd take a lot of work.
How about a demolition derby, where people could get into cars and beat the
crap out of each other in a specified area? There's some prime real estate I
could set aside for you...

Yeah, well... I think the main question would be whether it's fun. <grin>
I think that the dueling kinda thing fits in real well with the OpalMOO Theme,
but that may be because of a short story I read a few weeks ago about auto
dueling. I don't think that it's -too- far removed from gangs and drugs and the
like...

>  Anyway, I think an RPG system would be a mistake.

Actually, this is something that perhaps deserves its own post, but I won't
bother because it's early and I'm on a roll. I think that here it depends on
what we mean by RPG. Surely, OpalMOO's not a hack-slash kinda place; the goal
is certainly -not- to kill one's fellow citizens. But I think it's not entirely
too far removed to say that the introduction of drugs and other such evils
(guns, for example, or gangs, or what-have-you) will lead to a sort of RPG
system.

What's the odds of my being able to smoke this joint and not start acting like
a total idiot?  What's the odds I can sneak up on Opal and rob her of quota or
possessions and not have her notice?  These are things that -would- fit in
theme, and -might- be considered RPGesque.

I dunno. I think that in -this- case it might be better to start with something
small. Make cars, before making auto duels. (Notice, too, that Jordan has a gas
station, something probably worth using if you're gonna make cars.) If you need
any help, lemme know. I'd be interested to see what happens.

well, I think that it would be a good idea, myself. I think that
if its developed, that it doesn't need to be in the town proper,
but rather on an abandoned freeway outside of town like blade suggested
originally.
this means that sidewalks and streets would only have to be
distinguished out of town.
also, might be a thought to decide if OM is based in the current setting

Bb is right, though.  We need to make a generic vehicle that will only work in

How about a -lot- of wizard dust, since it wouldn't work any other way?

Since I can't imagine a situation in which anyone would -refuse- quota, I think
all we'd need is a command to -give- quota to somebody and to send mail to
$quota_log and the recipient and the giver. I'm not gonna write it, but I'll
help anyone who wants to.

Well, this is in response to the question regarding the time-frame of OpalMOO.
After talking it over with Baby Briar, I realized that I didn't really have a
GOOD idea of exactly WHEN OpalMOO is.  (If that makes grammatical sense.)
So, I thought about it and decided that OpalMOO must exist in the future, but
not the way distant future.  We are not cyberpunk, and we are not Orwellian,
but due to the dilapidation of the place, we must be in the future.
So, when creating things and programming, keep this little bit of info in mind.

So I got out my BIG BAG of wizard durt and made the @transfer-quota command.
Check out the help screen. It's pretty easy to use, and it's NOT REVERSIBLE (so
if you give your quota away, it's gone).

I was wondering...

Many of our new players are coming here from LambdaMOO, and expecting (whether
this be a reasonable expectation or not) that commands will be similar and that
things will work the same. In most cases, they will be right. However, we're
hacking here with absolutely no intention of maintaining similarity with
LambdaMOO.

Does anyone think it'd be worthwhile to try and make some documentation
detailing changes between OpalMOO and LambdaMOO (or, perhaps, between OpalCore
and LambdaCore), or should people just be told to read the available
documentation?

OK, it's useless OpalMOO trivia time...
Out of the 155 players when I checked, 110 have a gender that's not neuter,
Spivak, JoeFeedback or elephant. Most of those are neuters, like guests,
players who haven't logged on yet, housekeeper, etc.
And what are the male/female stats do you ask ?

Well, I have them, but who really cares ? (73 vs 37, you figure it out).

I think a good thing for a MOO to have is some puzzles or something interesting
that people can come and use and interact with. It would make things more
interesting for plain players and guests and such. I'd be glad to write
something that's not too huge, but I don't have any good ideas really. And I
think copying the scrabble board would be kinda weenie, so don't bother
suggesting it.

Anyone ?

How about gambling?
A casino could easily fit in with the OpalMOO theme, and would be loads of fun.
If you wanted to make it _really fun_ you could allow people to wager quota.

Praecox likes the casino idea.  How long would it take to program craps?  Nicht
lange.  On the other hand, I think we might have a casino which has other sorts
of games, the kind one would never see IRL.  I say this because I think black
Jack is the most boring game in the world.  Why stop at card games, or the
arbitrary twistings of fate (roulette)?

But definately slot machines.  I'll program generic old ladies to be playing
them, if you like...Perhaps 1 quota = 100 chips or something.  You could
transfer them back and forth at the `cashiers'.

BTW, this isn't a vote *against* blade.  I just don't know what Nomic is,etc.

I think the possibility of losing quota would be rather  frightening, but I
think it would be cool.
I like the idea of 100 coins for 1 quota.  That way it wouldn't be too risky.
Slot machines could be made to either dole out more quota on average or take it
away, depending on the wizards views on how much quota is floating.
Mafia thugs could be created to reclaim excess quota if someone gets too lucky,
beating the crap out of the gambler in the process.

Subject:  Player Harassment

Recently, I've gotten a number of complaints from OpalMOO players about other
OpalMOO players, regarding such things as sexual harassment and general
annoyance. I wanted to post some thoughts on that matter, and to remind
everyone who hasn't read the OpalMOO Rules to do so (they're in The Hallway,
but they're also available with the traditional `help manners').

SEXUAL HARASSMENT

The following text comes from the OpalMOO Rules:
| It is important to keep in mind that OpalMOO players are,
| as a general rule, not here to seek relationships. If you
| believe there is a mutual interest between you and another
| player, it is your responsibility to ask before taking action
| which would, in Real Life, be considered inappropriate among
| acquaintances. (Abbreviated form: ``The OpalMOO wizards will
| tolerate no sexual harassment.'')

It seems some more information needs to be given on this one. Please don't run
around kissing people you don't know. Please don't assume that everyone here
wants to be hit on. Please respect other players' wishes regarding your
advances.


ANNOYING OR HARASSING BEHAVIOR

I'd give the following as an INCOMPLETE list of things one shouldn't do:
+ Move a player who doesn't want to be moved
+ Send a LOT of text to someone who doesn't want it
+ Refuse to leave someone alone who wants to be left alone
+ Sending messages you -know- are offensive to people who don't want it

This MOO is intended to be a social, friendly place (although the wizards tend
to get cranky and fight a lot); please respect that.

<sigh> I dunno -- I don't want to have to discipline people, I don't want to
have to @newt or @toad or ban people from OpalMOO. But as always happens in
social environments like this, the complaints have started, and I -do- need to
respond. I have -not- spoken with Opal about this; these are solely my own
opinion. But I'm told my opinion carries a decent amount of weight around here.

I -am- open to comments here. I don't want to be dictatorial; I also don't want
to alienate people by allowing unacceptable behavior. So.

Subject:  Gambling

I was thinking about how to work quota-gambling yesterday... the 100 chips (or
whatever number) per quota sounds good, but there would have to be some
mechamism for changing them in and it would have to be secure enough such that
people don't just edit their chips and cheat'n'stuff.
Also, there is a problem of where all this quota goes to and comes from...
gambling is not a 50/50 prospect... after a large enough amount of time, the
house will have won a surplus of quota and players will, as a group, have lost
it. This means that people are going to whine to the wizards for more quota,
which would probably not be too desirable. On the other hand, if the games were
slightly in favor of the players, uncontrolled quota points start popping up,
leading to uncontrolability of quota by the wizards.
Also, assuming regular gambling practices, ie the house has a winning margin in
the long run, who is the house ? I'd be glad to take all your quota, but
somehow I doubt this would make gambling a real fun propisition, espically if
some bum gets lucky and cleans me out. Gambling like there is in the COWsino on
Lambda is pretty safe, but that perhaps takes the edge off of it... you know
you'll get another cheque in a month to do more gambling...
My final point is that I had hoped for something everyone could use, as quota
gambling would preclude regular $players and guests for using it. I was
thinking of maybe something along the lines of the underground wall-pushing
maze on Lambda... although something original would be a bonus. Mabye a
sewer-pipe maze ? Might be kinda spammy on objects though...

Anyways, just my 2 denarii, Dante.

I disagree.  I think it should be possible to drive anywhere that the car will
fit.  Only slot cars stop working once you leave the street.  Maybe if the
exits had some sort of Maximum Headroom value or something.
I think it would be cool to have cars not be able to fit into the Lobby doors
but I should easily be able to cruise in on a motorcycle and mess up the
carpet.

Maybe the $login.welcome_message should be changed.  You have to admit that the
opening line "There's a pair of handcuffs by the bed." later followed by
"preferring the warmth of their shared bed" might encourage the idea of a
sexual theme.

Hm. I mean, there -is- a sexual theme here, very much so at times. I think the

I notice that the verbs on the PathFinder feature (#378) conflict with the
verbs-of-same-names on the Teleportation Feature Object (#151). This makes me
wonder whether the Teleportation Feature's any use to anyone but the wizards

There should be an overall monetary system established here.  You could call it
anything (credits, dollars, etc...).
There could be a bank, and when u get an account, there could be a charge card
feature object with a verb PAY -amt- TO -char or account-.
This could work if implemented properly.  OpalMOO has the ideal of emulating
RL, so, a person could design a shoppe or store of some kind and sell objects
to people.

From:     u-dude (#738)

Subject:  monetary system

I have an introductory proposal for a monetary system on OpalMOO.

I.  The bank
     The bank will will have a banker who has total control over the system
(wizards are exempt from the monetary system).
     There will be a 'banker' who will be given control of the banking system.
     The banker will be decided by a vote of the wizards and me (since this is
my idea).

II. Charge Card Feature Object
    Every user wishing to have an account must add this feature.
    The feature will contain the verbs necessary for the managment of there own
account with the following verbs accessible to the user:
       @make-account
       @acc-info
       @show-log
       @transfer-funds
    The banker will have access to the following verbs:
       @suspend-account
       @rm-account
       @welfare
       @acc-refuse
       @create-account
       in addition to the other verbs

III. Transactions.
     For every transaction, there will be a log of said transaction in both the
effected user's accounts, and the bank log (of which only the banker has access
to).
     The following verbs would be used for objects to interact with the system:
      :check_amount()
      :check_balance()
      :pay_to()
      :update_acc_log()
      :update_bank_log()

IV. Account Information.
    The account information will be arranged into the following format (subject
to change):
    Acc #, Owner, Balance, Status

V. Restrictions.
    Only the banker may ahve access to bank information.
    Even the wizards will not be permitted to have access to the information if
they wish to become a part of the monetary.
    the banker can be replaced if doubt is cast on their ability to manage the
system, they will be replace with vote of the wizards and me.
    You may have extrappolated it, the wizards and myself will be the board of
governors. (it's my idea, my plan, i have the right to be a governor)

 Basically, the acc # is the object #, meaning a slot machine can have it's own
account, managed by the owner of said object.

Any ideas, gripes, volunteering of coding, etc are most welcome.  reply either
to me or *theme for everyone to remark on.

Perhaps it'd also be nice to have a bank where someone could go in and open an
account and get information without need for using the feature object? (Maybe a
passbook, even? Geez, you make me think!)

I don't entirely see why the banker needs to be a person. Can't the bank be
purely automatic?

I'll be happy to -help- with this. I think it'd be interesting to see what

This doesnt seem like much of a bad idea, though I think a completely code run

But if thats the way its not meant to be, then The person who codes the

And credit cards would be better than passbooks...

OK, events right now are always channeled through rooms... but, how about
events that are sent to specific objects for specific actions ? Specifically,
when you move _any_ object, you send it an event_move message. And the
destination should be sent an event_enter, if the move is successful,
regardless if the destination is a room I think. (Does enterfunc get called on
$conatiners ??)

if someone has a NEED to shout to everyone on the MOO, but there

critical problems and notify everyone if the server needs to go
down for some reason.

 I was wonding if it could be made an offical rule that shouting is forbidden,

 I've noticed both BlackASP and Vortex using a verb to communicate with
everyone.  I would think that it is not necessary to do that.  If you need to
talk to someone then you can page them, or if you need to talk to a group ASP
has a walkie-talkie for such stuff.  I find it very disruptive.
This is just my humble opinion, and discussion is welcome.  = )

Yes, Opal told me after I sent that last letter.
In my opinion, removing a player's ability to protect eirself is a bad move.
If it is a question of OO-ness, @gag should be replaced with something that is
OO.
Removing a player's ability to protect eirself means that Wizard intervention
will be more necessary than before.  Do the Wizards really want to take on
extra babysitting duties?

I have the means to create and list the accounts now.  I decided against a

Only the board member can execute these 2 verbs, i have yet to programme the

I assume you mean VR?  What's a VR equivalent of @gag?  In real life, when I
don't want to hear what someone's saying, I tune them out, or ignore them, of
kill them or something, but it's not something smooth and seamless.

OpalMOO is, alas, not so tolerant a MOO as some others.  If there's a person
that others need `protection' from, e's most likely gonna be toast for a week.
And, upon returning, if e still doesn't behave, e's probably gonna be toast for
longer than that.

That's not a bad idea... if we could establish a way to kill each other
permanently, that would be a perfectly VR solution.  It would also be very much
"in-theme".  Perhaps the victor would gain ownership of all the loser's
objects.

Okay, okay, I was joking.  I certainly hope no one took me seriously (although
I'm sure a few people starting drooling over the idea of killing a Wizard for
their bit).
Briar does have a point though.  One of the simplest solutions is to avoid a
person you don't like.  If you have a home-room of your own, you could always
make the exit a door and lock the door.  This would be just like real life.  If
you don't want someone to come in, you just keep the door locked.  If they get
in somehow, @eject them.  If they page you... well, there's nothing you can do
about that but ignore it.
However, this does suggest the need for knowing who is on the other side of
your door before opening it.  I'll make a $door with peephole and security
chain tonight.
Ta for now.

The Generic Door with Peephole (#1580) is now ready for use.  The only

Only @chparent the side of the door you live on to have a peephole or people on

The bank works!  The basics are there for the player to function.
The average player can:
  @make-acc
  @pay
  @acc-info
usage: @make-acc
   That's it.  it will tell when your accoutn is entered.
usage: @pay -amount- to -person or acc #-
   The amount can't be more than what's in your account.
   The person must be in your room, otherwise, use their obj #.
usage:@acc-info
   That's it. it shows the account information for your own account.  You can't
   look at other people's account info.

The board members are:
     Me (u-dude)
     BabyBriar
     BlackBriar
     Opal.

The board can execute any of the preceeding verbs, plus these:
  @create-acc
  @show-acc
  @list-acc
  @bank-trans
  @welfare

usage: @create-acc -person of obj #-
  Create's an account for that person or object.  At the moment, only player's
can have an account.

usage: @show-acc [-acc # or player-]
  Without a name, it shows all the accounts.
  Otherwise, it does and @acc-info like action, but on any player's account.

usage: @list-acc
  This is the first version of @list-acc.  no formatting.  no options. Just a
list.
   oops, @show-acc, not @list-acc.
usage: @bank-trans -amount- to -account-
   The bank started with a finite amount of money ($1 trillion).  This allows
the board to transfre money to a player.

usage: @welfare -amount-
  This command adds the specified to everyone's acount.  This money does not
come from the bank, but an invisible government elsewhere.

The feature object is in the works.  Please to do NOT add it as a feature to
yourself.  It doesn't work, yet.

OpalMOO -is-, in large part, sexually-themed.  However, that does not remove
the assumptions of consent which are, in my opinion, required.  I agree,

Well, since I _am_ Anne Merkel, I have to complain (it's part of my character,
you see).
`help theme' doesn't say anything about sex.  It does say "Gritty and Sensual"
but "sensual" is very different from "sexual".
Perhaps `help theme' should be re-phrased.  I would like to point out that a
sexually-themed MOO is likely to attract players who think sexual harassment is
just part of the game.  Perhaps it should be treated as just part of the game
since that would be more theme.

In any case, keeping in mind the likelihood of sexual assault here, I'm
building generic mace.  Watch for it, coming soon!

  Well, I guess I need to put in my 2 cents worth in on the subject of
sex and the theme of this MOO...

  I do not think the message posted by the BabyBriar seems appropriate
for a word based public access MOO...  As Anne Merkel pointed out, the
theme of this MOO is 'Gritty and Sensual', not sex.  I am opposed to the
idea of this MOO moving to a theme of sex!  I like sex as much as the
next guy, but this does not seem to be the place to promote it.
Personally I would like to see the theme as it is and I hope the wizards
will stay within the bounds set for the theme.

Well, actually, if the Wizards want to do something not included in the current
theme, they can just change the theme to whatever they feel like.  I mean,
they're the wizards.  Take a look at `help democracy' to see what I mean.
To quote: "OpalMOO: Not A Democracy"
I'll be the first to admit that the wizards always have top say as to what the
theme is but I also say that I dislike the idea of a TinySex-based MOO.

As this makes the 177th posting on *theme, which supposedly deals with
"themely" issues, I don't think one posting about sex, even if it is a rather
effective one that sticks in peoples' minds, indicates a trend towards an
orgy-centric MOO.
Sex IS implied in the theme, I think....look in the welcoming statements...but
it ISN'T and has never seemed to be (at least to me) the main focus.
Actually, a rather nice, realistic, touch, IMHO.

I have to disagree on philosophical grounds.  It is, to me, the anticipation,
consideration, surrounding sex, that is sensual, particularly on a
telecommunications medium.  I suppose if I were willing to play with words I
could make something out of sex being anti-climactic.  :)
But, as lambda's *smut overwhelmingly (to my mind) proves, explicit statement
is far less intrigueing than hinting, innuendo, which allows the mind to fill

The post was, I felt, done in good taste. It described the act without being to
'medical' or needlessly 'erotic'. The idea isn't so much to get turned on by
the description of the process, but to give you a good guide of what to go out
and do. Maybe *theme wasn't the perfect place for it, but I think it was a
better place that *core. Perhaps Briar should have just put it in Mack's News
in the first place, I dunno. I don't really feel the piece was offensive
though.

I was going home last night and I happened upon a man who had been beat bloody
by some kids. Luckily someone had already called an ambulance and my help
wasn't needed. Maybe offensiveness is all relative, eh ?

Paris, who's still a little unnerved by it.

I wasn't actually offended by the tantric sex article.  My complaint was that I
thought it was unwise to post it to *Theme.
Heck, I'll probably screen-capture the article later myself.
But, I feel, it really did belong in Mack's instead.

Okay, as a wizard who is NOT BabyBriar, let me put in my say on the matter.  I
was not here over the weekend, and so I had no idea as to what was going on.  I
guess this is what I have to say...
OpalMOO is NOT and will NEVER be a MOO in which sex is the theme.  Chaning the
theme is not what Baby had in mind when she posted her post.  I'm sure she
found it interesting, and thought others would to.  However, *theme was far
from the place to post it, as even she now realizes.  It is with this thought
in mind that I am going to make a new mailing list to be called *Etc.  This
mailing list will be for ANYTHING that does not have a place on other lists.
This can include, sex, violence, personal musings or recipies, I don't care.
My feeling on sexual harrassment is that it SUCKS and is not at all to be
tolerated.  Sexual joking around can be understood.  Yes, our theme does
promote discussions and joking around regarding sex, but the wizards stand very
firmly on the grounds of no harrassment.  As someone who has experienced far
too much sexual harrassment in her short life, I can say that I will not be
very lenient on people who choose to interpret our theme liberally enough to
include sexual harrassment.
That's what I have to say.  Be on the lookout for *Etc.

Hear hear!  Well said, Opal!
And BabyBriar:  I'm sorry I made such a big deal out of it but I wanted to find
out just where the wizards stand on sex in the theme.  I think it's ridiculous
to think there won't be anything sexual here.  I just don't want anyone to get
the idea that the wizards want an All-Sex-MOO.  (Although an All-Sex-MOO might
be a fun idea, it should be somewhere else [and if one exists, can I have the
telnet address, please?]).

Subject:  Re: money makers

Well, we could have outright charity for one... start everyone off with a fixed
amount of money. People who do things for the MOO might have income... ie. if
you have a business or do something the would conceivably make money and you
try to contribute to the moo (the only way I can think of this is via being a
programmer, but I wouldn't rule out other ways of contributing) you would get
an income...

Now comes the question of what to do with income ? Charge for making
descendants of your objects ?? One thing I've always wanted is the equivalent
of somesort of constructor verb on an object so that ann object could set
certain things up when you @chparent to it. Maybe there could be a mechanism
whereby if you @created or @chparented to one of your objects, you could charge
for it.  Whether or not people care to make money-back guarantees on their
objects, I dunno.  I suppose enough money could also eventually be exchanged
for a point of quota ever perhaps... Although I'd hate to have that as the only
means of getting a quota increase.

Anyways, just some ideas, Paris.

Subject:  Monetary System?

A monetary system?  There are a lot of things to consider.  One, right now Opal
is fairly similar to the East European countries in their days of communism --
Most things are owned/controlled by a central authority.  If we wish to create
a capitalist economy, we need to consider privatizing the Moo.
I am not sure that this is logistically possible, or even desirable.
We can try a socialist, but market economy, that can work in small systems.
Paris mentioned income; that sounds great, but we MUST have a fixed amount
of currency.  Inflation can get out of hand real fast.  Oodles of neat
concepts come to mind with this topic; taxes, wages, robbery, production...
These last two bring up some problems; will we allow robbery, or illegality?
Will robbery be illegal?  Will we have any laws?  And what can we produce?
This is a VERY cool idea, but the magnitude of establishing it
concretely is overwhelming.  Maybe I am imagining a much more comlex system
than necessary.

                         Rosette is now at OpalMOO.

Rosette is a feature that Carrot wrote on LambdaMOO.  It was designed to help
you find the exits in the room.  It is very simple to use.  It is a compass
rosette that shows all the compass direction exits and obvious exits. Examples
of common uses for @rose are:

@rose                  returns a rosette of the exits in the room you are in.
@rose #11              returns a rosette of the Hallway.
@rose Library          returns a rosette of the library, if it is in your
                       .rooms
@rose #17 -n           returns a rosette of the exits in the living room with
                       room numbers for each destination.
@rose +n               locks room numbers on, so every time you use @rose you
                       get room numbers until you @rose -n.

To add it to your features use:   @addfeature #1400
I am working on the automatic feature for @rose.  I hope to complete it soon!
Please send me any problems of bugs you find.

That's... what I want... that's what I want....
..erm, excuse me.  Got carried away for a moment there.

Two points on Money:
1)  Quota
Since money and quota are not the same thing, we should probably have quota not
list as dollars.  Maybe make it more themely.  Like say I have 12 quota and I
do `inventory'.  I might get the message:
      You feel like you could run down 12 backstreets today.
..only something a bit better than that.

2)  How to Earn Money
a)  Welfare -  Why not have the bank issue a monthly welfare check of $500
dollars or so.
b)  Building -  Players who own object which are widely used (via childing from
generics owned by the player or running a useful public area like the Hotel)
should get a monthly income based on the amount of use.  Counting children
would be easy to calculate.  Places like the Hotel could be calculated based on
the number of adjoining rooms provided by it.  It would be up to the bank work
out the income for other things.

Ok, here's my -2 cents worth...

I like Anne's idea about getting money through usage of areas and generics.
Also One should be able to get money from owning a vending machine(ie like
BeeKay's gun machine...)
Also have a little taken out of the persons money for each object you own and
distribute it to the owners of the parents.
Maybe charge enough per object per month that if a person has normal quota and
is using it all, he/she/it has no money left from the welfare amount given by
the bank every month.
But money shouldn't be too easy to get, the theme here IS urban decay...

BTW, I like the idea of the power grid, too. Possibly have some objects that
have to be in a room that is connected in order to work...

Actually @rose -n is *not* what turns on the room numbers...
If you are in The Hallway and try @rose -n, you will indeed
get the room numbers for the exits.  But it is not how you
lock the feature on.  @rose +n will turn on the room numbers
as well as lock it on so the next time you use @rose.  And,
of course, to turn off the room numbers you use @rose -n.

Actually, let me expand on this thought slightly. There are, essentially, two
error messages one can get when one types a command that isn't executable
(barring, of course, traceback):
  I couldn't understand that.
 -or-
  I don't understand that.
The first error message given comes from the server when you're in a location
that doesn't have a :huh verb to run (essentially, it comes when you're in
$nothing and you give a bogus command); the second comes from the
$command_utils:do_huh family of parsing stuff, and it comes into play when you
give a command that doesn't work.

Because the `I don't understand that.' comes from  in-DB, it could be modified.
What would you think of having this message vary with the `newbie'-ness of the
player, so a new player would get something like `I don't understand that. See
`help commands' or `help introduction' or go soak your head you damned newbie.'
An old-timer could see something like `I don't understand that. And you should
know better by now.'

Damn, I've blown this whole idea to hell by making it whimsical. Does anyone
see what I was -originally- getting at?

I noticed this a while back on JaysHouse...he were are trying to, for all
intents and purposes, "become" our characters within the context of the game,
but the error messages do not reflect this, seeming to refer more to the game
itself.

As an example:

 >look box
 I see no "box" here.

This to my mind is annoying, and atmosphere destroying. I changed this on
JaysHouse to read:

 There is no "box" here.

However, the problem with this occurs with "multiple" objects. For example
 >look boxes
would normally return
 I see no "boxes" here.

As long as we're on the topic of changing the error messages, how about
:explain_syntax()?
One modification I can think of for :explain_syntax() is for it to point to any
help text on the given when available.  It shouldn't display the text, just
note that it's available.

Hm. I can see that being, perhaps, a decent idea. How would it be implemented?
Just checking for in-verb documentation?

What comes to -my- mind is that this would be another good application for the
newbie flag. Newbies would get verboes help information when they screw up.
(Perhaps everyone could start out as newbies, and they could decide whenever
they wanted that they weren't newbies no more.)

about the newbie flag....
I think it is a good idea, but not many TRUE newbies are here. most people
who are on opal, have been on a MOO before. (prolly Lambda)  While not
all people are programmers, I think that it should be possible as a
not programmer/builder to set the newbie flag for off, so that they don't
buried when all they want to know the syntax for @dig or somesuch.
perhaps a verb? (unnewbie me?)

On JH, we have things vaguely like two of the things that have been suggested
here.  I'm not really happy with either of them, but I thought I'd mention
them.

:explain_syntax() looks for a "Usage string" in the verb (if a matching verb is
found, of course) and prints that out if found.  I this this should be done in
a more OO way--let the object that defines the verb decide for itself how to
print out usage information.  And provide reasonable defaults, of course.

We also have @misc-options +expert_user: "You will receive shortened prompts
and usage information".  So far I think only @create uses it, though.

Subject:  Money

I'm not really clear on exactly how the bank's money system works to begin
with.  For example, can you carry money around with you in various amounts or
is it done solely by credit card transactions?
If we can't actually carry money around, we won't be able to steal it from each
other.  In other words, plastic money is boring.
And what about credit cards anyway?  I understand there's some sort of credit
card feature object.  Wouldn't it be better for the credit cards to BE objects
so they can be lost or stolen?
It seems to me that the fundamental purpose of money on OpalMOO would be the
chance to steal it from each other.

If someone could help me with the basis of the money system, I could work up an
object-oriented approach to cold carriable cash.

Okay, I'm willing to work with the bank officials to get money working in some
format.
I've been thinking about the problems with a collective money object and I
think I get around it the restrictions by having some help from the wizzes.
One question still remains to me though... why green?
Who says it has to be American money?  What proof is there that OpalMOO is set
in the US?  Why not pounds or yen or, uh, some other foreign currency?
To me, the answer is that it should be American money.  And it should be in
dollars only.  No change.  My reasoning for this is that most keyboards have a
$ key and no "cents" key, no "pound" key, and I don't even know what the symbol
for yen is anyway.

So I can get a system of money working without to much trouble.  Of course, I'm
about to leave for Spring Break in a few days so it may have to wait if you
want me to do it.
Do we have a projects board here?

Let's take a brief look at #6145 from LambdaMOO, the `generic portable room'
(written by sol, #4290). The verbs defined on it are:

=> {"l*ook", "location", "enter", "g*et t*ake", "d*rop th*row",
"take_succeeded_msg otake_succeeded_msg take_failed_msg otake_failed_msg
drop_succeeded_msg odrop_succeeded_msg drop_failed_msg odrop_failed_msg
arrive_outside_msg leave_outside_msg arrive_succeeded_msg oarrive_succeeded_msg
arrive_failed_msg oarrive_failed_msg leave_succeeded_msg oleave_succeeded_msg
leave_failed_msg oleave_failed_msg teleport_outside_msg oteleport_outside_msg
teleport_msg", "moveto", "is_unlocked_for", "@lock_entry", "@unlock_entry",
"exit leave out", "look_outside", "announce_move", "yell", "@listen", "tell",
"outside_msg", "journey", "move_ok", "@move_ok", "add_prop", "delete_prop",
"list_prop", "secure", "$nothing_msg", "sweep_msg", "go", "@about"}

Let's look at the verbs defined on Vortex's portable room (#1704):

 => {"l*ook", "location", "enter", "g*et t*ake", "d*rop th*row",
"take_succeeded_msg otake_succeeded_msg take_failed_msg otake_failed_msg
drop_succeeded_msg odrop_succeeded_msg drop_failed_msg odrop_failed_msg
arrive_outside_msg leave_outside_msg arrive_succeeded_msg oarrive_succeeded_msg
arrive_failed_msg oarrive_failed_msg leave_succeeded_msg oleave_succeeded_msg
leave_failed_msg oleave_failed_msg teleport_outside_msg oteleport_outside_msg
teleport_msg", "moveto", "is_unlocked_for", "@lock_entry", "@unlock_entry",
"exit leave out", "look_outside", "announce_move", "yell", "@listen", "tell",
"outside_msg", "journey", "move_ok", "@move_ok", "add_prop", "delete_prop",
"list_prop", "secure", "$nothing_msg", "sweep_msg", "go", "@about"}

Ok, now I admit this -could- be coincidental, and I was gonna let it slide
except for the fact that Vortex claims to have written this his very own self.
So let's pick a random verb, say `sweep_msg' and look at the first line of its
code:

#1704:"sweep_msg" this none this
 1: if (!($object_utils:has_callable_verb(this, "tell")[1] in {genport, #26152,
#1150}))

This line looks -precisely- like the line from sol's original code, except that
it's got `genport' instead of the original #6145. On the other hand, it must do
Pluto's MOOse Lodge Attic some good to be specifically referenced in the verb
(and #26152 will be pleased as well, if it ever exists on OpalMOO).

DO NOT STEAL OTHER PEOPLE'S CODE. If you must port things from other places,
the LEAST you can do it NOT CLAIM IT AS YOUR OWN. Serious programmers spend a
HECK of a lot of time designing code and it's REAL annoying to have a
self-proclaimed cracker stealing it.

Don't piss me off like this again.

More and more, people are porting stuff from, I must confess
that I am even guilty of such act. (with @rose)  But there needs
to be a limit to this.  OpalMOO is *suppose* to be different, as
a matter of fact, I remember reading recently that the OpalCore
would be drifting further and further away from Lambda...
Doesn't this indicate that OpalMOO is not just another Lambda?

Ok, Ok..  Sure, a lot of the programmers here *are* from
Lambda and as a result many *ideas* will seem to come from
there as well, but there *should* be a limit, no?  I ported
Carrots @rose from Lambda because I was use to the
command...  Should we use create a WHOLE new environment
with totally new command...   Like I say, there should be a limit
somewhere.

 Obviously, if some feels the *need* to port something here
they should at least have the decency to give credit to the
author!  As Blackbriar said, people really do put a lot into there
code, and surely Vortex (or anyone for that matter) will not
want everything written in MOO to be -r?  OpalMOO is a place
programmers to *experiment*, no?

Actually, I don't think it's necessarily bad to port stuff just as long as the
porter completely understands and documents _all_ the verbs and can explain it
to anyone who needs it explained because porting stuff means taking complete
responsibility for the object.  It isn't fair to expect it to be
self-maintaining.
So, as long as Vortex goes through and writes some really thorough
documentation for the car he ported, I don't see any problem.

I don't know if we're gonna have an rpg system or not, and I really dont have

who's been screwed over by certain people on the LM rpg system.
1. Don't even let the GMs be able to screw with their stats, it'll just cause
trouble.
2. If you're going to have player killing, make it all or nothing. It's either
`You're in the system, you can be murdered' or `Nope, players can't kill you',
but make it apply for everyone.
3. Don't be making tens of thousands of special rooms that cause damage when
you leave, but not when you go into the verb editor (try it) If a rooms' gonna
cause damage, have it always do it.

Sorry if this rambles, it's late.

My smaller problem is that he ported a fairly large object we could just as
well have designed here. That's not such a big deal; I've ported good things
and so have a lot of other people.

My larger problem is that he claimed to have written it himself, both here and

I agree.  When you port something, you take full responsibility for the
maintenance and documentation of that object but that does not give you the
right to claim all credit for its design.  I have ported things to and from
other MOOs and had some of my stuff ported too but I have not yet had to deal
with such outright stealing.
`Stealing', in a role-playing sense, is in-theme.  Infringement of programmer's
rights is not.
Personally, I think that if Vortex does not fully understand all the workings
of the object he ported or does not come forth on this infringement, the car
should be @recycle-d.  We'd be much better off designing one from scratch than
working with a complex one we don't understand.

What's perfect about an object that was written for LambdaCore, not OpalCore,
and makes reference to undefined variables such as `genport' and makes

I'd like to see more nasty games like a Rat Pit where you bet on how long a dog
on speed will last in a pit of rabid rats.  This is commonly known as
"Ratting".
Or the standard street-con Three-Card-Monte.  Actually, Three-Card-Monte would
be a neat travelling street game.
Of course, we'll need carriable, losable, easily transferable money first.

Ok, this sordid affair is finally finished. This is how things went in the end:

The Generic Interior Room (#1778), which was written by yduJ on LambdaMOO, is
now owned by her here (not that she's been here for eons). I will, however,
check it for consistency with OpalCore.

The Generic Portable Room (#1704), which was written by sol on LambdaMOO, is
presently owned by Hacker. I will look at it for consistency with OpalCore and,
when done, give it to whoever feels like being responsible for it.

I didn't want things to go this way, but they did. Have a nice day.

Okay.  We've read enuf about this.  This is stupide. 1) The Generic Portable

Vortex did indeed port such a simple item, Vortex should be ashamed.  It was
too easy to make from scratch.  If Vortex did port is and is claiming credit

All right, people, run with me on this.  If there is a demand, I can create a
system that will work out all the money problems we have.  It will be called,
ala Shadowrun and perhaps many other sci-fi settings, a Credstick.
A credstick is, despite its name, a debit system.  For the first credstick a
person makes, a little bit (or no) money goes into the account.  That's all,
just the first.  If someone wants to give someone money, just 'transfer 150 to
Jack'
If you want to steal money, just threaten the person with a gun, and if they
accept the threat, they will transfer the money to the person.  Otherwise, they
are shot.  I understand that limits the types of robery that can go on, but
people can work around it.
You will be able to add multiple people onto the account, and only the first
owner can remove people from the account.
For businesses, all someone has to do is create a second credstick, restyle it
as a cash register, and 'Voila!', a company account.
This will encourage people to build, although not necessarily 'nice', at least
interesting places to go.  For example, if I can ever get him away from his
schoolwork, Sandman has a nice club that could become a hot-spot for OpalMOO.
If not, he gets no money, and cannot, if it gets implimented, pay his electric
bill, so the place goes down, and he has to rebuild or remodel or something in
order to start over.  In order to gain capital to start his electric again, he
could either get dontations, or take out a loan.  If people want to stay at a
hotel, the hotel owner can make the residents pay by the night, and apartment
landlords can charge by the month.  With heavy fines, natch, for breaking a
lease, if so desired.
The system will not work well, however, without utilities such as electricity
(people who want to get fancy can even start water, not necessary for life here
yet, although it could be with minor modifications.
Also, with enough money (Wizards or arb will have to decide how much), you
could buy more quota, as obviously whatever you have is worth buying.  And, if
you have enough descendants of your object, you can even make money.
If anyone likes this, let me know, if anyone prefers to program this
themselves, but will give me extra money for the idea, let me know.  If there
is enough intrest but no programmer willing to take it on, I will start it as
quickly as possible.

Does it have to be a credstick? I thought OpalMOO was not cyberpunk.
I'd rather see a wallet, which, although conflicting a little with the

We should have both cash and a credit system(like the credstick).
That way, people can choose which they want.
Cash would be much easier for person to person transfer while a credit system
would be easier for programmers.
As for the idea of a credstick,
The proposed theme of OpalMOO is "twenty minutes into the future," a credstick
or, even better, some sort of digital credit card would be in theme.

The theme of OpalMOO is "gritty and sensual". It never was and never has been
"twenty minutes into the future."  When Anne_Merkel asked what the TIME of
OpalMOO was supposed to be, we sort of agreed to the "twenty minutes into the

That isn't the actual theme, it was a half-joking suggestion I made when we
were discussing what the OpalMOO time setting might be.  For those who don't
recognize it, it's a reference to the old Max Headroom series.  However, it is
_not_ officially the time-setting.  Personally, I tend to think of the time
setting as being consistently about a year from today; slightly in the future
but still closely associated with the present.

Although a credit card / credstick system might be a good idea, I still think
we should have actual dollar bills.  Besides which, I already built them and
have them almost completely debugged (actually, I don't know of _any_ bugs left
but they always turn up).  However, a credit card system might be a nice
*additional* system.  You could even have credit card bills and thugs who break
your legs when you don't pay.
By the way, currently I'm working on an ATM for the bank to get the money from.
I'll give further updates as developments arise.

PS - I like Jack's idea about cash registers.  I'll try to work up a system for

That's one idea. In this particular case, the feature in question is being
designed and is in progress. (I don't think it ought to be a feature anyway,
but that's just my personal taste.)

I'll think about modifying the feature case. That's a decent idea.

I was hanging out in the bank just today, experimenting with my account as it

transfer all of his funds into my account. "Much obliged," I replied. Hell, who

A moment later Avarice 'ported in, shook hands with Lust, opened an account,
and proceeded to do the same thing. I could see a pattern beginning to develop
here.
My theory was proved right as Pride, Envy, Gluttony, Anger and Sloth all came
to the bank, one after the other in quick succession, and did the same. So here
I am with an account containing $3993...am I set for a night on the town or

There should have been a block to prevent Guest-character accounts to begin
with.  Security on the Bank is pretty lax.  A log is helpful but there needs to
be more than that.  Besides, it's pretty much assumed that anything that _can_

Subject:  $Cash and Banks

I was just thinking... u-dude's Bank gives away $500 with each new account.
But where is it getting the $500 from?  Is the Bank printing its own money?
In real life, a Bank actually contains money which, I think, it borrows from
the goverment Mint.  Actually, I'm not real clear on how money is distributed
but I know that the Bank can't just whip it up out of thin air.
So does this mean that if the Bank starts actually using real money, instead of
just numbers in the accounts, that the Bank would quickly find itself deeply in
debt?
For that matter, if the Bank can't just give it away, where would money come
from in the first place?  Should the Bank be so unbelievably humanitarian as to
give away $500 with every new account?

Perhaps what we need is some sort of Mint and Loan system so that the Bank can
borrow money from the Mint.  Then it could charge interest on the accounts it
has so that it can earn the money needed to pay back the Loan from the Mint.
And the Bank could start calling the original $500 a Loan and charge interest
on it until it's been payed back.  That would give everyone a starting base of
cash but they'd have to pay it back in installments and if they didn't pay it
all back, they'd get their kneecaps blown off or something.
What do people think about this?

But what about prostitution?  Or Loan Sharking?
Maybe there could be a bar where players could dance naked to try to earn some
cash.
What about jobs?  Could players have some sort of jobs to earn money?  Maybe an
employeement office?
Then there's welfare, a small amount of money given to the player once a month.
This would come out of the Government's pocket.

First, let me begin by saying that ultimately I think we all need to
defer to u-dude as far as how the Bank will work, unless you want to
create your own bank :-)

Having said that, I will now proceed to forget I said it and give you
my opinion on the economy of OpalMOO:

In a previous message, Anne said:
 Money doesn't grow on trees.  It has to come _from_ somewhere.
Well, here I have to disagree. Money is a way of keeping track of the
exchange of goods and services. There's no reason the bank CAN"T create
its own money. In fact, in Colonial America, banks just did that. As
long as the people affected agree to use that money, it can be
anything at all, and come from anywhere at all.

In another message Anne said:
 What ways could players get money to pay back their loans?
My personal take is that the economy here would be based on the use
of services. For example, u-dude would earn an income on transaction
fees and interest on the bank. I could earn income by setting up a room
or service that charged for entrance/use, and so on. In this scenario,
those who are innovative, and continue to create useful things will
do well. Those who sit on their duffs, will have to get by with Welfare.
I believe this is how it should be.

Look forward to hearing y'alls thoughts on this. And I want to thank
Anne for bringing this subject up for discussion/debate. Hopefully among
us all, we can forge a system that will make sense for OpalMOO.

Yours,
Ewan

The bank CAN create money, but should be very wary of doing so.
Germany did just that in the 1930's, and it was not long before one
needed a suitcase full of bills to buy a loaf of bread.
Inflation is a bad thing.
I think we are making a big jump in going straight to a monetary system.
We don't even have bartering yet.  We have precious little to barter, let
alone buy and sell.  Don't get me wrong, I think the bank is a great idea,
but without the essential background of actual products, services, and
trading, it will be remarkably similar to a grade-school `Get-to-know-
how-our-economy-works' activity, where everyone makes cute little crafts,
the teacher hands out money and lets the kids buy things.  It's fun when
you are in third grade, but it is not realistic, and by no means stable
enough to last more than a few days.

Please don't think me a fool, but how can a moo have inflation?
If $ is created at one end, can it not be recycled at another?  Or are
you afraid of misers?  Either way, I can understand the concept, but
since the fact is that this is -not- real life, there are ways around
the currency problems of real life here.  I mean, the economy here can
be controlled.  what if the 'mint' or 'main bank' controlled the amount of
$$ circulating.  there can be X dollars floating around at any time.  Any
excess that has not changed hands in X time gets recycled or something.
To make it VR, maybe the bank send hoods after the miser to take this $$$

Also, I prefer the idea of green bills the most, but credsticks or any of
that sci-fi stuff is a bit far flung.

Lastly my thoughts on the 'era' of OpalMOO after exploring a bit and reading
help theme, reading all *theme and other subscription folders, is that
OpalMOO seems to be a 50-ish place, in the film-noir sense.  I think that
'gritty and sensual' are the essense of film-noir.  another point of looking
at it is that the place seems rather 'twin peak-ish' it has that wierd aura.
Any feedback?

Well Anne, since you asked :-)

I see no reason why u-dude should NECESSARILY have a monopoly on banking
in this MOO. The question comes down to which currency or currencies that
people who charge for things, or work for currency(s) are willing to
accept. For example, say I were building a subway, and had turnstiles for
taking a charge to ride the line. Am I going to accept several different
coins, force everyone to translate coins into tokens at a ticket booth, or
simply not admit folks who don't use a specific currency? And if I decide
to accept different currencies, one way or another, how do I establish the
exchange rate?

Note, I'm not saying this couldn't be done, or that it would even be
undesirable. I'm just interested in how you see such a system working.
Of course, if you're volunteering to code the exchange portion... :-)

Yours,
Ewan

Subject:  Money (woo woo), it's a hit...

Several years ago there was an interesting MOO called CyberMOO which, as I'm
sure you can guess, adopted a Cyberpunk theme and had a real "grim'n'gritty"
atmosphere developing. Unfortunately it closed down, never to return, but
before it did there was a number of interesting objects created:  it had a
realistic city-type theme, like here; it had cars and motorbikes, like here; it
had money, like here...but unlike OpalMOO, Cyber had megacorporations.

The Megacorporations employed people to perform various tasks. Every now and
then you would receive mail detailing a mission you were to perform, such as
delivering a package to a certain point, escorting an employee from one of the
opposing corporations, assembling a motorbike...the potential for missions was
enormous.

Each Megacorporation paid in its own currency.  After a period of time, an
exchange centre was established, where currency could be traded.  Some shops,
affiliated with the various corporations, accepted only one form of currencty.
The smaller shops accepted all, but charged extra for doing so.  The values of
each currency was originally the same...as more people chose one Megacorp over
another, this began to fluctuate.  The effect was very atmospheric, and very
*exciting* in a way I have yet to experience in any other Mud.

OpalMOO reminds me a lot of CyberMOO in its infancy.

We should allow multiple forms of currency. But if we wish to do so we should
start establishing some standards now.

Competition is healthy.

Morpheus!
Finally, something interesting about money!
Frankly, folks, I don't see how implementing money and sitting back and
enjoying it is going to do anyone any good. I believe if money is to add in any
way to our experience on OpalMOO, it must be intricately woven into the story
of life.
I believe that Morpheus has shown an interesting way to do that.
Can we talk about this for a while?

I had no intention of milking the bank through the guest
characters, if I had there would have been no explanation as to
how I did it posted here, I would have just kept my mouth shut.
The reason I did such was because there was a similar hole in the
Lambda bank when it first opened.  People tend to ignore others
when they say, "Your object isn't secure enough"...but if you show
them the problems then they soon take notice.

u-dude, I seriously doubt there would have been any repercussions
as to my hacking some extra cash for my account. Maybe money will
become central to the essence of this moo, but at present it's
just a quaint intellectual exercise, and the money in my account
is merely a bunch of worthless numbers.

Currencies?  What currencies?  At the moment, u-dude's bank works on a credit
system.  It stores the accounts and allows a player to transfer fund from eir
account to another while at the bank.  It doesn't hand out currency.
I've been working on currency ($cash) but it isn't all the way functional yet.
There are still many bugs to work out.  However, if it does work out and
becomes the established form of currency, there's really no reason that it
should be passed out ONLY through one bank.  Competition between banks may even
make it interesting.  I want my free toaster with my new account!

I've got $cash functioning.  You can carry it, drop it, drop only portions of

Or rather, I can do that.
Unfortunately, it only works with my version of smarter get/drop/give
(discussed in 185 on *Core).  I haven't been able to find a way to get it to
work without it without making changes to most of the Core objects and, even
then, it would fail for many specialized cases.
Anyway, it works.  If smart get/drop/give gets implemented, we'll have real
cash.  If not, back to the drawing board, I guess :)

Subject:  $Cash, Inflation, and Sources of Income

$Cash is now ready to roll.  It works perfectly for all types of actions that
I've tried.
Now we just need to find things to do with it.

One of the problems with inflation is that a small amount of money becomes
worthless and it takes large amounts of money to buy something that cost much
less.  Therefore, there has to be much more money in circulation.  In an
object-oriented system, this can cause severe db bloat.
I would like to see costs on OpalMOO stay low.  For example, a gun would only
cost $25.  A car would cost $500.  A packet of cigarettes would cost $1.
However, if we all get monthly welfare checks of $500, those prices will
skyrocket because people will be able to afford too many things.
I suggest that the welfare checks only amount to $50 a month.  If players want
more money than that, they'll have to find some way to get it.  (And ways to
get it will be provided, I assure you).

In any case, to help stop inflation, I'm only giving the Treasury of OpalMOO a
set amount of money which will total less than the sum of its accounts.  The
Treasury will receive more money later.
The result is that all the money in OpalMOO existing as actual $cash will stay
within limits.  There will be a few other ways to get $cash other than the
bank.

One way I've thought of for getting money is through Loan Sharks.  Once we have
a way to lose money, I'll create Loan Sharks which will loan you money with
%100 interest.  But what could they do to you if you don't pay?
Also, didn't someone say they wanted to get a gambling system working?

At the moment, the bank is still under construction so I'm not going to
actually release any money (and it is NOT fertile ;D) until someone finds some
uses for it.
Suggestions?

I don't like the idea of money being an all-around necessity, nor do I like the
idea of money == quota.  But there would be some things that do require money,
just like you have to have a programmer's bit to program and you have to own a
room to @sethome for it.

When I said stuff costs $x, what I meant was that it would be a neat way to
make money from your inventions.  You keep the object non-fertile and then set
up a vending machine that charges money for the object.  The object qould still
cost the player a quota point.  This could be a good way to implement things
that are considered very rare or special.
And there could be services that cost money too.  All sorts of stuff.

code but there are differences that are distinctly your style.
I would like to offer to have the @Rooms Feature @chown'd to you since it is,
after all, your code and I have no claim to it.
Again, I'm sorry.

Okay, this may sound very very corny, but my first thoughts about the 'time
period' of OpalMOO were that it would seem to fit very well to use the
anachronistic approach Tim Burton did in BATMAN, where the people dressed like
it was the forties, and reporters used old flash powder trays, and all the
radio mikes came straight out of the golden days, but interspersed with all of
this was technology from the nineties and beyond. Like even though they had the
old radiomikes, people had color tv's and vcr's and the like, aand then there
was all Batman's gear...  I bring this up, because I think Burton put all this
anachronism together in a very smooth, non-jarring way, and I think that sort
of thing could really enhance the atmosphere here.. Or maybe not...

Just a passing thought (let me know if it should keep on passing)...

It looks like Trystan doesn't want to remove the @rooms storage from his

So now I'm trying to find another solution.  Should it be a safe assumption
that ALL players have the Teleportation Feature in their features or should I
create a player class specifically for this?
@Rooms storage should not be limited to use by only one Feature and you
shouldn't have to maintain a seperate list for every Feature you use that wants
a @rooms list.  What other ideas do people have for this situation?

Well, I'm working on a Generic Multi-Compartment Container. It's a
modification of $container that lets you have multiple ''drawers'' to
store stuff in. And it's all done excpet for one thing:
The ''get'' verb doesn't work. See, each ''drawer'' has a name and a
preposition associated with it. This is to simulate storing stuff both
''in'' and ''on'' a box, for example. So to get something from a GMCC,
I'd have to type something like ''get thingy from under box'' This dictates
a verb of ''get any any any'' on the GMCC. Problem is, such a verb doesn't
match. I get a ''I don't see any "thingy" here.'' message instead. I suppose
I could eliminate the ''from'' prep, but then ''get thingy under box'' looks
clumsy to me. Comments? Ideas?

Hey, a slight idea if you do change super-verbs.  Allow dynamic allocation of
verb names.  In other words, let something like :super_verbs on the object
redefine the verb name called by the parse, so, for instance, if "pocket <any>"
is superusage for pockets, and, say, I want a pocket named "bag", calling "bag
<any>" automatically gets re-routed to "pocket"...

Actually, come to think of it, that might get insecure.  Hurm.  By the way,
from personal experience, super-usage is *not* easy, and what's hard about it
is not actually programming the :super_verbs (actually, I think that's a really
nice feature...I hope you don't get rid of it entirely) but rather the parsing
problems that having multiple copies of super_verb-ing objects in the "parse
space".  Specifically, it's kinda a bitch to deal with the fact that the player
might have been trying to match object 2, although object 1 intercepted the
super-verb.  It's a problem endemic to superverbs, since the *entire*
assumption is that the player isn't specifying the superObject.

I don't really have a solution to that problem.  I did a contents check for
other appropriate objects, calling them if necessary, although I think that
poses a minor security hole (who cares, it's only pockets anyway! sheesh!).  I
suppose the player could always just manually modify eir .contents order in the
proper location by dropping and picking things back up.

Anyhow, the lesson is that superUsage requires a bit of extra worries.  Which
is cool.  Not a complaint.

Profane wondered how to get the parser to consider "from under" as the
preposition string, instead of just "from".  Well, I suppose you could quote
the preposition, but I'm not sure that would work.

A better solution would be superverbs.  Just keep the `get' verb args as any
any any and put whatever sophisticated matching in GMCC:super_verbs.  Surely it
would be easy to  check for a match of GMCC + aliases in the argstr (esp.
iobjstr in this case).  Complexities would be added in the processing of the
args in the relevant `get', once it finally gets called.  E.g., you wouldn't be
able to trust parser parsing of prepstr and iobjstr, but I suppose you're
equipped to handle that....Hurm...yeah...At least the verb would get called.
Hope this helps....

eliminated the ''from'', so now it's just ''get thingy under box.'' More
silly looking, but much less of a hassle to program (I don't feel like messing
with super-verbs).

Subject:  Abandoned Mall

Hello, I was talking to Blade and a few others and we liked the idea of an
abandoned mall where one could loot. We also felt the need for being able to be
caught so we would want wandering cops/security guards. I would volunteer to
create the mall. And I would like to talk to whoever was working on the
wondering thugs, as the wandering cops would be similar creatures.

Anyone with any ideas on what the looting could involve? The physical layout of
the mall will be fairly easy, but I would welcome ideas on the mechanism for
the looting.

Anyone think an abandoned mall is a good idea?

Could an occasional cop be brave enough to wander into the streets of OpalMOO?
If wandering thugs, why not wandering cops? Not too many of course. :-)

Who is working on the RPG, anyway? If no one is, I'm tempted to make a "thief
PC class", which allows one to steal from another player (but only other
thieves, at the outset).

Actually, I'd suggest designing a simple Generic Living Thing which would have
certain basic abilities.  This would a child of the Core Object and a parent of
Generic Player.  Extra skills like theivery would be accessed through skill
objects parsed through Living Thing's :my_huh() (like Feature Objects).
This would allow easier design of NPC's and dismiss the need for player classes
(which would limit the player to only certain things at a time).

I'd be willing to build this but Jack_Scratch says he's already working on
something.

Would Anne's system work for theft? I mean, with a player class one could use
the player's own move ability to move things they don't want moved, to make
stealing work. How'd this work with my_huh? Wizard blessing of theft verbs?

I think an RPG is vital to the growth of this MOO.
This will attract people who arent programmers or social butterflies.
Also, it will get this MOO populated.  An urban jungle with lots o' people
would be very theme.
Unfortunately I dont know enough to code an RPG, but Xiombarg's proposal of the
Generic Character seems to work for me...

Also, I think if we want to make OpalMOO really 'sensual and gritty' we should
make something on the MOO that is required for survival...
This would be very VR and be a good platform for the RPG. Maybe make it,
somehow, so that a player automatically gets just enough money to pay for this
survival need, so you don't have to play.
But, it would be a good springboard...

I think the hotel is overcroweded only insofar as all rooms are taken to lead
off the lobby, instead of their respective floors and hallways.  I understood
this was getting fixed.  Is it?  It's been broken far too long.

Okay, I've been putting together a simple RPG system.
So far, I've got 7 basic abilities defined: Agility, Strength, Dexterity,
Intelligence, Endurance, Sense, and Chutzpah.
Agility is how nimble the player is.  Strength is how strong they are.
Dexterity is how well they work with their hands.  Endurance is how much
physical pain and stress than can stand and still function.  Intelligence is
their IQ.  Sense is how much Common Sense they have.  Chutzpah is how well they
can get away with things without getting caught.

What sort of things would people think are needed in the RPG?

Well, skills that seem an absolute must are combat skills (unarmed, knife,
gune, etc.) and/or the ability to steal, pickpocket, pick locks, and such
things. Skills like "seduction" or "con" might be nice, too.
Also, how are abilities decided? I prefer a system where one has x number of
points that one can distribute as one chooses. This goes for skills as well.

Hmm.  What flavour of RPG system are people interested in?  From a technical
standpoint, the Shadowrun or Vampire systems work quite well, with an
attribute being, basically, the number of chances you have to accomplish a
given task.  (IE str = 4; hence, you roll 4 d6 to check.)  They also include
the concept/attribute of luck, which can be REALLY handy.  From a careful
pick of attributes/stats, most other skills should be derivable.
Pickpocketing as a function of dexterity and luck, seduction of charisma/cool,
and so forth.  Any feedback?

Yes, there is a gameroom!  It is in the MOOse Lodge.  There is a Scrabble

Subject:  RPG Abilities and Vampire/Shadowrun

The way I see it, most specific abilties like "backstabbing" and "lockpicking"
can be derived from the other basic abilities.  I plan to set up a simple
system to create all sorts of new abilities based on the Basic Abilities.
Highly expandable is my plan.

As to Vampire and Shadowrun... unfortunately, I've never played them.  My
beginning tinkering has been partially based on stuff from Paranoia and
Villians & Vigilantes.  I've been genericizing stuff as much as possible (which
is why you don't see any abilities like robot-repair).
At the moment, I've just been experimenting around with different types of
skill-checks but nothing concrete so I'm open to suggestions.
For example, what range should abilities be in?  What's the average value?
What special modifiers should there be for this theme?  For example, since
we're all in this gritty-backstreet-theme, should everyone get an extra boost
of street smarts (Sense)?

Well, there's a decent mixture of Philadelphia and Cleveland in here. For
examine, the apartment building and apartment twelve is a Cleveland touch, but
apartment eleven is a Philadelphia touch. A lot of the public areas, too, have
mixtures of Cleveland and Philadelphia.

But is it safe to say that OpalMOO is some mixture of Cleveland and Philly? I'm
not sure. I'll let Opal touch that one when she gets back.

But no, OpalMOO's city doesn't quite have a name.

LET IT BE PROCLAIMED that as of this time, a PUZZLE has been introduced to

There is a security hole in the OpalMOO database which allows one to gain

to identify this hole, specifically, through mail to the *Wizard-List group.
(Mail to a wizard specifically, and/or conversations with wizards, do NOT
count.)

This is a known hole. It is being left unpatched for purposes of this contest.
(Extra quota for someone who finds a -different- hole!)

Wizards and their other incarnations are not elegible. Nor are players who
already know about it. Good luck!

Here's a thought...
Maybe this city is so derelict and run-down that it's true name is lost to
history.  No one knows what the city's true name is and is called many things
by different groups.
Perhaps a sort of puzzle-adventure could even be built around solving the
mystery of the missing name.
I guess it depends on just how gritty the theme is.  Has civilization decayed
or just the architecture?

The hole you are looking for does NOT require that you do anything destructive

gaining unlimited quota for yourself, also makes you unable to log on to the

Just a bit of clarification.

REgarding Dhalgren, should anyone *not* wanna read the book (it's a thick one,
though Delaney's best on ever, INHO),  the city is kinda like a Sci-Fi version
of Detroit.  Abandoned, fucked up, and twisted.  Gangs, people in parks, and
lotsa wierd red contact-lenses that people wear.  A good idea.  There are few
sci-fi-esque elements (aliens, technology) apparent.  Probably not a bad way to
think of Opal...

So far I've heard mention of Detroit, Philly, and New York with varying levels
of technology, corruption, and corrosion.  I can hardly wait for Opal's
upcoming history of this city.

Even if you don't particularly care about the OpalMOO core, you may want to
@peek 263 on *Core... some server modifications have altered (temporarily

Reply-to: *Theme-Issues (#120)

I've only got a few more days here before I lose access for what may be the
whole summer. That really sucks. But it's a good time for reflection.

At approximately one a.m. on November ninth, OpalMOO was started for the first
time. It was a mad frenzy of random building and topologically absurd
undescribed rooms all linked together off of what is now The Hallway (#11).
Opal and Triptych and I wandered around this empty place and tried to think
what it would be like once it started to become really groovy. We hadn't
expected things would grow so large; OpalMOO was started as a place for Opal
and me, some sort of weird romantic gift, but we couldn't let it go without
inviting people to it, and... you know how these things go.

Hell, we didn't even know if it -would- get to be really groovy. Until November
23, when we got the official OK to let it run `as long as system resources
permit.' By this time, we had approximately twenty-five players on the MOO, and
we were approaching object #400.

The growth of OpalMOO was assisted by the exodus from LambdaMOO. Even being
freed from the allegedly oppressive rule of the wizards didn't save us; people
fled to what were the OrbitMOOs, which (if I recall properly) were OpalMOO,
JaysHouseMOO, FinalFrontierMOO, and PlayHouseMOO. (Presently, only two survive:
OpalMOO, and JaysHouseMOO.)

We evolved quickly, using a new `@examine' protocol, corifying the use of the
:contents verb, and using various hacks for features and other parsing stuff.
We were evolving quickly and things started to get really weird.

Praecox and Greene asked if they could design drugs. I said sure, and they
bullied me into designing multiple-ownership for the MOO; this is one of the
totally neat parts of OpalCore. (I really wish it were finished, but that's
another matter entirely.)

And now, we're sitting here with a constantly evolving core (a core, by the
way, which proves to me what I'd suspected: if programmers are given an
environment which encourages them to be innovative, amazing and wonderful
things will come of it) and a brand new wizard.

So I get to leave for the summer. I'm not worried; the place is in capable
hands. But I felt the need to say, before I go back to New Jersey, that I am
really looking forward to coming back to OpalMOO and seeing what's happened in
the next few months. And when November ninth rolls around again, let's see what
we can show for our first year. (Who knows -- maybe OpalCore will be in greater
use than LambdaCore!)

Take care, y'all. I love ya. Have fun. (And good luck, Edison!)

Well, this isn't going to be the history of OpalMOO as I see it, since I Think
Bb summed that up pretty well in his post. But I do want to at least let people
know what is up with my summer since I am going away.

I will be in Texas, with somewhat sporadic access to the MOO. We have recently
purchased a computer with a modem, but I think my parents and sister have first
access to that, so I'll be relying on going out to UTSA where I have my
secondary account.

I will try to log on once or twice a week, if only to see what's up and keep up
with the things Carter_Edison does. I hate to leave the whole place in his
hands, but we totally trust him, and are not at all worried.

Well, your friendly neighborhood wizard must not be as great as some f us
think... She just got kicked out of her house and has nowhere to go and noone
to stay with and absolutely no money. (Well, ten cents in my pocket)
If anyone has any ideas, frequyer miles, extra money lying around, or
suggestions let me know. :)
I'm not sure how long I'll have access since I'm losing a house. :)  But I'm
gonna try to at least go out to UTSA a couple of times before I get kicked off
for good.
If I don't get back here at all....
Love ya all.

Well, having an RPG doesn't necessarily make it any more of a `game' than it
already is (yes yes i know its ``not a game'').  It just depends how integrated
the RPG is with the core surrounding it.
-jo.

Hemlock brings up a good question.  My intention with the RPG is not that it
become the main purpose of this MOO.  Mostly, I just wanted to write an RPG
because I had been hashing around the ideas for one over the past year because
the LambdaMOO RPG just doesn't seem very good.  I wanted to write the
definitive MOO RPG so that, if someone wanted an RPG MOO, they'd have a
sophisticated, object-oriented, modular, easily-expandable base to start with.
When I implement the existence of the RPG here on OpalMOO, it won't be
everywhere.  Well, I mean, it will be active everywhere but, in the main area,
you won't get jumped by street gangs.  Other players may fight you but I'm
going to set up an option where any player who wants to can keep other real
players from fighting with them.  The only areas where RPG `monsters' will jump
out at you will be clearly defined `scenario' areas.

OpalMOO isn't a game.  It can, however, contain games.

One very good way that you can help decrease the DB is to delete your old
messages.  Some players have over 50k of old mail and one player even has 156k
of stored mail.
Please delete this old mail with the @rmmail command, followed by the @rmmail
expunge command (which kills the phantom mail stored for @unrmm).  If you want
to save your messages, save them on your own system by using @netforward to
have the mail sent to you; that's why I wrote it.
Please please please don't save old mail that you don't need.  I don't want to
have to delete other people's mail but I'll have to if the existence of this
MOO depends on it.
This goes triple for you mailing-list owners.  Archive, archive, archive!
