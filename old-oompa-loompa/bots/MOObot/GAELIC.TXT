Subj:   RE: maybe this can help
     
     
Craig,
     
I collected it over the last few years from 3 or 4 books as well as all
the vocabulary Marion and others would add to the Gaelic-L memos.
     
It could use some "cleaning up" as my lack of Gaelic grammer has allowed
multiple entries. Gaelic-L may be just the place for it.
     
Regards,
     
Kevin
