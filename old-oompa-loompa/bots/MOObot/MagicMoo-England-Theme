MAGIC-MOO Information:
----------------------


MagicMOO is a moo based at Aston University in Birmingham, England..
It's running on a Sparc IPX, users in england will notice a dramatic speed
difference to moos running in the US or elsewhere.

Theme of Magicmoo?  Talk and have fun basically, it's a programmer's haven,
since its release in March 1993 many interesting and useful programs have
been developed creating a fun and enjoyable atmosphere.

Please feel free to log on as a guest, if you like the moo and would like
a character don't hesitate to contact a wizard or mail *wiz with a character
request.  Programmers are especially welcome, but don't think for a second
that there's just programming on..  NOOO!!!!

MagicMooers frequently organise pub-crawls in Aston, Birmingham..  Although
this may be a little out of range of some of our international users, it
certainly isn't for British users.  Past pub-crawls have included users
from Kent and Wolverhampton.

That's about it really..  Remember if you're logging on from the states then
we are all 5-7 hours later than you.

Have fun!
