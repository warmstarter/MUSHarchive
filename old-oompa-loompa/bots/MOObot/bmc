(Does anybody have a problem with the title sounding too much like the smut

Welcome to OpalMOO's very own *BMC list.  In keeping with the infamous
"theme", maybe warm fuzzy isn't the way to go on this list.
How do we work "gritty and sensual" into a mailing list?  Any thoughts?  Post
long poems about how lovely the bathrooms look with our underwear draped about
it?  Oh, well, if it VAGUELY relates to BMC at all, post here and we'll all
spam the list about it... Yaz (with thanks to BB, who is still, btw, not a
nice guy)

Okay, seeing as I have seen Yasmin's Butt up close, I must say that it is
very very nice.  It is, as she points out, not a tail. Nor for that
matter, does it talk.  IT Is A MUTE BUTT! (ask her. thats what she told me)
And as for Opal, I would like to point out that Yasmin also has wonderful
eyes. (which are prolly also mute...) (grin) I know that sounds like a cliche,
but it is so very true.
I would love to go on telling all of you what I really like about Yasmin,
anyway, thats my 1000 lira worth. (or whater the exchange rate is that
works out to be $0.02 )

Subject:  Tomorrow.

I dunno who this is to. I suppose it's more of a plea than anything else...

Tomorrow, I return to Ohio. Back home, back to my apartment and my cats and
the accumulated possessions of several years. And I begin, in earnest, to
destroy said things.
Boxes and boxes, but more importantly bags and bags of trash. My life is gonna
be tossed away, in large part, for a fresh start in a fresh state.

I'm nervous, I'm scared. There's a lot of reasons for this move. I want to go
back to school. I want to be closer to home. I don't want to be in Cleveland
any longer. But it would be lying to myself if I didn't admit that nearly the
entire reason I'm moving is because of Opal.
I want to be closer to this woman, I want to get closer to this woman. Our
relationship has gone to far up and so far down, sometimes real real quick. I
crave stability here. I so, so want a `normal' relationship here. I hope she
grows to want it as well.

Please give me strength. Please give me compassion and sensitivity. Please let
my efforts prove to be worthwhile in the end. I have come so close so many
times; please give me insight that I don't ruin everything again.

(i'm starting to think i need a *Prayer newsgroup)

Lord, please give me patience. Make me calm. I can't go on like this, burning
out every relationship I've ever had by being too possessive and too
overbearing. ``But we're -not- together,'' she reminds me, and in large part
it's my fault. Please help me, temper my love with patience.

A) He's too good to be true.

But then again, there are always dozens of guys wandering around BMC with
luggage. Maybe a tomato on the head would be a good idea, Zip.

Subject:  The Cat Epic

Once upon a time, BB decided that he wanted to move to BMC to take up air.  He
wanted to be really obnoxious, so he decided to bring along his three cats to
consume as much BMC air as possible.  There was one slight problem with this.
BB doesn't have an apartment and BMCers are NOT supposed to keep kitty cats in
their room.  Where would BB's three little kitties go?
BB has a natural bias towards this big ugly (in my opine, just because of the
icky light gray wanna-be castle-esque addition to the side near Guild) stone
science building called Dalton Hall, est. 1892(?).  Dalton is a bizarre
building; I'm gonna leave it at that and anybody who wants to know more about
WHY it's bizarre can come visit.  He decided to put Merkin, Lucifer, and
Chesire (the three kitties) up in the attic of Dalton.
This was shortly after he had arrived (ick, a date!) on Friday (if I am wrong
I hope you all will flame me).  They were generally terrified and didn't like
being in a strange place.  The attic of Dalton is made of little winding dust
and electronic/power tool filled rooms and insulation (LOTS of that).  Over
the weekend, Cheshire was discovered to be gone.  So on Tuesday, BB, Opal,
Sylvia and myself all trampled off to Dalton in search of the cat.
We started out at around 6:30; Merkin and Lucifier were running into and out
of this hole in a wall filled with insulation.  We all in turn climbed in
there and noted that there were little pathways in the eaves of the buildings
that were filled with insulation that the cats loved to play in.  Some secret
doors were found that led into "rooms" that were padded on all sides with
insulation that formed a circle of unfinished space around the attic rooms (am
I being TOO unclear?  Just come look at it so I don't have to stretch my
writing abilities).
Someone had gotten a flashlight and we were busy tearing Dalton attic apart
bit by bit: crawling into little spaces, trying to get doors to come off their
hinges, wriggling through rooms filled with big tall rejected science
technology flotsam, opening secret doors and walking out into the padded
insulation rooms.
Sylvia, to her credit (YAY Syl!), found the cat.  Cheshire (a female, btw) (BB
is QUITE particular over his cats' sexing, btw.  You said "it" in reference to
a cat and he would very self righteously point out what gender that cat was.
Just so y'all know.) seemed to be in the bottom of a very deep and dusty all
brick unused heating shaft.  The Anthro mail bag was sacrificed to make a
little basket to lower down into the hole with tied together electrical cords
and wires; it didn't work.  About this time someone (Opal?) decided to go talk
to the Public Safety men (it was past 8 at this point) to talk about what was
happening with the cat. The only way one could see that Cheshire was alive
down there was to hold the flashlight and wait for her eyes to blink at you or
for her to move, which she did seem to be doing.  There didn't seem to be a
way to get her out of it, though.
Public Safety showed up in the form of one inept and slow but sweet (imho)
security guy.  He didn't know what to do either.  He and Syl tried to figure
out where the shaft went to by having Opal and eventually me yell down the
shaft.  (BB was looking for the other two cats, who had gotten lost again.)
We were all getting itchy and scratchy from the fluffy punk fiberglass and
everyone was worried.  The Public Safety guy gave up, told us to call
Facilities Services, the police, and the humane society.  Having found the
other two cats and carted them to the basement (poor poor Merkin in a rat
cage), the four of us decided to see if we could find out where the shaft
"Pain and terror, the insanities of desire; not accidents, but essential."

There's a pair of handcuffs by the bed. They're surrounded by empty Chinese
food cartons, an empty bottle of wine, and two wine glasses. One of the
glasses has fallen over, leaving a red stain on the carpet which slowly
creeps towards the handcuffs.

The alarm clock went off an hour ago, but the room's inhabitants have shut
it off, preferring the warmth of their shared bed to the cold of the real
world.

went.  This involved fun stuff, like breaking and entering the pigeon labs,
the rat labs (eerie room), and the offices of several esteemed professors to
climb on top of sinks and tables and creaky stepladders to see into
painted-over attic spaces.  It was in Professor Gonalez's office where the
Public Safety guy found us and wanted to tell us that we had to leave the
building (no comment about the fact that we were in a professor's office, just
that we had to leave the building).
So we grabbed our coats, put the other two cats in a somewhat larger lab cage
and walked back to Opal's room, where the cats were dutifully deposited.  Opal
and BB went back to Dalton to make sure that everything that should have been
locked in the morning was locked (there are keys EVERYWHERE in that building.
Sylvia is a key goddess, btw.); Sylvia and I went to wash the itchy stuff off
of our bodies.  Everyone waited tensely.  The next day, BB and Sylvia went to
wait for the police to arrive at about 3:20.  However, the police had an
emergency and couldn't make it.  BUT Facilities Services broke down a wall of
Dalton to excavate Cheshire, who was a stressed out kitty but was alive and
remarkably well for falling down a huge 60-70 foot shaft.
So they all lived.  Sometimes living is better than happily ever after.  BB
has 4 out of 4 again and all of them can still claw him, which is good on all
counts.  (Btw, I would move that BB be allowed to take up BMC air now that
he's inhaled cancerous amounts of BMC insulation.  It's only fair.)

     This is, now that it's over, a quite funny story.  The professors of
anthropology, though, still think that there are dangerous lunatics running
around stealing little things in Dalton (which was established in 1893) so
anyone who wants to check out the plethorous keys should watch their tracks.
They're wise to us.
     I found it hysterically funny to know what was going on and to nod and
smile to those grown-ups trying to track down the mail bag, etc.  :)
Altogether, I think it's for the best that Opal let Public Safety in on the
fiasco.  They're pretty used to students doing wonky things anyway.

Dear Intrepid Mawrters and Sundry,
     I live in Dalton.  My thesis is due to the anthro department in 3 weeks.
I spend a ridiculous number of evenings --> nights here.  Spelunking in Dalton
is a Bad Plan these days, I strongly advise against it.  Stuff has smissing.
I wouldn't be surprised if they soon decided to change all the locks; stuff
has gone missing from locked offices of professors.  (Now, I have absolutely
no proof that this has anything to do with anyone here, nor do I particularly
want the information.)
I would really *hate* to be held accountable for this kind of activity.  I am
paranoid that I will be.  _Please_ do your exploring in other places and if
you do do it here, _don't_take_or_move_stuff_!  And don't leave the coffee
maker on.  Please.
Thanks.

To:       *Tales Of Lust And Lechery From The BMC Front and Etc. (#1714)
Subject:  On a Tangent...

I don't know how seriously the above letter indicated Milo's
feelings, but I just felt like writing in cause the sentiment
sounded really damn familiar, hit really close to home, etc...

1. Depression is an Addiction.

   I used to live for a good foul mood, just to make everyone
   else's day a little darker... and I've kind of gotten away
   from that in the last, oh, year or so.

2. Withdrawal is Hell.

   One day, you start getting over it, and find you can't stay
   depressed and pissed like you used to. Since you're addicted,
   this has a natural tendency to depress you and piss you off.
   But you can't stay depressed and pissed off, so you're lost
   in this wierd sort of fourth dimensional depression, trying
   your best to stay depressed, looking for reasons, and finding
   all kinds of rational reasons you *could* be depressed, but
   you just aren't, for some reason.

3. Recovery is Cool.

   Once you start realizing you can live without depression
   (heh), that wierd emotional limbo starts to break down,
   leaving all kinds of holes for other stuff, like having
   a real life of sorts. This "Real Life" stuff is still a
   relatively new experience for me, so further comment would
   be difficult, but it suffices to say that as with any good
   addiction you can be at least as happy without it as you
   can with it. You just can't quit cold turkey.

4. There is no 'Cure All.'

   Getting laid doesn't do it. Drinking doesn't do it. Drugs
   don't do it. It's too easy to replace one addiction with
   another. Once recovery starts, it kind of tends to snowball
   on it's own. Messing with the progression, possibly with the
   intent of speeding things up, may have adverse effects. See
   your physician <grin>.

5. Be Prepared for Backsliding.

   Since everyone gets depressed from time to time, over plenty
   of legitimate reasons, you will, too. Be ready for it, because
   for a recovering depression addict, it can be bad.
   Fortunately, spells tend to be short, and shorten as recovery
   progresses.

6. What Helps?

   Friends help. Good friends. And as you recover, you find
   friends pop up unexpectedly, in some of the strangest
   places and times. You'll find it's easier to get friends
   once you start having some fun and not bitching about
   your problems all the time. People who bitch a lot are not
   fun to be around, and generally don't have or easily keep
   friends. Remember that friends can make you happy, but they
   don't have to be intimately familiar with all your problems
   in order to do so. They'll make you a lot happier through
   just having fun with them than they will by sympathizing and
   commiseration.

6. The Bottom Line.

   Pain is nature's way of telling us something is wrong. Depression
   is psychological pain. Relishing in this pain is a form of
   masochism, generally accepted to be not healthy, since it
   leads to your doing things not in your own best interests.
   Once you start recovering, many of the horrible things that
   seemed so earth shattering previously will not matter as
   much, or won't happen at all, since a lot of the horrible
   things, you will find, you subconsciously caused all by your
   little ol' self.

Okay, I know this isn't the right list for this sort of thing.
And I'm not a professional psychologist. Hell, I'm not a
professional *anything*. I just found out recently that
'Freud' didn't rhyme with 'rude'. So take everything with a
shaker of salt. Also, I know this sounds like a real crock,
and that's what I would have thought if this wasn't my own
experience from the last year or so talking. I also don't know
if this is what Milo specifically is feeling, but the letter
seemed to hint at that. This is really more an open letter,
prompted by a connection in my own mind, whether one actually
exists or not. Finally I apologise to those of you to whom
this sounds really silly and pointless. I can see where it
seems that way, but unless I'm completely different from
everyone else in the universe, it happens. And I hope it helps
someone or a few someones.

Shutting up now...
====CF.

P.S. I think I see your problem, Milo. You were trying to say
     BMCers were not worthy of being singled out as really cool
     people in general, when in actuality, they *are* generally
     really cool people, worthy of a measure of attention anyway,
     if not 'praise'. <grin> Besides, this is a BMC sort of MOO...

Subject:  Alas, it comes.
Reply-to: *Theme-Issues (#120)

I've only got a few more days here before I lose access for what may be the
whole summer. That really sucks. But it's a good time for reflection.

At approximately one a.m. on November ninth, OpalMOO was started for the first
time. It was a mad frenzy of random building and topologically absurd
undescribed rooms all linked together off of what is now The Hallway (#11).
Opal and Triptych and I wandered around this empty place and tried to think
what it would be like once it started to become really groovy. We hadn't
expected things would grow so large; OpalMOO was started as a place for Opal
and me, some sort of weird romantic gift, but we couldn't let it go without
inviting people to it, and... you know how these things go.

Hell, we didn't even know if it -would- get to be really groovy. Until
November 23, when we got the official OK to let it run `as long as system
resources permit.' By this time, we had approximately twenty-five players on
the MOO, and we were approaching object #400.

The growth of OpalMOO was assisted by the exodus from LambdaMOO. Even being
freed from the allegedly oppressive rule of the wizards didn't save us; people
fled to what were the OrbitMOOs, which (if I recall properly) were OpalMOO,
JaysHouseMOO, FinalFrontierMOO, and PlayHouseMOO. (Presently, only two
survive: OpalMOO, and JaysHouseMOO.)

We evolved quickly, using a new `@examine' protocol, corifying the use of the
:contents verb, and using various hacks for features and other parsing stuff.
We were evolving quickly and things started to get really weird.

Praecox and Greene asked if they could design drugs. I said sure, and they
bullied me into designing multiple-ownership for the MOO; this is one of the
totally neat parts of OpalCore. (I really wish it were finished, but that's
another matter entirely.)

And now, we're sitting here with a constantly evolving core (a core, by the
way, which proves to me what I'd suspected: if programmers are given an
environment which encourages them to be innovative, amazing and wonderful
things will come of it) and a brand new wizard.

So I get to leave for the summer. I'm not worried; the place is in capable
hands. But I felt the need to say, before I go back to New Jersey, that I am
really looking forward to coming back to OpalMOO and seeing what's happened in
the next few months. And when November ninth rolls around again, let's see
what we can show for our first year. (Who knows -- maybe OpalCore will be in
greater use than LambdaCore!)

Take care, y'all. I love ya. Have fun. (And good luck, Edison!)

I thought it was a quiet moo _with_ the BMC crowd.
Why, by the way, or since you mention it, to be absolutely, and consciously
of course, parenthetic, is the bell tower several minutes late?
Just to maintain themeliness, or is Opal now set just a bit in the past?
August?  Hmmm, the only nice thing about August is that it is closer to
winter than May is.  (Okay, not the ONLY thing, sheesh!  You people
are so literal.)
So...with the BMC crowd, as you put it, Korvac, gone, what to do with *BMC?
What to do...?  Of course, since Yas won't be on for a while, I can
make outrageous suggestions on credit, as it were.  I wonder what her
interest rate is?  Anyway, suggestions anyone?  How about making truly
tasteless puns here?  Or absolutely hideous creative writing?
Irrelevant political commentary?
Maybe we could make really scathing reviews of books, music, and theater/
movies...`Carson McCullers--more fun than a jar full of hungry dog ticks...'
`Guns n Roses--These purported musicians have as much relation to music
as Edward Teller has to the Nobel peace prize...'
Hmmm.  Could be...diverting.  Yup.

Subject:  Why an appendectomy is more fun than having your eyes gnawed out by rabid stoats:

Well.
First off, I'd like to cordially agree with Milo, Panda, Korvac, and Opal.
You might ask why, or, if you are somewhat more rational, what I am agreeing
with.  I answer: I don't know.  But it's a Tradition.
Recommended book: Nadine Gordimer's "July's People."  Scary and fun, but her
writing style is sorta annoying.
Anyone out there read "The Handmaid's Tale"?  I'm annoyed at Atwood right now
and would love to discuss that book with people.
Also, if anyone can come up with a non-gratuitous pun using the word "Opal"
I'd be interested to hear it.  I've tried and come up with some typically vile
and not-worth-posting stuff...

At any rate, I know, I know I'm not at BMC, but I'm still here for the summer

Well, *I* don't.  First off, I think we should start oppressing people who
drive cars.  Secondly, so the court overthrew Amendment 2 in Colorado.  What's
the big deal?
If it's unconstitutional, people can't vote it in.  They have to change the
constitution.  Don't these morons get it?
Whether it is constitutional or not, I don't have the guts or the knowledge to
say.  However, if everyone voted to take all them dirty (insert generic racial
slur here) and line 'em up and shoot 'em, I would HOPE that the court would
overturn the law.
But these idiots are out raving about "We voted for it and the courts just
nullified our votes!"  Well, gee.  And it's not like Amendment 2 didn't

Re: 156
  I didn't realize how prevalent homophobia was out here until last night,
when A) my boy pointed out to me that half of everyone I meet voted yes on
Amendment 2 and B) I met this schizophrenic Christian at work who talked to me
for three hours about his problems with looking at girls and (earlier that
evening) men.
He apparently thought I was a bartender.  The conversation started off with
him asking, "Are you a Christian?"  Never in my life have I had a good
conversation that started that way.  I wrangled my way around that one in such
I way that I said no and he heard yes.  Yasminda the verbal stunt pilot.  He
had a friend with him who just listened to the entire conversation, which I
thought was weird.
He wanted to be enlightened, which I don't think you can order at Denny's.  He
had had some "feelings" for a guy friend of his - he was worried about
dishonoring his parents because they didn't like this guy, he was worried
about being a homosexual, although I think he would have gagged rather than
say the word.  He was sitting there with a red leather bound red letter Bible
and reading things aloud to me and asking me what I thought God meant by that.
Let me state at this time that I look nothing like a priest, or a minister, or
a pastor or even a choir boy.  Especially not in my uniform.  And I am also a
person who feels like throwing up upon hearing of someone persuing organized
religion.  It always seemed odd to me to try to enlighten/save your own soul
by listening to someone else tell you what God wants.
Grf.  I babbled at him.  You can't blow off people who are sincerely hurtin
without getting guilty later, anyway.  I gave him a handful of smatterings og
religions (everything from Islamic Pillars to Franny and Zooey and the Jesus
Prayer) and told him that since God is hopefully always trying to make people
learn, maybe God was trying to make him sympathize with homosexuals andlet him
see how they felt.
He didn't like that At All.  Not one bit.  he told me God was punishing him
for being bad in looking at girls.  That's where all my reasoning goes to
muck, because if he's going to believe in a petty God, I can't make his brain
bigger.  Anybody know what I should say to him when he comes in again (because
he will, he's a regular and I'm a nice respectable girl), because I'm at a
loss?
Anyway, the point of this is, Amendment 2 *is* unconstitution from this
standpoint, since it denies a minority its rights under the 14th amendment
(that's the same one that kept Jim Crow laws and slavery until cases were won
in the Supreme Court, and the people who voted it in are really pathetic and
maddening.
A wonderful fact about American law/history:  You can vote anything into law,
despite constitutionality.  It's the courts' job to make sure that the law IS
constitutional.  A lot of the time, especially in controversial cases, the
courtrts decide to put off debating whether the law is constitutional or not
until a group of pissed off people take another group of equally pissed off
people to the Supreme Court.
So, you could pass a law to take all the (generic term) out and shoot them (or
put them in concentration camps, see Executive order 45801 which put all the
Japanese Americans into camps during WWII for details, or the ones which threw
the Indians off their land), but only if you had a really active court would
you get it knocked down without a court hearing.  My cynical bet would be that
once word got out, they would wait for someone to make a case.

One of the primary purposes of the court system is to balance the system, act
as an inertial damper against pressure from the exec, congress, and the
public.  Which is why a somewhat slow court system is actually good.  (and, in
my humble opinion, the courts need to be stronger, especially in light of the
massive growth of the executive
system of late, since Nixon.  It's been too weak since FDR but the disparity
has grown a LOT in the last 20 years.)
In cases like the Nisei internment, this didn't work, and it's not working in
the Haiti cases, either.  Or, for that matter, in a number of illegal DEA
seizures that Reagan encouraged.
However, those are, I hope, temporary and unusual problems.  Any law enacted
by any group is subject to judicial review, which is why we need to keep our
eyes open.  It took some fantastic arguing to get breathalyzer test evidence
admitted as evidence, as it seemed to contradict the right to not testify
against oneself.
My primary complaint here is that most people have no idea of this system and
are incensed that the court can overturn this.
By the way, I'd say, in defense of Coloradoans, that a lot of people here are
homophobic but are perfectly willing to let people do whatever they want to,
and that it was the selling of the law as "No special rights" that got it
passed.
At least that's what I hope.

Life affirming thing!  Goodness in people is not yet dead thing!
Last night a very drunk boy (and this, my friends who see me call 85-year-old
people with penises "boys", was a boy - I would put him at 15 or 16 or even
younger) came into the midnight palace of fun and smoke to meet a group of
nine obnoxious friends of his.  The big group left in little clumps until
finally all  that was left were these two guys and this one very drunk person.
The very drunk person waved bye and headed out to his car.
The two guys sitting at the table assured me that they were not walking out on
me, asked me to call the police if they came in and asked me to, and ran out
after this guy.  They tackled him, got his keys, brought him back inside, and
gave his keys to me (and I promptly dumped them on the cook).
This was about midnight.  The two guys sat there with the drunk guy, taking
him to the bathroom so he could puke and making sure he had coffee to drink,
until about four in the morning (which was when he could run in a straight
line and remember what his name was and apologize to me for asking when I got
laid if I worked nights).  The two guys who were with him had only met him
that night; they just didn't want him driving home drunk.
I don't know *why* I'm taking up so much space with this except to say that
there *are* nice people in the world and it does my cynic heart good to se it

Have you considered the possibility that for this particular establishment in
which you labor, sales totals might be a function of tip totals +- a constant?
i.e.:

t^x + c = S

where t=tips, ^x is the power that figure is raised to, and c is a constant
that acts as a `slop faactor' of sorts?

To the charge that folks at Denny's only leave what they want onna table, and
that they would never fathom an equation in even 1 teensy variable, I can
offer no defense, other than that in a deterministic universe, those poor
ungifted patrons need not have the faintest inkling that they are fulfilling
some set of predestined conditions.  Even though billiard balls on a pool
table cannot comprehend Newtonian physics, they none the less respond in an
entirely predictable fashion when whacked with a cue...
And since one would be rather hard pressed to disprove conclusively that our
universe, or at least the one inside Denny's, is not deterministic in nature,
the possibility that those blokes are actually behaving according to some
general principle cannot be discounted completely.

Syl, do you mean to insinuate that BMC has tunnels connecting buildings?
This is a fascinating possibility.  UMBC has a network of large tunnels
(you can drive a jeep through 'em!) that connect almost all the buildings
on campus.  I have no idea how extensive they are; I wonder if some brave
and foolish spelunker will some day find a link betweenthe UMBC and BMC
systems?  ;)  Just a thought...


BTW, I do rather enjoy fishing.  Fly casting, to be precise; using cut or live
bait is too easy.  Sitting down and tying a tuft of fur and feathers onto a
bare hook, then throwing it out to bob on the water like so much flotsam,
nad -then- convincing a trout to believe that bit of dander riding the surface
tension is actually an edible food item-- THAT is a bit more challenging.  :)

Subject:  a box of rain

   I have a story to tell.  A long time ago, the gods gave a bride a dowry
of magnificent spendour.  It was an exquisitely carved chest, inlaid with
gold and gemstones.  It was given with the instruction that it must never
be opened, as the direst of misfortune would befall humanity if it were!
   On their wedding night, however, the blissful couple could not resist any
longer though, and they opened the chest.  Lo and behold, what happened next
has laid the heaviest yoke upon humanity-- one that I fear it will never be
strong enough to throw off.  Out of the box there rose a great rustling wind,
and on it rode all the woes and evils that we know today, free to range over
the earth and visit misery upon everyone for all future time...
   However, not everything left the box.  There, at the bottom of the chest,
the man and woman found, nestled in the corner, one thing.  It had stayed for
them, as the gods had told it to.  And seeing this, the man and woman took up
this thing to their bosom, and gave it shelter in their heart, where it
resides to this day.  And all the descendants of those two cherish this thing
above all other feelings, and thus will never be free of its curse.
   The thing that waited for them on the floor of the chest was, of course,
Hope.  And the gods wanted us to cherish Hope above all other things--
because Hope, the only burden on humanity so heavy it could not lift itself
from the prison the gods had laid it in, is the one thing that makes humans
want to stay here and bear the suffering brought on them by the rest of the
contents of that cursed box.

Does anyone have any suggestions for what to cover white (Well, blotchy,

Maybe I could get a bunch of car doors from a salvage yard...
Anyway, suggestions?  Anyone?

Try mixing up a solution of nutrient agar or fruit pectin and spraying it onna
walls.  Then get lots of chia seeds from your local organic grocer. (Fescue or
bluegrass will do in a pinch, but it gets too big and needs mowed.)  Invite
some friends over and throw a wall-seeding party.  Just wet the wall down
again with a spray bottle, and throw the seed at it.  They'll stick.  Keep 'em
wet fer a week or so with that spray bottle, and soon you'll have a Chia Wall!

It'd look REALLY cool, especially when they mass-spore.

Just because I am in a happier mood and am hiding from the humidity in the
air-conditioned computer lab of the PSB, you all understand.
now, BMC outlaws pets, BUT it apparently allows pets that fit inside 2-gallon
(whatever that measurement is) aquariums.  (One of the dorm's co-prezes has a
rat.)  So I was wondering, in the spirit of, 'I'm back at college, anybody
have any suggestions on what I should do....?' if anybody had any ideas on
what kind of a pet Sylvia and I could have in our collective rooms in a
2-whatever aquarium.
This makes me think that when we had Merkin in a rat cage, he probably would
have fit the requirements of the 2-whatever size, even if he wasn't happy
being in a position like that.

Hm.  You could actually fit a medium-size dog in a two-gallon aquarium, but
you'd need a blender to do it.  And the doggie would not be good for much more
than chum after that.  Those of you who do salt-water fishing, especially for
bluefish (yuk) know what I'm talking about.

However, since a dog that cannot catch tennis balls is not much fun, I'd
suggest, (surprise surprise) a snake.  A rainbow boa would be ideal; they stay
comparatively small, not more than 5 feet tops, and they are very sociable.
They are quiet, only eat once a week, clean, don't leave hair all over the
place, and they are hypo-allergenic to boot!  They also are great if you do
not have a lot of time lavishing attention on them.  They don't mind if you
blow them off for a week to visit an SO, as long as they are fed and watered
before you leave...
..and you already know where to get one meal for them if you are in a bind
and cannot get ot to the pet store!  (Although the dorm supervisor might
resist surrendering that rodent!)

Equal treatment of all letters.   You were talking about the English language.
Here's a thought:  all languages can be broken down into  basic sounds, as BMC
goes out of the way to point out to its Russian classes.  Now, in English,
there are god-knows-how-many basic sounds, because English has funky little
things like silent letters and  two letters to make one sound (ghoti,
anyone?).  Russian has 38 basic sounds, and only two of the letters are not
really  pronounced, because they get to tell you how to pronounce the one
before it.
The point being,  maybe it's your silly language that's being discriminating
(and yes, it's MY silly language too, but not by choice) by not only utilizing
"minority" letters, but by taking away individual sounds and voicings.

Subject:  Life, the universe, and the meaning of SPAM.

I have it on the highest authority (John Cleese and Terry Gilliam) that SPAM
is more than just chemicals.  Some thing that does not fall into the vegetable
or mineral categories actually had to be killed and rendered unidentifiable
as its original form in order to make SPAM.  The chemicals are just colouring
and binding agents.
In the late 1970's and early 80's, the Great Nauga was driven to the brink of
extinction by overharvesting.  In 1987, the Nauga was added to appendix 2 of
the CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) treaty,
and now is making a comeback thanks to the protection it enjoys.  However,
there is a dark note to this environmental success story.  Every year, several
hundred Nauga disappear from game preserves and national parks.  No trace of
them is ever found.  It is suspected that the disappearances are the work of
hide poachers, but thus far none have been apprehended.  If indeed it is the
illegal Naugahide trade that is responible for these disappearances, why is
it that park rangers find no denuded carcasses?  Poachers take with them only
what they can profitably sell, and the risk of toting about a dead animal the
size of a large sofa is quite considerable.  It's hard to look nonchalant as
park personnel pass by when you're lugging even a covered Nauga around.

Add to these facts the decline in demand for Naugahide products (thanks to
massive "Save the Nauga" ad campaigns in the late 1980's), and it becomes
immediately evident that something far more sinister is at work here.  Who is
buying out these magestic creatures?  And for what purpose?  Just something
for you, the home viewer, to think about, the next time you are pushing a
shopping cart down the canned meats aisle at your neighborhood grocer...

I'm glad to know that someone's finally pursuing the Nauga Connection.
Ollie North said he was just following instructions, when the Senate asked him
about it, you know.
And, of course, there are all those stories about the Freedom Fighters
training poor innocent Naugas as attack Naugas, using conventional attack
training techniques, including electroshock therapy.
(Which is why there's a brisk business in spotted/mottled Naugahide.)
My theory is this: They're trained to swim from ships off-shore, outside the
three-mile limit, with huge backpacks and panniers strapped to them, filled
with drugs and ammunition, so that they can escape radar.  Once they've
accomplished this, they're unceremoniously killed.
Then they're processed and sold as Spam.  There have even been unconfirmed
reports that they're being taught, like dolphins once were, to seek out ships,
while carrying high explosives.
And unlike dolphins, a full-grown male Nauga is about the size of a Chevette
that's been rolled, so you can stack a LOT of C-4 on one of them.
Keep it in mind.  Write a letter to your senator or Dee Dee Myers.
The conspiracy must not be allowed to continue.

Now, I have only seen one picture of Seth, but he looked to _me_
like a combination of a psychotic fencer (epee or sabre?) and a
moody young artist considering philosophies of toe-nail trimming.
Neither of these images are even close to being cute, fuzzy fluffy, or
hideously stuffed-bear like.
Or perhaps he looked, as D.Adams said, like a preying mantis who has
given up preying and taken up tennis.
But, as I said, I only saw a picture.

English, as in Standard American English, (a very limited definition, I know.)
can be represented by 23 phonemes.
These are, in a sort of IPA order, b,p,m,v,f,voiced th (thy),unvoiced th
(thigh),d,t,z,s,dzh (well, this is a symbol that doesn't translate well, but
seen in the word Gin),tS (again, bad trans., think CHin),n,l,r,zh (as in
aZure),S (as in aSHes), j (as in Yet, weird, I know.), g,k,ng (riNG) and w.
Not too bad!
What I think is interesting and a bit unusual is that the letter "c" is
entirely unneccessary as a stand-alone.  (Circus is written SirKus)  However,
if we deleted it, we'd lose the ch sound.  Very odd.

The neglect of vowel phonemes in the last few postings, or in printed text,
does little to affect the comprehension of the language.  English is still
usable without vowels, at least in printed form.  Try it for yourself.  Take
a given tract ot text,and delete all the vowels.  It's still understandable.
Now remove all the consonants.  Not worth reading, is it?  Vowels, for the
most part, are merely representative of the tones that allow us to string
consonants together smoothly.  Vowels are only necessary in a spoken language.

They could.  But it'd be redundant.
We use one set of letters, th, for both the voiced and unvoiced, and the same
holds with j and ch.  (this being the dzh in Gin, not the unused j as in
join.)
So why not drop it entirely, or create a letter that could stand for either
depending on context, a la the Old English Th?
Likewise, the difference between s and z is entirely arbitrary.  Either
separate them or consolidate them, I say.

Unclean undies might not be too bad.  Kinda like dying with your boots on, but
not quite as kinky.  :)

The "little death," my little cabbage, is usually easiest without undies,
unless you buy those tacky icky things from Fredrick's of Hollywood.  So

I'll give this subject wide berth, (fifth amendment) and merely say that *I*
want to be shot dead by a jealous wife on my ninety fifth birthday.
Either that or get shot while leading a pro-choice rally and get reincarnated
as one of the movie cameras they use to make a film about my murder.  That'd
be cool.
