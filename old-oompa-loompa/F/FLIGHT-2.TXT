&LAND-1 Flightpack Prototype=$land:@remit [loc(owner(me))]=%N presses a button, and the mini-rockets start powering down. As they do so, %N lands on %p feet safely.
&RETRACT-2 Flightpack Prototype=$rrec:@remit loc(owner(me))=%N pushes a button on the control arm, and you see the mini-rockets on the flightpack retract.
&EXTEND-2 Flightpack Prototype=$rext:@remit loc(owner(me))=%N pushes a button on the control arm, and you see mini-rockets extend from either side of the flightpack.
&RETRACT-1 Flightpack Prototype=$retract:@remit loc(owner(me))=%N presses a button on the control arm of his flightpack, and the wings retract back into the flightpack.
&EXTEND-1 Flightpack Prototype=$extend:@remit loc(owner(me))=%N presses a button on the control arm of his flightpack, and wings extend out.
@DESCRIBE Flightpack Prototype=This is a design of what will hopefully become a IC flightpack.
&AIM-1 Flightpack Prototype=$aim *:@pemit %#=You aim your laser at [name(*%0)].;@remit loc(owner(me))=%N aims a unfamiliar laser at [name(*%0)].

&FIRE-1 Flightpack Prototype=$fire *:@pemit %#=You stun [name(*%0)] with your laser!;@remit loc(owner(me))=%N stuns [name(*%0)] with the unfamiliar laser.
&HOVER-1 Flightpack Prototype=$hover:@remit loc(owner(me))=%N presses a button, and 2 mini-rockets extend out. They fire, putting him about 20 feet in the air, then holding him there.
&WHEREIS-1 Flightpack Prototype=$where *:@pemit %N=[name(*%0)] is currently at: [name(loc(*%0))] - <[loc(*%0)]>
