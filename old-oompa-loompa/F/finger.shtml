<center><h2>Configurable +Finger System</h2></center>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

This system allows you to set up your own +finger command in minutes, simply by choosing a list of finger fields to display.  You have a great deal of freedom in the appearance of the +finger information. 

<h3>Features</h3>
<P>There are three possible sections in +finger you can use:  Top, Middle, and Bottom.  The Middle area is further divided into Left and Right.  So, if you used all the sections, your +finger display would look like:
<BR><BR>
<TABLE border=1>
<TR><TD colspan=2><CENTER>TOP</CENTER>
<TR><TD>LEFT<TD>RIGHT
<TR><TD colspan=2><CENTER>BOTTOM</CENTER>
</TABLE>

<P>You can have other combinations, too:
<BR><BR>
<TABLE border=1>
<TR><TD colspan=2><CENTER>TOP</CENTER>
<TR><TD colspan=2><CENTER>BOTTOM</CENTER>
</TABLE>

<p>or:

<BR><BR>
<TABLE border=1>
<TR><TD>LEFT<TD>RIGHT
<TR><TD colspan=2><CENTER>BOTTOM</CENTER>
</TABLE>

<P>or even just:

<BR><BR>
<TABLE border=1>
<TR><TD colspan=2><CENTER>TOP</CENTER>
</TABLE>

<h3>Fields</h3>
<P>You choose which finger fields (name, race, age, etc.) get displayed in each section.  If you choose no fields in a given section, it will not appear at all (so to get the third example, you would leave your "top fields" attribute empty.

<P>A number of default fields come with the system (these are listed and explained below), but you can modify them and create whatever new ones you desire.  For example, their is no "Rank" field currently but you can create one.  Similarly, the "Age" field assumes that its data is stored in a dedicated AGE attribute, but if you store your age somewhere else (like in a PROFILE attribute along with hair color, eye color, etc.) you can edit the age field function to grab its data from PROFILE instead.

<h3>Security</h3>
<a name="security">
<P>Many folks are concerned about security in +finger, and with older versions of PennMUSH (or with TinyMUX) it is a valid paranoia.  To choose your security level, you choose wehther to allow function evaluations in Notes, Background, and Concept +finger fields and allow players to use ansi, linebreaks, and other highly useful formatting functions.

<h4>Player Customization</h4>
<P>Most fields will not show up at all if they player does not have them set (exceptions are general fields that apply to all players, like Name, Sex, and Status).  This allows the players to customize the appearance of their own finger information to some extent.  Perhaps Player1 wants to put all his custom info in a single "notes" field, but Player2 wishes to use Background, Concept, and Notes.  It also prevents things like "Awards: None" from showing up, which seems to annoy some folks (I don't quite understand why).
<P>Note that players cannot choose fields which the admin not enabled.  If you don't set up the system with the Race field, it doesn't matter if the player sets a RACE attribute on himself.

<P><HR><P>

<h3>Platform</h3>

<P>This code is designed for PennMUSH only.  As long as PennMUSH stays backwards compatible, it will work on version 1.7.2 patchlevel 19 or higher.  You're welcome to try it on older versions of Penn, or on TinyMUX, but I make no guarantees that it will work.

  ** This appearance requires some modifications from the default field settings
     but is very easy to accomplish.  Just add %B's after the field titles to make
     the fields line up right, and edit the bottom fields to all have a %R at the
     beginning.
