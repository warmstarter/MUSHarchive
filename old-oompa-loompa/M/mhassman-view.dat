DESC=+view allows you to have "virtual objects" in your rooms -- objects that  can be looked at and respond with the equivalent of Desc, Odesc, and  Adesc, but cannot be picked up. This allows you to put more detail into  your rooms without needing to create a lot of extraneous objects.  NOTE: This program requires an unformatter utility.
