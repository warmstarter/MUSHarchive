@DESCRIBE MultiVendor=This is a vendor that sells multiple objects. To buy something, [ansi(h,ORDER <ITEM>)], where <ITEM> is one of [u(#1838/enumerate,u(#1838/capitalize,v(items)),,or)], and then give the vendor the requested amount of money ([ansi(h,GIVE MULTIVENDOR=<N>)]).%r%rSince this is an example object, it doesn't actually create objects, but it's easy to make your own copy do so. See [ansi(g,MultiVendor/Notes)] for information. It's visual, so you can copy the code to other mushes. Feel free to modify it as needed. Enjoy. -- Raevnos

&NOTES MultiVendor=To make your own: @create an object, @parent it to #3496, @set it=!no_command, and @cpattr #3496/startup=<dbref of your object>. The order command uses semaphores so that only one person can order at a time. It clears itself after 60 seconds, or the first time it's given enough money, and moves onto the next order in the queue, or waits for one to show up.%r%rThe attribute ITEMS contains a list of items the vendor sells (One word names only, though you can modify that fairly easily), and for each item, the attribute <ITEM>_COST is how much it costs, in MUSH Money, and the attribute <ITEM>_BUY contains code that's @triggered when it's bought, with the dbref of the buyer in \%0.%r%r\%1 contains the name of the current item being bought.
