Javelin's "MUSH Combat System", used on Belgariad MUSH. This is really old
code and may no longer work - use it for ideas and inspiration.
If you base your combat system on this code or its algorithms or
ideas, please add a line of credit for the idea to Javelin@Belgariad
in your combat +help or news text.

The MCS is an attack-only system. Attacker attacks, and the result
depends on stats and chance.
