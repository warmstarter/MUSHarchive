You are in the luxurious room of the administration hallway. The place where the Theme Director and the Role-Playing Council works all night and day to make what's presentable, or at least what they think is presentable. In the middle of the room is a long conference table where the members of the RPC and the Theme Director sit about thinking, arguing, and planning. Towards the back are several computers on desks with coffee cigars and candy wraps strewn about. Piles of paper are stacking high, and all about. Comfortable chairs are all around the computers. Towards the front of the room is a replicator and to the left of that, is a giant jukebox. And next to that is a giant pop machine from the 1950s and a old candy machine next to it.
