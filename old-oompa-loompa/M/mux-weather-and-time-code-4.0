Keran's MUSH/MUX Weather and Time Code Package Version 4.0 beta
MUX Code and Installation Instructions

This code and accompanying materials are copyright (C) 1996, 1997,
1998 by Keran (keranset@mail1.nai.net).
You can do anything with this code except sell it or claim credit for
the parts I wrote. Use at your own risk, and all that.

This code will run on TinyMUX 1.4 and 1.6. (It may run on earlier
releases as is, but I haven't tried it.) It shouldn't be run on 1.5
(which is a beta) because memory leaks will cause your process size
to increase continually if the weather and time code is running.
Upgrade to 1.6 and then run it.

A preliminary look at TinyMUSH 3.0 suggests that this code is
likely to run without alteration on it.

The latest version of this code is running at Keranset Island,
telmaron.telmaron.com 5252.

Features:

Time functions for determining the year, month, season, time of day,
 tide, and moon phase; 
A weathermaker that determines a different weather type every day; 
Day and night length that vary by season. The length of the longest
 day can be set by hours or by latitude;
A weather description bank with descriptions that vary by time of day
 and season; 
A collection of outdoor parent rooms that make it easy to write
 descriptions that vary by time of day, season, weather, and the
 visibility of the moon, in different styles;
Indoor parent rooms for writing descriptions that vary with lighting
 conditions and the visual capability of the viewer;
A parent room hierarchy that means you can write your own parent rooms
 and easily have them recognized as the correct type of room.
Configurable time compression ratios, in two different modes. You can
 accelerate all time with clock compression, or skip days with
 calendar compression; 
Simple adjustable weather modelling; 
An optional quasi-Gregorian calendar in addition to the native
 calendar, and an option for taking the date from the system clock
 in 1:1 time; 
Clock code that can send out messages to specified receivers at given
 times, such as sunrise, moonset, other time of day transitions, tide
 changes, at specific hours, every hour, every half hour, or every
 quarter hour.
An auxiliary bank of descriptions varying by season, time of day, and
 weather, geared to surroundings with a lot of leafy trees, to
 illustrate how to make auxiliary desc banks for different
 environments; 
Regional weather, and a sample slave weather station.
A fairly realistic moon; 
Diurnal or semi-diurnal tides synchronized with the moon;
A Storm Maker that can be used to do global, area, and room type emits
 to allow the production of storms, earthquakes, blackouts, etc.
A test room for ensuring that the whole thing works.
The code is intended to be readable and adjustable by a competent
 coder, allowing it to be set up in numerous non-vanilla ways, which
 are discussed at some length in the configuration section of the
 +help.


Changes between 3.0 and 4.0:

-- The Time Functions object was too big in 3.0, and it would have been
staggering with the 4.0 moon on it. The moon and tide functions now have
an object all to themselves. Miscellaneous functions and weather desc
functions now also reside on a separate object.

-- The Emits Bank now sends its sunrise, sunset, time of day, etc.,
messages to rooms on which &hear-weather-emits=1, as opposed to
&hear-global-emits. It will also send tide emits to rooms on which 
&hear-tide-emits=1.

-- There are new times at which the Clock can trigger events.
Meridian-transit is when the moon reaches its zenith. It can also
trigger events every hour without your needing to specify the hours,
every half-hour, or every quarter-hour.

-- There's a new command on the Wizard Weather and Time Commands object
to allow you to compute the length of the longest day by giving a
latitude.

-- The moon's behavior is now astronomically sane. The tides are
synchronized with the moon.

-- There's a Storm Maker that can be used to changed the day's weather
and can broadcast effects messages to selected groups of rooms, making
it possible to generate local storms, earthquakes, etc.

-- There is now a system clock calendar mode. If you're going to run
in 1:1 and you want to run off the system clock and get a 365-day year
complete with dates, and stay in synchronization with the real year,
you can.

-- There is a hierarchy of parent rooms, including indoor rooms with
lighting variations, and several more outdoor parent rooms. This works
in conjunction with the Storm Maker; you can add your own parent rooms
to it.

-- The +help has been reorganized drastically. It may not be any
clearer, but it's at least different. There are now three sections to
the +help, general, admin commands, and configuration. I have, I hope,
located the information builders need once the code has been installed
in general +help instead of burying it in the config section.

-- Bug fixes will be noted in the changes.txt file in the same ftp
directory I distribute the code from.


For this installation, you need to be a wizard.

There are three global functions which are best loaded on #1; God
needs to set this up. However, if necessary, you may also load
globals on any wiz-inherit item whose dbref is lower than the dbref
of anything that needs to call weather and time code.

You need a configuration change to the server. Function_invocation_limit
should be set to approximately 12,500. No, that is not a typo. And, no,
it's highly unlikely to bring your server to its knees. CPUs improve
every year, and most games can easily handle this code; it's possible
that on a large and very heavily loaded server that this could cause
difficulties, but generally speaking you won't even notice this config
change. The reason it's required is that the set of functions invoked
when the variable-desc Parent Rooms include calls for a moon desc is
extremely large; the 4.0 moon is complex. +today may also fail to
function correctly if the function invocation limit is not high enough.

If you don't know /anything/ about code, don't attempt this. Get a
code wiz. You don't need to be a psychocoder to install it, but you
really should have at least passing familiarity with the basics of
how code works.

The procedure for installing this code involves:

-- Creating the items.
-- Editing the code section of this text file to replace my dbrefs
  with yours.
-- Loading the attributes onto the individual items.
-- Putting Keran's Global Command Object in the Master Room.
-- Putting everything else in the box in your Auxiliary Room.
-- Adding global function loads to #1.
-- Adding the +help entry point to your own +help.
-- Reconfiguring the server's function_invocation_limit.
-- @triggering the Clock. 
-- Deciding what configuration you want and setting it up.

*       *       *

There are too many items to make @editing tolerable. It's easier to
edit the text file. Begin by creating the following and noting the
item numbers.

@create Keran's Time Functions
@create Keran's Tree Weather Descriptions
@create Keran's Weather Long Description Bank

Now do a search-and-replace on all the text in the code section
below. Search for the database reference numbers in my item list
farther up the page, and replace with the dbrefs of the corresponding
items you just created. Upload the code itself item by item from the
code section.

A caution: it may happen that one of your objects may turn out to
have the same dbref as a /different/ one of my objects. In that
case, the order in which you execute the search-and-replace
operations is important. If, for example, one of your objects
turns out to be numbered #115, and it isn't the Clock, you'll
need to do the search-and-replace for the Clock in the code
section before you do the search-and-replace for whatever object
came out numbered #115, because if you do the Clock replace
afterward, all the references to the Clock and all the references
to whatever object is your #115 will end up pointing to the Clock.

What to do if you're upgrading from 3.0:
There are various approaches, depending on what you've done with 3.0
If you've done significant amounts of custom coding or complex setup,
you very probably want to do a new installation of 4.0 and leave 3.0
working as is, then port your changes to 4.0 gradually; after that, you
can do a brute-force database edit to fix dbrefs. (Note to TinyMUSH dev
team: what I really want is RCS for softcode. <grinning, ducking, and
running>)

If you have a 3.0 setup with no significant dependent code or building,
you can do a new 4.0 installation and simply discard the 3.0 stuff.

A common case will be to have nothing particularly unusual in the setup
--no recoding, no complex regional weather, etc.--but to have code or
building that calls 3.0 functions by dbref--usually, this means
functions from the 3.0 Time Functions object--and possibly to have
rooms parented to the 3.0 Outdoor Parent Room. There are two approaches
you can take to this:

1) Erase the attributes from your 3.0 objects, and load the 4.0
attributes onto the corresponding objects; make the new 4.0 objects in
the usual way; then alter a couple of the 4.0 items so dependent code
can use some of the 3.0 references instead.

2) Ditto, but instead of altering any 4.0 items for 3.0 compatibility,
comb through your database with some editing code to switch all the
references to 4.0. This is more work up front; however, what you have
when you get done will be a pure 4.0 installation and you won't have
to contend with possible incompatibilities in bug fixes, add-ons,
documentation, etc.; it's also slightly more efficient.

Procedure:

@nuke the 3.0 +help items (Common function help, Uncommon function
help, Topics). They're expendable.

Your basic erase-the-objects procedure is easily done with @dolist
lattr(<3.0 item>)=&## <3.0 item>. Remember to include the Global
Command Object and the Outdoor Parent Room, which won't  be in the box
with the other stuff.

Rename the box to Keran's Box of Weather and Time Stuff, with Notes.
Rename the Outdoor Parent Room to Keran's Parent of Separable Day-Night
and Season Desc Outdoor Rooms. You can rename all the other 3.0 stuff
if you want; it won't hurt anything if you don't, but having all the
names start with 'Keran's' makes it easier to keep track of the parts
of the package.

Now @create all remaining items from 4.0. When you get done, you'll
have the 4.0 blank items, but the dbrefs of those 4.0 items that existed
in 3.0 will be the same as your 3.0 dbrefs in your new installation.
Search and replace the dbrefs in the code section below so they refer to
your items instead of mine, and upload the code onto your items.

For the edit-the-code approach:

        1) If you've set &hear-global-emits to 1 on significant numbers of
individual rooms, @edit the Emits bank so:
@edit Emits Bank/*=hear-weather-emits,hear-global-emits
Then replace &hear-weather-emits=1 on all the parent rooms with
&hear-global-emits=1.

        If you haven't individually set &hear-global-emits on many rooms,
skip this and change the attribute on the individual rooms from
&hear-global-emits=1 to &hear-weather-emits=1.

        2) Patch the Time Functions object so all the functions likely
to be called from it by external code in 3.0 can still be called from
it in 4.0, as follows:

&RANDWORD Time Functions=[extract(%0, add(1, rand(words(%0))), 1)]
&TILDE2BLANK Time Functions=[edit(v(0),~,%b)]
&BLANK2TILDE Time Functions=[edit(v(0),%b,~)]
&LONG-WEATHER Time Functions=[u(#26/[u(#7/season)][u(#7/day-night-dawn-dusk)][u(#111/weathertype)])]
&SHORT-WEATHER Time Functions=[u(#111/[u(#7/season)][u(#111/weathertype)])]
&TREE-WEATHER Time Functions=[u(#25/trees_[u(#7/season)]_[u(#7/day-night)]_[u(#111/weathertype)])]
&SLAVE-LONG-WEATHER Time Functions=[u(#26/[u(#7/season)][u(#7/day-night-dawn-dusk)][u(#114/slave-weathertype)])]
&SLAVE-SHORT-WEATHER Time Functions=[u(#111/[u(#7/season)][u(#114/slave-weathertype)])]
&SLAVE-TREE-WEATHER Time Functions=[u(#25/trees_[u(#7/season)]_[u(#7/day-night)]_[u(#114/slave-weathertype)])]
&WINDOW Time Functions=[lcstr(first(u(long-weather)))] [rest(u(long-weather))]
&MOON-ADJECTIVE Time Functions=[switch(u(moon-phase), new, black, waxing crescent, faint, first quarter, dim, waxing gibbous, bright, full, brilliant, waning gibbous, bright, last quarter, dim, waning crescent, faint)]
&MOON-PHASE Time Functions=[u(#555/moon-phase)]
&TIDE Time Functions=[u(#555/tide)]

Search and replace my dbrefs above with yours, naturally.

For the edit-the-database approach:

        Proceed with a normal 4.0 installation from here. Then edit the
database.

        Here follows code for doing mass edits that should catch most of
the differences between 3.0 and 4.0; it's possible that for given
installations, there may be other items you want to add to the list of
things to be edited. Edit the code below, replacing #7 with the dbref
of your Time Functions object, #533 with the dbref of your
Miscellaneous Functions object, and #555 with the dbref of your Moon
and Tide Functions object. This code should be placed on a
wizard/inherit object(you can put it on yourself if you want). To run
it, type:
        edit <first dbref>, <last dbref>
This allows you to edit a block of items at once. Keep the number of
items you edit at a time reasonable--20 might a reasonable value--so
you don't load the server too heavily all at once, or run into various
limits; you may need to adjust that number downward, or may be able to
adjust it upward. You might start, for example, with edit 0, 19.

        Remember *not* to edit the object this code is actually on. Stop
one object before it and start again one object afterward.

        It takes some 10-15 minutes to do a thousand objects, generally
speaking.

At this point, whether you're upgrading or doing a new installation,
you should have a large collection of objects and rooms with the code on
them, but with nothing actually running yet.

Type 'note 1' where the box can hear you and make sure you have all
the stuff listed.

Check flags. Everything should be set safe. The box should be set
!no_command. The Global Command object should be set !no_command and
royalty. The Wizard Weather and Time Command object, the Clock, and
the Storm Maker should be set !no_command and inherit. The Emits Bank
should be set royalty. All functions objects and description banks
should be set visual; so should the Weathermaker and the Slave Weather
Station.

Check @uselocks. The Global Commands object shouldn't be locked; the
Wizard Weather and Time Command object should be @uselocked to wizards,
and the Clock and the Storm Maker should be locked to admins.

@link the Global Command object to the Master Room and put it there.
@link the box to your Auxiliary Room and put it there. @link all the
other items to the box and put them there. The Storm Maker is unlocked
because whoever's using it may want to carry it around the IC landscape
to watch how their effects are coming across.

#1 needs to do this:
Read +wtc global-setup to see how to set up the global functions. The
code should run correctly before the global setup, but the
documentation will be incorrect; it assumes the functions to be global.
Set function_invocation_limit on your server up to 12500; this can be
done with @admin function_invocation_limit = 12500, but Keran prefers
to edit the config file in the server account to keep track of config
changes. Not setting the function_invocation_limit up will mean that
descriptions in children of the Parent Rooms will sometimes fail to
evaluate completely, on a somewhat erratic basis, with the moon descs
on clear or fair nights being the usual place for the code to break;
you /won't/ see a FUNCTION INVOCATION LIMIT EXCEEDED error.

Back to an ordinary wizard:
@trigger Clock/startup.

Test the installation so far by typing '+today'. You should get
intelligible results.

Type @ps. You should see the Clock in the wait queue.

Type 'note 2' where the box can hear you for instructions on
installing the initial +help entries.

Type +wtc and read all the entries marked with a *; you may want to
read others besides. You can then type +wta to see the commands you
can use to set up the basic configuration options like the length of
the longest day, the kind of tide, the time compression, the calendar
mode, etc.

Check the Clock, and make sure it has the following in its
triggerlist attributes:

&TRIGGERLIST-TIME~OF~DAY clock=<#Weathermaker> <#Emits Bank> <#Test Room>
&TRIGGERLIST-SUN clock=<#Emits Bank> <#Test Room>
&TRIGGERLIST-MOON clock=<#Emits Bank> <#Test Room>
&TRIGGERLIST-TIDE clock=<#Emits Bank> <#Test Room>
&TRIGGERLIST-HOUR clock=<#Emits Bank> <#Test Room>
&TRIGGERLIST-EVERY~HALFHOUR clock=<#Test Room>
&TRIGGERLIST-EVERY~QUARTERHOUR clock=<#Test Room>
&TRIGGERLIST-EVERY~HOUR clock=<#Test Room>

When you reach this point, you should have a working basic
installation.

I've added a Test Room to the package for 4.0. The acid test of
whether your installation is working, aside from getting sensible
results from +today, is whether you hear all the emits the Clock can
trigger, and all the global emits from the Emits Bank. To this end,
the Test room has on it &trigger-at-<time> attributes which will
@emit to whatever's in the room; it has all the varieties of
&trigger-at-<time> attributes the clock can @trigger, and therefore
also serves as an example of how to create Clock-@triggered effects
on other objects. It also has &hear-weather-emits and &hear-tide-emits
set to one, and therefore if you're in it, you should hear all the
emits the Emits bank sends out. The easiest way to use this is to set
clock compression up to about 24:1 and drop a listening object in it.
You should then hear all the emits from the room and all the global
emits from the Emits Bank, and, over the course of several virtual
days (several real-time hours), the emits from the Emits Bank should
vary with a changing weather type. (You will almost certainly want
to use the Clock's del command to remove the Test Room from the
every~halfhour and every~halfhour triggerlists after you've heard
them a few times; otherwise you'll get spammed unmercifully. You
may want to remove the hourly triggers as well after determining
that they work.)

A note: the room has emits for every time at which the clock can
trigger them. The Emits Bank doesn't. There are no global emits for
the beginnings of the time periods denoted noon, afternoon, midnight,
or after midnight, first; there are global emits at the hours of 0
and 12, instead. Secondly, global emits about the moon rising,
setting, or reaching its zenith are only heard during clear and fair
nights when the moon is not new, so there will be times when you
should hear an emit about the moon from the room, but not from the
Emits Bank.

If you set up regional weather, you will need to @trigger Slave
Weather Station/startup after it's set up; it should be in the
semaphore queue (type @ps) after you do.

There will be future upgrades, but I'm not anticipating making any
more massive structural changes as I did between 3.0 and 4.0. Instead,
they'll be in the form of add-ons and patches, and installing them
will be much simpler than upgrading from 3.0 to 4.0.

&CLOCK-COMPRESSION Weather and Time Help - Admin Commands=%rclock <number>%r%rThis command sets the compression mode to clock and the clock compression ratio to <number>, where <number> is a small whole number, or a decimal ratio of small whole numbers by which 3600 can be evenly divided, e.g, 1.5 (3:2).

&START-TIME Weather and Time Help - Admin Commands=%rstart time <time>%r%rThis command on the Wizard Weather and Time Command object sets the real time from which the Weather and Time Code should begin its reckoning. The format for <time> is the same returned by time(); you don't have to correctly specify the weekday. Any three letters will do. The Wiz Weather Command object must be able to hear you for it to work.%r%rThis command also resets &weathertype and &weathertype-old on the Weathermaker, and &weathertype-master, &slave-weathertype-old, and &slave-weathertype on the Slave Weather Station, because if the new start time changes the season, it is possible that the current weathertypes may be inappropriate.%r

&LONGEST-DAY Weather and Time Help - Admin Commands=%rlongest day <hours>%r%rThis command on the Wizard Weather and Time Command object sets the length of the longest day, in hours; the day length varies with the season. <hours> can be any number from 12 to just under 24, but there are definitely things that will break as you approach 24 hours of daylight, if you're attempting midnight sun effects in a polar setting, and Keran hasn't identified all of them. You must be where the Wiz Weather Command Object can hear you for it to work.%r
&LATITUDE Weather and Time Help - Admin Commands=%rlatitude <degrees>%r%rThis command on the Wizard Weather and Time Command object sets the length of the longest day by calculating it from latitude; the day length varies with the season. <lattitude> can be any number greater than 0 and less than or equal to 66. If you have an equatorial setting, use the longest day command to set a day length of 12 hours, instead of giving this command a latitude of 0; a division-by-0 error will occur. Keran hasn't done testing to determine exactly how close you can get to the poles before the code starts doing jarring things; it is conceivable that latitude 66 may be too high.

@Desc Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=This object has +help for various topics related to setting up and configuring Keran's Weather and Time Code. It has no commands and should be kept in the Auxiliary room.
&BUGS Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rThis code has been tested at calendar compression ratios of 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1, and at clock compression ratios of 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, and 3:2. It appears to work; however, the testing period has not been long enough to let it cycle through a whole year. It is supposed to work correctly and consistently at these ratios; if it doesn't, please tell Keran (keranset@mail1.nai.net).%r%rKeran posts bug fixes in a changes file at the distribution site, ftp://telmaron.telmaron.com/pub/keranset/.%r%rSome known aberrations:%r%rOccasionally, you'll see a message from the Emits bank doubled. This isn't a bug in the Weather and Time Code; it's an aberration in the behavior of the server, and shows up in other code with timed @triggers as well. It doesn't happen often; there's no softcode fix for it.%r%r+wtc bugs2 for more.%r
&BUGS2 Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rRarely, you'll find that for some reason, the weathertypes will not be correctly written to the Weathermaker, which, naturally, breaks everything in the code that depends on the weathertype. This has happened about 3 times at Keranset over the past couple of years. To fix it, manually set weathertypes on the Weathermaker, like so:%r%r&weathertype weathermaker=fair%r&weathertype-old weathermaker=fair%r%rA mysterious and erratic failure to completely evaluate a function can be a sign that the function_invocation_limit for the server is set too low. If you can evaluate a function individually but it fails up as part of something else--a variable desc--this is probably the problem. Set the function_invocation_limit up until it stops happening.%r%rKeran's Weather and Time code, when correctly installed, doesn't write to anything in the database other than itself, when your server is operating normally, unlike some other public code releases.%r
&CALENDARS Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rKeran's weather and timing code comes with three possibilities for calendars: native, Gregorian, and system. System is a true Gregorian calendar that runs off the system clock in 1:1 time compression; the date and time will always be identical to whatever your system clock returns, except that you can change the year. The other two calendars are quasi-Gregorian and the native format, both of which have 360 day years (usually) and 30 day months.%r%rIn the quasi-Gregorian calendar in which December, January, and February constitute winter; March, April, and May, spring; June, July, and August, summer; and September, October, and November, autumn. The dates of the solstices and equinoxes are not accurate in this mode; winter, and the winter solstice, fall on December 1, not December 21 as is the case in the real world.%r%rIn the native calendar, the year and the first month of spring both begin on the vernal equinox.%r%rSee +wta calendars for +help on switching between calendars.%r%rRecoder's notes: calculations are made using the native mode; then month, season, and year are recalculated to produce the quasi-Gregorian timing.%r
&CALENDAR-COMPRESSION Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rIn calendar compression, an IC day passes in 24 real hours, and IC time is accelerated by skipping days in each month, season, and year. At 3:1 calendar compression, for example, an IC month passes in 10 24-hour days. The calendar compression ratio above must be a small positive integer; the code as supplied is designed to handle calendar compression rations of 1, 2, 3, and 4. See +wta calendar-compression for +help on the commands to set the calendar compression.%r%rRecoder's notes: since the code works by counting days, fractional ratios do not work. In order not to break the moon, which has 8 phases and needs at least 8 counted days per month to go through an entire phase cycle, the minimum value of base-days-per-year is 8 phases * 12 months * calendar-compression, and it must be evenly divisible by both 8 and 12. The default value for the base days per year is 360; all calendar compression ratios of 3:1 or lower, as well as typical clock compression ratios, work with this value. The Wizard Weather Command object automatically sets an appropriate value for the base days per year if you use it to reset the calendar compression to 1, 2, 3, or 4.%r
&CLOCK-COMPRESSION Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rWhen IC time is accelerated using clock compression, an IC hour goes by in less than a real hour. The number of seconds in an IC hour is determined by dividing 3600 (the number of seconds in a real hour) by the clock compression ratio. The clock compression ratio is expected to be a small positive number by which 3600 can be evenly divided. It may have a fractional part; for example, you can evenly divide 3600 by 1.5 (a 3 IC hour: 2 real hour ratio). 4, 3, 2, 1, and 1.5 are all acceptable clock compression ratios.%r%rThe effect of using ratios with fractional parts, like 1.5 (3:2), 1.25 (5:4), or 2.5 (5:2), is that it will desynchronize IC time and real time; that is, if a player logs in at the same time of day all the time, it won't always be the same time of day ICly. This can be useful if you wish to accommodate players who log in from other time zones at odd hours.%r%rSee +wta clock-compression for +help on how to set the clock compression.%r
&COMPRESSION Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rThere are two different ways to accelerate IC time in Keran's weather and timing code: clock compression and calendar compression. It is assumed that you will only use one of them at a time, although so far it's produced reasonable results if both the clock and the calendar are compressed; Keran's testing of this has not been rigourous. The code has been tested at clock compression ratios of 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 3:2, and 1:1, and at calendar compression ratios of 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, and 1:1.%r%rIn clock compression, a day goes by faster than it does in real time. For example, if you have a clock compression ratio of 3:1, 24 IC hours will go by in 8 real hours. In calendar compression, on the other hand, a day goes by in 24 hours, but you skip days, so that months, seasons and years pass more quickly. For example, if you have a calendar compression ratio of 2:1, 12 IC months will pass in 6 real months. See +wtc clock-compression, +wtc calendar-compression.%r
&GLOBAL-SETUP Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rYou should put these attributes on #1 to set up the required global +functions:%r%r&SETUP-GLOBAL-FUNCTIONS #1 = @function randword = <dbref of Miscellaneous Functions>/randword; @function tilde2blank = <dbref of Miscellaneous Functions>/tilde2blank; @function blank2tilde = <dbref of Miscellaneous Functions>/blank2tilde%r@startup #1 = @trigger me/setup-global-functions%r%rFor version 4.0 of the Weather and Time Code, you'll need to kick the function_invocation_limit on the server up to handle the recoded in variable descs in children of the parent rooms. Setting function_invocation_limit to 12500 seems to suffice.%r
&GLOBAL-EMITS Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rThe contents of any room which has an attribute &hear-weather-emits set to 1 will hear the weather emits from the Emits Bank, assuming the Emits Bank is on the Clock's lists of items to @trigger (it is, by default). Those supplied are usually only appropriate for outdoor rooms. The outdoor parent rooms and their children are set to hear weather emits by default; if you want to turn off the weather emits in a child of an outdoor parent room, set &hear-weather-emits <room #> = 0.%r%rAny room which has an attribute &hear-tide-emits set to 1 will hear the tide emits from the Emits Bank, assuming the Emits Bank is on the Clock's list of items to trigger at tide changes.%r%rSee +wta clock-commands for information on adding items to the Clock's triggerlists.%r
&FOREIGN-TIMING Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rIn some cases you may wish to use this weather system with other timing code, replacing the Clock and the Time Functions Object. This is not recommended, as the timing code is the guts of the package, but an experienced coder should be able to manage it.%r%rRecoder's notes: in order to use foreign timing code and preserve most of the functionality of this weather system, the timing code must capable of the following:%r%rIt must, at the very least, distinguish between day and night; preferably, it distinguishes between day, night, dawn, and dusk.%rIt must distinguish the seasons spring, summer, autumn, and winter.%rIn order for the parent rooms to work as they do in this system, there must be a function that tells whether the moon is up or not.%rThere must be a clock capable of triggering the Weathermaker at dawn.%r%rIt is beyond the scope of this +help to attempt to explain exactly what steps must be undertaken to make the weather code work with foreign timing; however, the weather system was coded with readability and simplicity of code in mind (given the complexity of the system).%r
&MOONS Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rAdding moons is easier in 4.0 than it was in 3.0, in the sense that you can @clone the Moon and Tide object, strip the unnecessary tide commands off the new object, and set &moon-daylength-difference on the new object to the difference between the amount of time it takes the moon to get around the sky, and 24 hours, in hours. That is to say, if it takes the moon 24.8 hours to get around the sky (the correct figure for Earth's moon, and the default setting for the existing moon), then moon-daylength-difference should be set to .8; if it takes 26 hours, it should be set to 2; if it takes 23.5 hours, it should be set to -.5. The code will handle all the phase and rise-and-set time recalculations, etc., from there, as far as determining how the new moon behaves. However, if you want the new moon to show up in +today, or in the variable descs in the parent rooms, you'll need to edit it in.%r
&PARAMETERS Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rThis is a list of the parameters that you can set to control the basic operation of the Weather and Time Code. See +wta for +help for the commands you can use to set them. The somewhat complex ones are often explained in other +wtc topics.%r%rcompression mode%rcalendar%rcalendar compression ratio%rclock compression ration%rlongest-day-length/latitude%rdiurnal/semidiurnal tide%rregional weather%rstarting-year%rstart-time%r
&PARENT-ROOM-HIERARCHY Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rThere are several parent rooms supplied with version 4.0 of the Weather and Time Code. The parent rooms make it comparatively easy to write rooms whose descriptions vary by time of day, season, weather, lighting conditions, etc. They can be used individually; as supplied, however, they exist in a hierarchy that determines what kind of rooms get what emits from the Stormmaker. You can create your own parent rooms and @parent them to the appropriate ancestors, which avoids your having to recode the Stormmaker to add parent rooms.%r%rAt the top of the hierarchy is the Great-grandparent of Rooms. Any room which is a remote descendant of this room is considered IC, and will receive certain emits from the Stormmaker; those rooms which are not descendants of this room are considered OOC and will not hear Stormmaker emits.%r%r+wtc parents2 for more.%r
&PARENTS2 Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rThe next layer of the hierarchy comprises three rooms:%r%rGrandparent of Outdoor Rooms%rGrandparent of Windowless Indoor Rooms%rGrandparent of Windowed Indoor Rooms%r%rIt is possible to direct Stormmaker emits to the children of only one Grandparent Room, or to those of two of the three. For instance, emits for thunder should go to all three kinds of room; emits for lightning should only go to those with a view outside--Outdoor Rooms and Windowed Indoor Rooms; emits for a power blackout might only go to both kinds of Indoor Room.%r%rNeither the Great-Grandparent nor any of the Grandparent Rooms contain any variable description coding; this is all to be found on the Parent Rooms. There are seven Parent Rooms supplied, two indoor and five outdoor:%r%r+wtc parents3 for more.%r
&PARENTS3 Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rParent of Windowless Indoor Rooms%rParent of Windowed Parent Rooms%rParent of Separable Day-Night and Season Desc Outdoor Rooms%rParent of Season-and-Day-Night Varying Outdoor Rooms%rParent of Separable Day-Night-Dawn-Dusk and Season Desc Outdoor Rooms%rParent of Separable Desc Outdoor Rooms%rParent of Weather-and-Day-Night Varying Outdoor Rooms%r%rThe +parents command returns the names and dbrefs of all grandchildren of the Great-Grandparent of Rooms, so that players can easily refer to a list of which parent rooms are available. The differences between the various outdoor parent rooms are differences in flavors of variable descriptions they'll return. See +wt parents.%r%r+wtc parents4 for more.%r
&PARENTS4 Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rYou may decide that the existing parent rooms are insufficient. For example, you could decide to create a Shore Parent Room whose children would automatically hear tide emits from the Emits Bank. You might do this by @cloning one of the outdoor parent rooms, renaming the clone to Shore Parent Room, setting a &hear-tide-emits Shore Parent Room=1 on it, and then @parenting the Shore Parent to the Grandparent of Outdoor Rooms.%r%rYou might decide that the existing kinds of room are insufficient, so that you need to create a new Grandparent Room. Usually, the reason for doing this, as opposed to creating a new parent room, is that instead of needing to write a new variation on variable description code, you need a new class of room because you're going to recode the Stormmaker to accommodate a very different environment.%r%r+wtc parents5 for more.%r
&PARENTS5 Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rFor instance, if you had a setting that involved humans in a sea lab interacting with civilized dolphins, you might need a Grandparent of Underwater Rooms, because undersea rooms might not appropriately receive messages relating to indoor human environments or surface weather, but you might want to be able to send distinct environmental event messages to them.%r%rThe Stormmaker is slightly misnamed. It's actually a Transient Environmental Effects Generator, and can be used to produce events besides storms--earthquakes, blackouts, and unusual sights in the sky are all within its purview.%r
&REGIONAL-WEATHER Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rWith regional weather set up, different areas of the MUSH experience different weather at the same time. The regions should be about a day apart--since large weather systems move at vastly different speeds that may vary between 5 and 50 miles per hour, depending on the energy of the system, a certain amount of compromise is necessary; 200-300 miles might be a good figure. The Weathermaker becomes the master weather generator, and should control the weather in the region where storms enter the virtual landscape; Slave Weather Stations control the weather in other regions. For example, say your MUSH's landscape covered the southern New England coast; weather systems there have a large tendency to reach the southwestern portions before the northeastern, and so you would set the Weathermaker up to control the southwesternmost region and the first Slave Weather Station up to control a region 200-300 miles northeastward. It is possible to daisy-chain Slave Weather Stations; you could then have a second Slave Weather Station another 200-300 miles northeastward, using the first Slave Weather Station as its master.%r%r+wtc regional2 for more.%r
&REGIONAL2 Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rThe Weathermaker uses yesterday's weather--its own weather--to determine what today's probably is. The Slave Weather Station models weather in a similar fashion, but it uses its master's previous day's weather to determine what its own probably will be. In the default configuration, usually the slave will select the master's weather of the previous day for its own weather, but sometimes it will select something else. In this way weather systems seem to move from one region to another, with some variation.%r%rTo set up regional weather, you need to do the following:%r%r1) Determine the areas on your MUSH that belong to each region, and which region will belong to the Weathermaker.%r%r2) Set up the Weathermaker for regional weather by typing 'regional' where the Wizard Weather Command object can hear you. This changes the &generator attribute on the Weathermaker so that, after picking its own weather, it notifies the slave to select a new weathertype for the day also. If you wish to remove this later, the 'no regional' command on the Wizard Weather Command object will do it.%r%r+wtc regional3 for more.%r
&REGIONAL3 Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%r3) You will need to make it clear in your documentation somewhere that rooms in the Slave Region should use the slave weather functions instead of the master weather functions. One set of slave weather functions is included on the Time Functions Object as an example.%r%r4) You can't use a single Emits Bank to broadcast time of day messages to multiple regions unless you change the messages on it: the ones supplied vary with the weather, and all regions may not have the same weather. To set up an Emits Bank for a second region, you will need to set &hear-weather-emits on rooms in it to 0, and select another attribute name that can be searched for, such as &hear-slaveweather-emits, like so:%r%r&hear-slaveweather-emits <room>=1%r&hear-weather-emits <room> = 0%r%r+wtc regional4 for more.%r
&REGIONAL4 Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=Then @clone the Emits Bank, rename the copy to Slave Emits Bank, and @edit it so that its searches use your new attribute name instead of &hear-weather-emits:%r%r@edit Slave Emits Bank=hear-weather-emits, hear-slaveweather-emits%r%rAdd the Slave Emits Bank's database # to the Clock's triggerlists (type +wta clock-commands for help on this).%r%r+wtc regional5 for more.%r
&REGIONAL5 Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rIf you wish to make another slave station, you will have to do the following:%r%r1) Clone the Slave Weather Station.%r%r2) Edit the *first* Slave Weather Station's &generator attribute so that it reads:%r%r@wait me={&weathertype-old me = \[u(weathertype)\]; &weathertype-master me = \[u(<dbref of Weathermaker>/weathertype-old)\]; &weathertype me = \[u(\[u(<dbref of Time Functions>/season)\]type-\[u(weathertype-master)\])\]; @notify <database # of Secondary Slave Weather Station>; @trigger me/generator}%r%rThis change causes it to notify the Secondary Slave Station to select its own weathertype of the day.%r%r+wtc regional6 for more.%r
&REGIONAL6 Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%r3) Now edit the &generator attribute on the Secondary Slave Station, so that the &weathertype-master command refers not to the Weathermaker, but to the first Slave Weather Station; it's going to read the first slave, not the Weathermaker, to determine its probable weather.%r%rYou will need to add another set of slave functions to the Miscellaneous Functions object, possibly called slave2-* instead of slave-*, set rooms in the Secondary Slave region with a &hear-slave2weather-emits attribute on it instead of &hear-weather-emits, and @clone another edited copy of the Emits Bank whose dbref must be added to the Clock's triggerlists.%r%rThere are various ways to approach regional weather architecture. You can set up more than one slave station that depends directly on the Weathermaker, or on a higher-ranking Slave Weather Station. You can set up more than one Weathermaker to have multiple independent masters.%r%r+wtc regional7 for more.%r
&REGIONAL7 Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rIt's been asked whether you can to use this weather and timing code to set up different time zones. It has not been tested, but it seems likely that you could make second copy of the Time Functions Object and change time-begins slightly, so that it began 3600 secs / clock-compression after time-begins on the first Time Functions Object. It would be a nuisance to document this; you would no longer have a globally-valid value for hour, time-of-day, etc. You would probably need more than one Weathermaker and more than one set of parent rooms, if you're using the parent rooms, to make it work without significant code alterations.%r
&TIDE Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rSome places, typically those on the shores of huge oceans like the Pacific, have diurnal tide cycles, or one high and one low tide per day, while others have semi-diurnal tide cycles with two high tides and two low tides per day. See +wta tide for +help setting the tide cycle.%r
&VARYING-THE-WEATHER Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rThere are three fundamental ways to vary the weather produced by the weather code. They are:%r%r1) Changing the frequency with which various weathertypes are selected at each season. Instructions for how to do this are provided in +wtc weather-modelling.%r%rExperienced recoders may introduce new weathertypes; see +wtc weather-modelling.%r%r2) Changing the descriptions of the weathertypes by writing new desc banks. This is conceptually very simple, though laborious. You rewrite the descriptions in the desc banks to fit the kind of environment you want descriptions for. The descriptions in the Long Weather Description Bank assume a temperate climate; you could write desc banks for areas where the climate was usually warmer or colder. The Tree Weather Description Bank, supplied as an example of environmental variation with auxiliary desc banks, assumes a temperate, relatively wet climate with many leafy trees. It would be possible to write desc banks for conifer forests, grassland, deserts, tundra, cities, shores, the sky, or any sort of environment you like.%r%r+wtc varying2 for more.%r
&VARYING2 Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%r3) Varying the weather from place to place by using regional weather. Here it is not the quality of the weather that varies, but when it arrives at different regions. Instructions for setting up regional weather can be found in +wtc regional-weather.%r
&WEATHER-MODELLING Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rThe Weathermaker saves yesterday's weathertype, and then uses the season and yesterday's weathertype to determine which routine it should use to pick the weather for today. For example, the springtype-clear attribute is used to generate today's weather if it was clear yesterday and the season is spring. The springtype-clear attribute selects today's weather at random from among the following types: (clear clear clear clear clear fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair rain fog stormy overcast). The more often a weathertype is repeated, the more likely it is to be selected. Clear weather is generally a strong high pressure area, and a brisk clear day is more often followed by another, or by a day not so brisk where there are many fair weather clouds, than it is to be followed directly by rain, storm, fog, or overcast skies. The probability of the weathertypes varies from season to season; fog is always more likely in summer, while sleet, snow, and blizzards only appear in winter.%r%r+wtc modelling2 for more.%r
&MODELLING2 Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rTo change the probability of a given weathertype being selected, you need to add or reduce the number of times it appears in arguments to randword() in the &<season>type-<weathertype> attrbutes on the Weathermaker. For instance, if you want less fog in summer, reduce the number of times 'fog' appears in the &summertype-<weathertype> attributes. You might, e.g., execute the following:%r%r@edit weathermaker/summertype-* = fog fog fog fog fog,fog fog%r%rRecoder's notes: if you add a weathertype to the code, you will need to account for it in the &<season>type-<weathertype> selectors on the Weathermaker, in the &<season><weathertype> short descriptions on the Weathermaker, in the &<season><day|night|dawn|dusk><weathertype> attributes in the long desc bank, and in appropriate attributes in any auxiliary desc banks you may using, like the Tree Weather Description Bank.%r%r+wtc modelling3 for more.%r
&MODELLING3 Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rThere is one non-obvious point, however: the season changes at virtual midnight, while a new weathertype for the day is not selected until virtual dawn. If you add a weathertype that isn't going to appear in all seasons, you will need to add settings and descriptions for it in the next season to cover the hours between midnight and dawn. For example, sleet, lightsnow, and blizzard are only selected by the Weathermaker in winter; there are &springtype-sleet, &springtype-lightsnow, and &springtype-blizzard weather selector attributes on the weathermaker, which may be invoked on the first day of spring if the last day of winter's weather was frozen preciptation; these selectors only include spring weather in the possibilities they choose between, naturally. There are also &springsleet, &springlightsnow, and &springblizzard short descriptions on the weathermaker, and &spring<day|night|dawn|dusk>sleet, &spring<day|night|dawn|dusk>lightsnow, and &spring<day|night|dawn|dusk>blizzard attributes on the Long Description Bank. The content of these descriptions does not describe winter weather, but spring; they correspond to the spring rain, overcast, and stormy descriptions respectively, so as not to contradict the seasonal descriptions in children of the various parent rooms.%r
&NEXT-VERSION Weather and Time Help - Configuration Considerations=%rThere have been major structural changes between 3.0 and 4.0 in order to accommodate the revision of the moon and tides for reasonableness, and the Stormmaker. Keran doesn't currently have any plans for revisions involving such structural changes, but there will probably eventually be an astronomical add-on that handles constellations and planets.%r

@Desc Weather and Time Help - General=This is +wt, the main +help for Keran's Weather and Time Code Package. It should be set visual, safe, and no_command, and it belongs in the Auxiliary room. The items documented on this object are expected to be generally useful to builders and coders.
&HELP_+PARENTS Weather and Time Help - General=%r+parents%r%r+Parents returns a list of parent rooms you can use to build rooms with descriptions that vary according to the time of day, weather, etc. You build your room, @parent it to one of the parent rooms, and look at it to see instructions for how to write descriptions that vary according to environmental conditions. You can simply write descriptions for day, night, winter, summer, etc., and the parent room will switch them at the appropriate times.%r%rThere are two indoor parent rooms, one for rooms with windows and one for rooms without, and several outdoor parent rooms which have style variations in the variable descs returned. The parent rooms are set visual and you can examine <dbref> to see how they work.%r%r+wt +parents2 for more.%r
&HELP_+PARENTS2 Weather and Time Help - General=%rThe outdoor room style variations are:%r%rSeparable Day-Night - This room will return a description consisting of an unchanging desc, a day/night desc, a spring/summer/autumn/winter desc, a weather desc, and a moon desc. You can suppress any elements you don't want, e.g., you can prevent it from showing a moon description.%r%rSeparable Day-Night-Dawn-Dusk - As above, but instead of returning a description that varies only by day and night, it returns different descriptions at day, night, dawn, and dusk.%r%rSeason and Day-Night - Returns a desc for summer-night, a desc for summer-day, a desc for autumn-night, a desc for autumn-day, and so on. Also returns a moon desc and a weather desc.%r%rSeason and Day-Night-Dawn-Dusk - As above, but also returns distinct dawn and dusk descriptions, e.g, winter-dawn, winter-dusk, etc.%r%rWeather and Day-Night - Returns descriptions that combine day-night and weather variations, e.g., fair-night, fair-day, overcast-day, etc. Also returns a moon desc%r
&HELP_+TODAY Weather and Time Help - General=%r+today%r%r+Today returns information about the time of day, month, season, year, tides, weather, etc.%r
&HELP_DATE+TIME Weather and Time Help - General=%ru(#7/year)%ru(#7/season)%ru(#7/month)%ru(#7/week)%ru(#7/hour)%ru(#7/clock-face-hour)%r%rA collection of functions returning the virtual or in-character date and time. Season is spring, summer, autumn, or winter. Month may return either the Gregorian month or the months of a non-Gregorian calendar, depending on which has been configured. Week returns which week it is in the month, which may be 1-5. Hour returns the hour in 24 hour format; midnight is hour 0. Clock-face-hour returns the hour in 12-hour format; midnight and noon are both 12.%r
&HELP_INSIDE+OUTSIDE Weather and Time Help - General=%ru(#533/is-outside)%ru(#533/is-inside)%ru(#533/has-outside-view)%ru(#533/is-inside-with-window)%ru(#533/is-inside-without-window)%r%rIf your room has been @parented to one of the parent rooms that's part of this package, and the parent room hierarchy has been installed, then this function will return 1 if the given condition is true and 0 if it's not. This can be useful for determining whether something can be sensed in a given room, e.g., lightning should only be seen in rooms that are outside or have windows, but thunder may be heard anywhere. These functions won't work on Penn installations with safer_ufun set.%r
&HELP_SLAVE-WEATHER Weather and Time Help - General=%ru(#114/slave-weathertype)%ru(#533/slave-short-weather)%ru(#533/slave-long-weather)%ru(#533/slave-tree-weather)%r%rIf regional weather has been configured, there may be more than one weather region. This code comes with one slave weather station which produces a weathertype for the day sometimes differing from that of the master Weathermaker. The slave weather functions work precisely like long-weather, short-weather, and tree-weather, which see, but are selected according to the Slave Weather Station's weathertype.%r%rIt is possible to have multiple slave stations and there may be more than one set of slave weather functions; these must be locally defined and documented.%r
&HELP_CLOCK-COMMANDS Weather and Time Help - General=%r+clock add <dbref> <triggerlist>%r+clock del <dbref> <triggerlist>%r%rIf these commands are enabled, they you to add or delete items from the Clock's triggerlists, so that the Clock can trigger commands on them at appropriate times. <dbref> is the number of the item to be added to the Clock's triggerlists, and <triggerlist> is which triggerlist to use. The triggerlist must be time-of-day, sun, moon, tide, hour, every-hour, every-half-hour, or every-quarterhour. An item to be triggered must have an attribute &trigger-at-<time> = <action to be triggered>, where <time> is dawn, sunrise, morning, noon, afternoon, dusk, sunset, night, midnight, after~midnight, moonrise, moonset, meridian~transit, every~hour, every~halfhour, every~quarterhour, 0 through 23, high~and~rising, high~and~slack, high~and~ebbing, low~and~ebbing, low~and~slack, low~and~rising. Use &trigger-at-0 and &trigger-at-12 for triggering at precisely midnight and noon; the times of day called noon and midnight are time stretches.%r
&HELP_WEATHER+TIME Weather and Time Help - General=%rKeran's Weather and Time Code is a configurable MUSH/MUX softcode package for maintaining virtual or in-character environments. It has +help divided into three sections:%r%r+wt - +help for common commands, functions and topics generally useful to builders and coders.%r%r+wta - Admin commands.%r%r+wtc - Configuration considerations. Extensive and sometimes complex, since there are many non-vanilla ways to set up this code, depending on the environment you're trying to model.%r
