@fail Tarot=Your hands move towards the ancient plaques, but your better sense restrains you.
@desc Tarot=This elegant deck of cards seems quite ancient in appearance-each plaque hand-painted in a riot of vivid colour. Strange symbols decorate the margins of the cards, while figures you've never seen before dominate their centres. A most  disturbing air surrounds them, as if more than a few sins of Man have been read from their eldritch faces. <tarothelp>

&info_tarot Tarot=$+tarot:@pemit %#=[repeat(-,78)]%rWhat is the Tarot?%r[repeat(-,78)]%r"The origins of the Tarot deck are shrouded in mystery. The time, place, and circumstances of its creation are largely a matter of speculation. Some people believe the deck dates back to Egyptian and Sumerian civilizations, where the ancients used it to symbolize the secret teachings of their mystery religions. The most popular belief is that Tarot cards were brought to Europe by fortunetelling gypsies coming from either Egypt of India. In any case, the cards were widespread in Italy, France, and Germany by the late 14th century."%r[repeat(-,78)]%rFrom 'Tarot Unveiled: The Method To its Magic' by Laura Clarson%r[repeat(-,78)]
&info_deck Tarot=$+deck:@pemit %#=[repeat(-,78)]%rStructure of the Tarot deck:%r[repeat(-,78)]%rThe Tarot deck consists of 78 cards, including 56 Minor Arcana cards and 22 Major Arcana Cards.%r%rThe Minor Arcana are similar in structure to an ordinary deck of playing cards:%r%rSwords (Spades)%t%tIntellectual matters and discord, struggle, and strife.%rCups (Hearts)%t%tEmotions and affairs of the heart.%rWands (Clubs)%t%tEnterprise, creativity, and energy.%rPentacles (Diamonds)%tMoney and business affairs. Material things%r%rThe Major Arcana begins with the Fool and ends with the World. Only the Fool, in the form of the Joker, has survived in present-day playing cards, although there is some debate about this. The Major Arcana symbolize a cycle of growth and evolution of consciousness and spiritual awareness.%r[repeat(-,78)]%rDerived from 'Tarot Unveiled: The Method To its Magic' by Laura Clarson%r[repeat(-,78)]
&info_div Tarot=$+divination:@pemit %#=[repeat(-,78)]%rThe Tarot: A Religious Object?%r[repeat(-,78)]%rSome people perceive the Tarot as a religious object. Some even refuse to have anything to do with it because of this. Anyone who studies the Tarot will reconsider this notion. The cards are many things to many people. It can be a tool to inspire ideas and creativity, or to help tell stories. It can help focus your unconscious. It contains archetypal images of characters and happenings that take place at every moment in our world. People may attach some religious meaning to the Tarot, but in and of itself, it is merely an interesting tool. Make your own decision.%r[repeat(-,78)]%rOther Tarot References: 'The Element Tarot Handbook' by Naomi Ozaniec, 'Jung and Tarot: An Archetypal Journey' Sallie Nichols, and 'Secrets of Gypsy Fortunetelling' by Ray Buckland.%r[repeat(-,78)]%rDT King's Tarot WWW page -- http://www.iii.net/users/dtking/tarot.html%r[repeat(-,78)]
