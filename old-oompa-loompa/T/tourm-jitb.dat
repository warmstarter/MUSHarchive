DESC=This toy came in 2nd in Internet World's 'Coolest Useless Gizmo' contest as judged by Eric Berlin. Eric says in his article that "obviously this gizmo didn't come with instructions". Next time you're on a MUSH, Eric, try using the look command. Thanks for the mention though. NOTE:  Objects for the JitB can be downloaded from the documentation page.
