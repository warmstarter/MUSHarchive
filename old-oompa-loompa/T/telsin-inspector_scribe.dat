DESC=This lil tool is used to create useable inspection notes for   a builder. It records all notes by roomdbref, and has sense enough not to overwrite   previous notes for the same room. The gnote command also adds sequential notes, not   limited to a specific room-dbref.  NOTE: This program requires an unformatter utility.
