If installing a new system, or upgrading from a version prior to 2.0, the
files should be quoted in the following order:

Base
Data
User
Admin

If upgrading from version 2.0 to version 2.1, simply quote patch-2.0-2.1.

Each file requires pre-processing with a standard MUSH unformatting utility.
MUNF, one of the numerous programs that can accomplish this, should be
available from the site where you obtained this code.
