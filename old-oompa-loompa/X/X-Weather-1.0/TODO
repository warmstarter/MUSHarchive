#     This file is a list of all those neato-thingies that I just      #
#  plain haven't done yet. Some of them are under progress, some       #
#  I am considering, and might work on if I get very bored, or get     #
#  enough requests. A * indicates a feature I am working on now.       #
#  A ? indicates a feature I am considering, but would like feedback   #
#  on. An unmarked feature means I might get around to it if I'm       #
#  very, VERY bored :)                                                 #
#                                                                      #

#                                                                      #
# ?   Add local areas (non-dynamic,quick update,"burst" effect)        #
#       (Hopefully, this will be an 'upgrade', added on to the         #
#       existing system, and not require a complete re-install)        #
# *   Add a simple code chunk for builders, etc. to access weather     #
#       from descs. (This is possible now, just very ugly - the code   #
#       will probly be very similar to that of +weather/+predict)      #
# ?   Add utilities to change admin options within the game (you can   #
#       currently view them with +weather options on the Control       #
#       Interface, but must change them by hand, or in the source      #
# ?   Add commands to assist in building/maintaining a flow control    #
#       network. This is currently manual, and probly the hardest      #
#       part of setup. I'd appreciate suggestions on what would be     #
#       most helpful here.                                             #
# ?   Add in a function that can auto-trigger attributes on rooms.     #
#       This would allow rooms to show a message when the weather      #
#       updates. It might possibly require wiz-powers (in fact, I'm    #
#       almost certain it would)                                       #
# *   Add a lock to +predict, to allow it's use by those who pass      #
#       the lock (a standard MUSH lock format)                         #
#                                                                      #
