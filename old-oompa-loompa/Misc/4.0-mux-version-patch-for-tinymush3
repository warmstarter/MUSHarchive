This is a patch that will make the MUX version 4.0 of the 
Weather and Time Code work with Tinymush 3.0. The MUX version
is more capable than the TinyMUSH 2.2 version.

The patch is necessary because TinyMUSH 3.0 can't handle
32-character attribute names. If you install the MUX version
new on TinyMUSH 3.0, or if you have used a conversion script
on a MUX database, you'll find that the moon won't work
because of it.

As of this writing the latest TinyMUSH 3.0 release, b20,
has memory leaks. If you're going to install the Weather
and Time code on TM3, @restart your server periodically.
Once a day is good.

For a new TM3 installation, install the MUX version as normal,
ignore all the 'I don't understand that flag' errors, and
then make the following changes.
