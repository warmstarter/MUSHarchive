This file documents changes in quickbuild.

Version 1.07
* ZMRs and parent rooms, when created by quickbuild, are now dug and (for ZMRs)
  zone-locked before any other rooms. Other rooms are no longer zone-locked.
  These rooms are now dug even when there's no code for them.
* Code on rooms is now run just after the room is dug, rather than
  when returning to the room to perform links. This means you shouldn't
  expect your ROOM.* attribs to be available.
* ROOM.* attribs now stomp non-word chars (like accented chars)

Version 1.06
* @lock/zone all rooms on creation. This allows use of ROOM ZONE:
  without warnings.

Version 1.05
* Print the graph as a comment at the top of the file.

Version 1.04
* Parent/zone rooms/exits can now be generated in-line, rather than
  specifying external dbrefs.

Version 1.03
* Removed the @wait syncs (which never worked that well), since
  players can set attribs on themselves with evaluation
  by using @set

Version 1.02
* Updated to work with the new Graph (v0.2 and later) API

Version 1.01
* Fix: Exits were not correctly linked to destination rooms with 
  spaces in their names 

Version 1.0
* Initial quickbuild release
