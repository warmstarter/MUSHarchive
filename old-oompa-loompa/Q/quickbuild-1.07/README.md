quickbuild is a perl script that lets you quickly lay out a MUSH area
(a set of rooms connected by exits, optionally zoned and/or parented)
in an easy-to-use format. It converts this file into uploadble MUSH
code. It's smart about cardinal directions (aliases and reverse exits),
<b>racket style, and a few other things.

quickbuild is written in Perl and requires Perl version 5 and two
additional modules (see INSTALL for details).
