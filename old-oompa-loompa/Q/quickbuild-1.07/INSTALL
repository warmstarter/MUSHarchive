quickbuild - a speedy way to build MUSH areas

INSTALLATION

0) quickbuild requires perl5, and three extra modules: Graph (at least
   version 0.2), Text::Wrap, and Class::MethodMaker.

   If you don't have the Graph and Class::MethodMaker modules installed,
   you'll need to install them. Get them from 
     http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Graph
      (find something like Graph-0.201.tar.gz)
     http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Class
      (find something like Class-MethodMaker-0.92.tar.gz)

   Text::Wrap comes with perl.

1) Run the Configure script by typing:
	sh Configure

2) Install the program and manual page by typing:
	make install
   You may need to be root for this. This will also create a text
   version of the manual page.

3) Set up a configuration file for quickbuild. Most people will just
   want to copy sample.qbcfg to .qbcfg (or qb.cfg) in their home directory.

Read the manual for quickbuild and you're ready to go!
