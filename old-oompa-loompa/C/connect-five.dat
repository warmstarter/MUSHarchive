DESC=Connect Five is pretty much like Connect Four with a few major exceptions.  1)  You can place anywhere on the board, rather than just at the bottom.  2)  After 12 moves, you may not place any new pieces on the board but instead, you must move them to horizontally or vertically adjacent squares.  3)  The board is bigger!
