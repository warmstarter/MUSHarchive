The Comsystem should contain the following files:

	ComInstxxx - The version of the comsystem (ie: ComInst623)
        howto.txt  - A document on the major functionality of the comsystem.
	readme.1st - This document.
        parse.sh   - Script for re-applying bad /quote installs

The ComInst file is a TinyFugue /quotable file.  If you quote in the file,
it will automatically configure and install your system (minus including
it in the master room).  It recognizes most of the commonly used MUSH based
systems.  Current systems that are recognized:
	TinyMUSH  - All versions. (including most derivitives)
	PennMUSH  - All versions. (Including nearly all derivitives)
	TinyMUX   - All versions.
	RhostMUSH - All versions.
	TinyMURE  - All versions.

Systems that are *not* recognized or compatable:
	MOO       - All versions.
	ColdMUD   - All versions.
	TinyMUSE  - All versions.

The howto.txt file is an extensive features and Questions/Answers document
that will allow the maintainer of the comsystem to know most of the beefy
features and various ways to customize it to their needs.  It includes
enabling/disabling commands, setting/unsetting configurations/aliases/etc,
and global parameters that can be set on the fly.

If there are any problems, notify Ashen-Shugar (phoenix@medsys.med.wayne.edu)
and when time allows he will answer your questions on a first come first
serve basis.


Bugs and missing features:
There are probably small bugs in the comsystem along with missing features.
Most of the bugs have been fixed and if there exist others, let the author
know and he'll fix those as soon as possible.  

Currently, there are no known bugs other than spelling errors.

Missing features include the ability to remove nuked players as a whole from
all channels.  Currently this is too large a load on the system to deem
important enough to add.

For version information, check out the on-line help of the comsystem for
'changes'.  'channel' is the main menu.
