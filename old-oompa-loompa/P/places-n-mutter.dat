DESC='Places' is a global system which allows for the creation of virtual places within rooms. This allows tables, chairs, rugs, alcoves, and similar areas to exist without the necessity of physical objects.  'mutter' is a set of globals which allow players to mutter messages to each other. Muttered messages are shown in part to other players in the room, with some of the text removed.
