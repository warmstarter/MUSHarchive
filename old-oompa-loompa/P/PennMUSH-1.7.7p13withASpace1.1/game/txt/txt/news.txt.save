~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Star Trek: Encounters~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the 
Starship Tempest. It's mission: to explorer strange new 
worlds; to serve as a hub of interstellar diplomacy through 
its crew from all the powers of the Alpha and Beta 
Quadrants and some from the other quadrants as well;to 
defend the federation, its allies, and its interests; to 
attempt to make sense of the tempest of our times.
   STE is a single-ship MUSH, set approximately 15 years 
after 'What You Leave Behind...'[DS9]. The ship is the USS 
Tempest, on which lives and works a crew from all over the 
galaxy. With 125+ rooms, Roleplay is interesting. We are 
running ASpace v1.1 and should be ready to go IC soon and 
are currently acceptin new players and the chargen 
(Character Generation) process is available. So come join. 
Once we have a complete senior staff (most positions are 
available at the time of this writing) we will launch. So 
come on down!

Tempest: A Furious agitation, commotion, or tumult; an 
uproar: The tempest in my mind/Doth from my senses take

Twink
Just listening to the name, you must realize this is something you do not wish to be labeled. The twink is the most hated of
the newbie species. They are charactarized by immature 14 year-olds who cannot comprehend the notion of cooperative
roleplay. They seem to go off to a world of their own, ignoring the MUSH world they are actually in -- unfortunately, they
make it impossible for the converse to take place. 

The twink speaks out-of-character in an in-character situation. The twink ignores what others pose. The twink ignores any
standards of canon set for the MUSH world. The twink creates the most powerful character he or she possibly can, and then
proceeds to pretend they rule the world. The twink spoils the enjoyment of others by dominating whatever RP they happen to
be in, whether or not they know what is going on. The twink annoys the holy bejeebers out of everybody. 'Nuff said. 

The sad truth is, most MUSHers start out as twinks. Of course, some may be better than others, but I'll bet there isn't a
MUSHer out there who can look back on his or her first month of MUSHing, and honestly say there wasn't at least a hint of
twinkishness there. 

But there is hope; some newbies realize they are getting negative reactions, and try to seek out the reasons. Others are
lucky, and some kind dino explains to them why they are annoying (in the kindest possible way, of course). 

But there are some twinks that never catch on. They may graduate from the newbie stage, but they never graduate from the
twink stage. Fortunately, there is a natural selection device: once a person has made it clear they intend to remain a
twink, he or she will be ostracized by the knowledgeable of the MUSH community. They will be ignored. People will leave the
room when they walk in; or more severely, they will log off. Twinks have a tendency t
