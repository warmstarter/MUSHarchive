- Version 1.7.7 patchlevel 6                      January 23, 2003
- 
- Major changes:
-   * Rewrite of the flag system. The new system allows for any number
-     of flags, which may apply to any set of object types (the flags/toggles
-     distinction has been eliminated). Flags without single-character
-     abbreviations are better supported. Flags are stored in the object
-     database, and are referenced in hardcode and the db by the name
-     of the flag rather than bit positions.  Older databases will be
-     automatically converted to the new format on load, but can not be
-     converted back (so make backups!). New flaglocal.dst file for
-     hardcode patch hackers to add custom flags.
-   * Rewrite of the matcher code (src/match.c). Some semantics of the
-     matching have changed: matching adjectives are parsed earlier and
-     restrict the match for greater efficiency; they also behave more
-     close as described in the help with respect to object ordering.
-     In addition, you can now do things by dbref without controlling
-     the object in many cases that previously required control.
-     Provoked by bug reports by Intrevis@M*U*S*H and Philip Mak.
- Commands:
-   * @flag allows God to manipulate flags within the game, including 
-     adding new flags. Flags additions/changes are maintained across
-     reboots, so this command does not need to be run at every startup.
- Functions:
-   * lflags(), orlflags(), andlflags() return or test flag lists.
- Minor changes:
-   * New NUMVERSION macro defined in hdrs/version.h that can be tested
-     by hardcode hacks to add code conditional on version.
-   * Much cleanup of @wall. Minimally-user-visible changes:
-     The @rwallemit, @rwallpose, @wallemit, @wallpose, @wizemit and
-     @wizpose commands have been removed. @wall no longer accepts the
-     /wizard, /royalty, and /pose switches, and @rwall and @wizwall accept
-     the /emit switch. Suggested by Vadiv@M*U*S*H, though he'd really
-     rather see @wall removed.
-   * @lock and @unlock now show which type of lock was set/cleared.
-     @lset now specifically notes that lock flags are being changed.
-     Suggested by Tanaku@M*U*S*H.
- Fixes:
-   * @boot/me will no longer boot a connection if it is the sole
-     connection the player, even if it's technically inactive.
-     Suggested by Ambrosia@M*U*S*H.
-   * @boot'ing an active self (by descriptor) crashes the MUSH.
-     Discovered by Ashlynn@ChicagoMUSH.
-   * The thorn and eth characters generated with accent() would
-     convert to 'th' when stripped or viewed under NOACCENT, which
-     could be very confusing in object names. Same for the German sharp
-     s, which converted to 'ss'. Until we can cleverly set up separate
-     tables for object name unparsing, these have been reverted to their
-     old behavior so that stripaccents(accent(X,Y)) should return X for
-     any X and Y. Reported by DeeJee, Intrevis, and Time (@M*U*S*H).
