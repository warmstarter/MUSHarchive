+ Version 1.7.7 patchlevel 13                     April 9, 2003
+ 
+ Major changes:
+   * Interactions (something like "realms" in mux2). Two functions
+     in local.c can now be used to control conditions under which
+     objects can see, hear, or match each other. Possibly useful for 
+     implementing umbral worlds, etc. Patch by Vadiv@M*U*S*H.
+ Functions:
+   * children(), syntactic sugar for lsearch(all,parent,<dbref>).
+     Suggested by Kyieren@M*U*S*H. Patch by BlaZe@M*U*S*H.
+   * powers() can now take a second argument to set an @power.
+     Suggested by Rob@BtFMUSH.
+ Minor changes:
+   * @config/set can now set null strings. Suggested by Cheetah@M*U*S*H.
+   * In restart, set LC_ALL as well as LANG from the given LANG value,
+     in case the user's got an LC_ALL in their shell.
+   * The channel buffer shifting code has gotten much more efficient.
+     Suggested by [TAP].
+   * @function/restrict can accept arguments of the form '!<restriction>'
+     to clear a restriction. Suggested by Saturn@M3.
+   * Most of the asterisk lines between different login message files
+     have been removed. Suggested by Vadiv@M*U*S*H most recently.
+ Fixes:
+   * Fixes from 1.7.6p9.
+   * Win32 portability fixes. [EEH]
+   * deny_silent in access.cnf was ignored in several cases, and no
+     longer is. Patch by Cloud@Sci-Fi Chat
+   * Help fixes by Cheetah@M*U*S*H and LeeLaLimaLLama@M*U*S*H.
