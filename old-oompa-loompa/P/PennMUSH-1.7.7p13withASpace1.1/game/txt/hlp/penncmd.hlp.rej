    is a function, is replaced by each dbref sequentially. Classes EPLAYER,
    EROOM, EEXIT, and EOBJECT work like EVAL but are restricted to a single type.

-   For the class TYPE=PLAYER, and for  PLAYER=<player-name>, anyone may
-   obtain information on any player.  In all other cases, only wizards may
-   obtain information about other players. This is computationally
-   expensive, costing 100 pennies. It is generally faster than @find.
-   
-   Examples:  
-     @search flags=Wc      <-- search for connected wizards.
-     @search type=room     <-- list all rooms owned by me.
-     @search zone=#50      <-- list all objects belong to zone #50.
-     @search Joe eval=1,100,200   <-- list objects from #100-#200 owned by Joe.
-     @search eval=gt(money(##),10)     <-- list all objects owned by me  
-                                           worth more than 10 coins.

!   Page takes four switches: /list, /blind, /noeval and /port. 
    The /list and /blind switches provide two different ways of handling
    pages to lists of players. With /list, each paged player sees the
    list of who was paged, and the paging player is notified only once.
    With /blind, it's as if each player was individually paged. 
    The default list behavior is set by the blind_page @config option.
    The /noeval switch prevents the MUSH from evaluating the message.
    The /port switch is admin-only, and will page a port descriptor directly, 
    including connections that have not yet logged into a player.
