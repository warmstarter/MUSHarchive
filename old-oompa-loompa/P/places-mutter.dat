DESC=This is the familiar places/mutter package, originally written for TinyMUSH, which allows you to configure virtual 'places' within a room. Places allow you to speak privately with a small group without leaving the larger area, set descriptions for sub-sections of a room that are visible with the plook command, etc. Mutter allows you to whisper messages to another person or people while having portions of your whisper overheard by others in the area.
