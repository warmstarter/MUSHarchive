Subject: A little bit of code!
Date: Mon, 22 Mar 93 10:28:43 GMT


I just thought I would make a small contribution to this mailing
list that seems to be rather dead at the moment! I built a little
device that I have found extremely handy. The code is not very
complicated and the device is simple. 

I wish more people would post their masterpieces here even if they
are extremely simple, afterall what seems simple to you may not
be so simple to a begginner. So here goes(Excuse the name! I 
couldn't think of anything better - suggestions please!)

The Room Rememberer
Designed and coded by Hangover

@create Room Remember<rr>=10

@Desc Room Remember<rr>=%rThis is a small device that lets you remember the numb
ers of rooms that you visit. It is very handy when you want to go back to a cert
ain room and you can't get its number. The commands available are:%r%r%tstore%t-
 store a room name and number%r%trecall%t- display all the rooms currently store
d%r%twipe #%t- wipe a room number from memory eg. wipe #1234%r%rThis device also
 stores whether a room can be teleported to ie. if they are set jump_ok or you ow
n them.%r%r%tDesigned and coded by Hangover.%r%r

&REMEMBER_ROOM Room Remember<rr>=$store:@switch member(v(stored),rloc(me,2))=>0,
{@pemit num(*%N)=You already have this room stored.},{&STORED me=v(stored) [rloc
(me,2)];@pemit num(*%N)=You store [name(rloc(me,2))] in memory.}

&REMEMBERED_ROOMS Room Remember<rr>=$recall:@pemit num(*%N)=You have stored the
following rooms(* = jump_ok):%r;@dolist v(stored)={@switch hasflag(##,J)=1,{@pem
it num(*%N)=* [name(##)] [##]},{@pemit num(*%N)=%b%b[name(##)] [##]}}

&FORGET_ROOM Room Remember<rr>=$wipe *:@switch member(v(stored),%0)=>0,{&STORED
me=edit(v(stored),%0,);@pemit num(*%N)=You have wiped %0 from memory.},{@pemit n
um(*%N)=You do not have room %0 stored in memory.}

&STORED Room Remember<rr>=

mailing list.
Improvements will be greatly appreciated!

One question(I know this is going to sound stupid) but what is a
Dynamic Room Builder???

Anyway till next time.
