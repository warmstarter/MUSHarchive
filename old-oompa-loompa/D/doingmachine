Well its that time again when I bring to you a simple little bit
of code. Most of you will probably have one of these already but
for those of you who dont here goes.



The Doing Machine
-----------------
This is a small machine that allows you to switch between several @doing
messages. The commands are:

        doings          - list all doing messages
        add <doing>     - add a new doing message to memory
        doing #         - select a certain @doing message



---------------------------- CODE ----------------------------------

@create Doing Machine<dm>=10
@Desc Doing Machine<dm>=%rThis is a small machine that allows you to
are:%r%r%tdoings%t%t- list all doing messages%r%tadd <doing>%t- add a
new doing message to memory%r%tdoing #%t%t- select a certain @doing message%r%r
&ADD_DOING Doing Machine<dm>=$add *:&DOING[v(num_doings)]
me=%0;&NUM_DOINGS me=add(1,v(num_doings));@pemit %#=You have just added
another @doing message.
&LIST_DOINGS Doing Machine<dm>=$doings:@pemit %#=The following @doing
messages have been stored:%r;@dolist lnum(v(num_doings))=@pemit %#=## -
[v(doing[##])]
&USE_DOING Doing Machine<dm>=$doing *:@switch v(doing[%0])=>"",@fo
%#=@doing [v(doing[%0])],@pemit %#=You do not have a @doing message set
for that number.
@set Doing Machine<dm>=INHERIT
&NUM_DOINGS Doing Machine<dm>=0

----------------- PRETTY LISTED VERSION ----------------------------

ADD_DOING:$add *:
        &DOING[v(num_doings)] me=%0;
        &NUM_DOINGS me=add(1,v(num_doings));
        @pemit %#=You have just added another @doing message.
LIST_DOINGS:$doings:
        @pemit %#=The following @doing messages have been stored:%r;
        @dolist lnum(v(num_doings))=@pemit %#=## - [v(doing[##])]
USE_DOING:$doing *:
        @switch v(doing[%0])=>"",@fo %#=@doing [v(doing[%0])],@pemit
%#=You do not have a @doing message set for that number.

Well thats it. Have fun!

By the way thanks you one and all for the great response to my

of the Pretty Lister.
