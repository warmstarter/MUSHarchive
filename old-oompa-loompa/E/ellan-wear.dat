DESC=+wear is a system to allow quick desc changes, using alternative text for your   garments (+wear) hair (+hair) mood (+mood) and special effects (+fx) by storing   favorite description text on an object you own, and revealing only the one you   select in your character description.  NOTE: This program requires an unformatter utility.
