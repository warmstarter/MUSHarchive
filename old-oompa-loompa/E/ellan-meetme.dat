DESC=+meetme was inspired by a similar global on mucks. The premise is the  same.. in a place where the majority of the rooms are publicly owned, and deliberately set not-jump-ok to preserve a sense of privacy and realism, nevertheless, it is useful for roleplay to be able to .invite.  people to where you are, and move them quickly 'onstage'. Unlike  jump_ok, no one will ever arrive without at least .one. party in the room knowing in advance.  NOTE: This program requires an unformatter utility.
