Javelin's "New Combat System", used on DuneMUSH. This is old
code and may no longer work - use it for ideas and inspiration.
If you base your combat system on this code or its algorithms or
ideas, please add a line of credit for the idea to Paul@DuneMUSH 
(aka Javelin) in your combat +help or news text.

The NCS is an attack/defense system. Attacker selects and attack
and defender is prompted to select a defense, and the system
determines the attack's effectiveness based on the combination 
of the two and some stats and some luck. Involves neat semaphore
use to do this.
