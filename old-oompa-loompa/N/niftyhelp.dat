DESC=+help is nearly universal on every MUSH I've seen, but there's no publically available system that I know of, so I thought I'd share mine. The system makes it extremely easy for any admin to add or remove help on a topic with a minumum of fuss, keeping the +help files up to date nicely. The system also supports submenus, to  keep your index from becoming cluttered. Feel free to use this and  modify it as you like, but please drop me a note to let me know if you like it, and especially if you find some nifty modification to it so I can upgrade it.
