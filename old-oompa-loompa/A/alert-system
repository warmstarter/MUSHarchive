ALERT alert alert/mute alert/hide [This is the general user's help file]
    This command enables you to set an alert to notify you when 
certain people log on or log off. This command cannot be used to 
track hidden or dark users. You will not receive alerts if you are 
set HAVEN.

    To add a person to your alert list, type: alert Username -- where 
'Username' is the name of the person you are adding to your alert 
list.
    To remove a person from your alert list, type: alert Username -- 
it's a toggle.
    To see who is on your alert list, type: alert -- with nothing following it.
    To mute the beeps and receive text-only alerts, type: alert/mute
    To hear beeps again, type: alert/mute -- it's also a toggle.
    To hide from whomever might be watching for you with alert, type: alert/hide
    To unhide, type: alert/hide -- it's also a toggle.


HIDE +hide +show  [The +ahelp file for the Admin only +hide command]
    This command allows people with the HIDE power to hide from the 
'who' and 'WHO' list. Hidden users can be seen by Royalty, 
Archangels, and people with SEE_ALL power, however ordinary users 
cannot see them unless they are in the same room with them, or they 
speak on a public chat channel or otherwise give away their presence 
-- it's hiding, not invisibility.

    To use, type: @hide/on
    To reappear on the who list, type: @hide/off
    To hide from a @channel/who that is hide_ok, type: @chan/hide 
channelname = yes
    To reappear on the @channel/who, type: @chan/hide channelname = no
    To hide from the alert list, type: alert/hide
    Or, to hide from everything at once, type: +hide
    To reappear all at once, type: +show
