Highly reccomended.%r%r[repeat(-,78)]

&FUN_BEEP_HELP Beeper Object=[center(Help for the +beep command,78,-)]%rThe +beep command is a way for player to give an alert to someone who's connected, and by their computer, but not paying attention to their connection to this MU*. The various options of the command are:%r[iter(sort({/on&Allow beeps by default|/off&Deny beeps by default|/on <player>&Always allow <player> to beep you|/off <player>&Always deny <player> to beep you|/help&This help message|/info&Tells you info about your beep setup|/setup&Setup the beep system on you|%%b<player>&Send a "wake up beep" to <player>|/clear&Clears everyone from your allow/deny lists|/clear <player>&Clears <player> from your allow/deny lists},a,|),%r%t+beep[ljust(before(##,&),20)][after(##,&)],|)]%r%rNote you might not need to +beep/setup before you can use it, that depends on the particular MU* you're on (they may do it for you in character creation).%r%rAlso note that if player name spaces aren't enabled, you can pass beep multiple names and it'll parse through them all. You can try this when player name spaces is defined, but you may get unperdictable results. Conclusion: Player name spaces are evil don't use them.%r[repeat(-,78)]
