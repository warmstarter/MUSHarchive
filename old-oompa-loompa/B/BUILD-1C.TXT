Step 1: Starting Off (#3871RFJnt)
Ok to get to this point with a builder you need to first @dig <the name of a
starting area on your planet>, once you do this it should tell you that <the
name you gave it> created with room number <a db#>. You then @tel <the db#>
that will bring you to this point.  For here follow the rooms and they will
give you step by step instructions on how to build and zone the planet's so
every thing will work with the space and combat codes :).

Ship Zoning Tutorial 
  There are four main types of useful ship objects: Ship Object, ZMO Parent,
Main Ship Zone, and Deck Zones.

Ship Object: An object that carries all the critical RP information, etc.
ZMO Parent: Handles all softcoded functions, contains crew, etc.
Main Ship Zones: Mainly a nameholder for rooms.
Deck Zones: Another nameholder for rooms.

Ship Zoning Tutorial: Part Two
  Here are all the things you should put on/in the objects:

Ship Object    --> &ZONES (List of all deck zones and main ship zone)
ZMO Parent     --> &ZONES (List of all deck zones and main ship zone)
Main Ship Zone --> Set this object AREA.
                   Place all the deck zones within this object.
                   &ZONES (List of all deck zones and main ship zone)
Deck Zones     --> &ROOM_LIST (List all of the rooms that are @chzone'ed to                       the deck zone)
                   &SHIP_OBJECT (DBREF of ship object)
                   &ZONES (List of all deck zones and main ship zone)

  In the example rooms, fictious names and databse numbers are used.

  This is the object that contains all the IC stuff (space, etc.). Builders
need not worry about placing info on this object, as it will be handled when
consoles are placed, etc.

  Any room that does not have any particular zone, like the turbolifts, place
the room(s) in the &ROOM_LIST attribute on this object.

  This is the place for the computer core (contact Radnor for info), and has
all the objects listed in ZONES as children (@parent each object to this one).
It also contains the attribute SHIP_OBJECT:

  That about wraps up the ship zoning tutorial. If you have any specific
questions, feel free to ask Radnor. If you have completed your ship zones and
rooms, @mail a note to Radnor telling him that you are ready to install the
computer core.
