After perusing Lydis'a eval functions, I said "Yes! Indeed!"  But then
another issue became apparent: a lengthy eval could bring a busy MUSH
to its knees.

I submit for your approval the "Building Inspector" that I build for
SwordsMUSH.  The criteria for which it inpects can be programmed in the
appropriate registers.

This is a "BY CYCLE", not an "EVAL", device.  It requires a couple of
cycles to check each object.  Because it is not nearly as elegant as
evals, I was not going to submit it.  BUT, it appears that the "Building
Inspector" can run CONCURRENTLY with an active MUSH and NOT jam the
queues or otherwise cause excessive lag.

I would LOVE any comments and criticisms -- email would be fine.
