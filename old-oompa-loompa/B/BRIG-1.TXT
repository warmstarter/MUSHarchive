@DESCRIBE Brig Controller Parent=This is the parent for a brig system which will lock prisoners in, but still allow others to come and go. To set it up, @create a brig controller, @parent it to this object. Set an attribute on it called MY_DOOR_NUMBER which contains the dbref of the exit *from* the brig to the outside. In order for it to work, both the controller and the door have to be on the zone for the ship (good building practice anyway).%r Type 'brighelp' for a list of commands.%r%r%t Coded by Cmdr_Slitkoh.
