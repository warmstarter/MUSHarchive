DESC="A large furry creature with plump tummy, soft fur, and cute little eyes.  It looks interested to see you, perhaps you should PET CAT."  Ten different actions can happen if you pet the cat, all of them different.  Will the cat scratch you? Will it let you rub its tummy? Will it pounce on a dust bunny?  Only Rand() will tell.
