MUX Core 1.0 Beta
http://code.google.com/p/muxcore/
-------------------------------------

This package has been tested to work with TinyMUX 2.7 and earlier. I
have not made efforts to test compatibility with other servers, and
I don't intend to at this time. I just don't have the experience with
other servers or the inclination to do it all myself. If someone out
there is interested in working on compatibility, more power to you!

PLEASE NOTE that MUXCore is intended to be installed as a fresh database
on a new install of a TinyMUX. There is no support for installing MUXCore
on top of an existing game. The system makes heavy changes to everything
from globals to the game config file, and trying to drop it in on top of
an existing configuration is asking for headaches.

I've had several questions about making pieces of the project available
individually without needing to install the whole system. This is difficult
because the system is highly integrated. For example, the room parent
looks for places, metarooms, views, and jnotes. The jnotes system and the
building tracker would not work without Anomaly Jobs. All systems rely on
the included global functions. Still, making the system available in pieces
is a goal for the 1.0 Release version of MUXCore. I'd also like to take
that as an opportunity to do better documentation for the separate code
systems, since the wiki documentation on Google Code just isn't working
for me!

Included Files
-------------------------------------
  * This Readme
  * MUXCORE-CHANGES
  * MUXCORE-SOURCE
  * Distribution files in the /game/ subfolder.
  
Installation the Fast and Easy Way
-------------------------------------
In Windows, unzip this file into your mux2.7 directory and allow it to
overwrite subdirectories. This will add the netmux.conf and mux.config
files, the Backup script, and the plushelp.txt, staffhelp.txt, and
jhelp.txt files as well as the flatfile backup of the database to the
appropriate folders.

1) Configure and compile TinyMUX
2) cd to mux2.7/data and delete all netmux.* files and *.db files that exist.
3) Use the db_load script for your distribution to load the flatfile
   as netmux.db.
4) If you wish to change your gamename and server port info, or 
   just take a look at the game options, cd back to mux2.7/game and
   edit netmux.conf.
5) Fire up your game and login as #1 with password "potrzebie". The
   default CodeWIZ and BuildWIZ characters have the same password, and
   you should @newpassword all three characters immediately. From there
   +help and +shelp can get you started.

Installation the Slow Way
-------------------------------------
Note that this install path WILL NOT WORK for people using the Windows
version of TinyMUX. The source install relies on being able to @restart
the server at certain stages of the install, which is not possible to do
gracefully using the Windows server.

1) Configure and compile TinyMUX
2) Remove the default netmux files as in step 2 above.
3) Edit your netmux.conf as you like, but with the following values:
   master_room #2
   access @function wizard
   access @function/privileged wizard
   function_invocation_limit 25000 (necessary for Anomaly Jobs)
   room_parent #45
   guest_char_num #61
4) Decide how you want to handle +help and +shelp (see below).
5) Start up the server and login at #1 with password 'potrzebie'.
6) Use your client to quote in the MUXCORE-SOURCE file with a one second
   delay between lines. The delay is necessary. Installation will take
   about twenty-five minutes. You'll be notified when installation is
   complete, and it will remind you to @newpassword #1, CodeWIZ, and
   BuildWIZ.

+Help File Considerations
-------------------------------------
The default case for MUX Core is to use the included softcoded +help
system. If you prefer the hardcoded help files, or just want to use
your own softcoded help system, these text-based files are actually
included in the "Easy Way" installation in addition to the softcoded
system, and are accessed with ++help and ++shelp.

You can remove these declarations in netmux.conf if you just want to
use the softcoded system, or you can nuke the objects associated with
the +Help commands (which are left separate from the main globals for
this exact reason) and change netmux.conf to let plushelp.txt and
staffhelp.txt use +help and +staff.

If you use the "Slow Way" installation and want to use the text-based
+help files, you'll need to grab plushelp.txt and staffhelp.txt from
the text subdirectory of the "Easy Way" tar.gz file. You may also want
to grab the jhelp.txt file for Anomaly Jobs while you're in there.
