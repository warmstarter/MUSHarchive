MUX Core 1.0 Alpha
http://code.google.com/p/muxcore/
-------------------------------------

This package has been tested to work with TinyMUX 2.7 and earlier. I
have not made efforts to test compatibility with other servers, and
I don't intend to at this time. I just don't have the experience with
other servers or the inclination to do it all myself. If someone out
there is interested in working on compatibility, more power to you!

Installation the Fast and Easy Way
-------------------------------------
The tar.gz file included in this distribution is a ./Backup file of a
bare bones installation of MUX Core on a fresh install of TinyMUX. By
far the easiest and fastest way to install MUX Core is:

1) Configure and compile TinyMUX
2) cd to mux2.7/data and enter "rm netmux.*"
3) Extract the tar.gz to your mux2.7/game folder.
4) cd to mux2.7/game and enter "tar zxvf muxcore1.0alpha.tar.gz"
5) Enter "cd data" and enter "./db_load netmux netmux.FLAT netmux.db"
   It is necessary to have removed the netmux.db, netmux.pag, and
   netmux.dir files from the base install, since db_load will not
   overwrite them. Step 2 takes care of this for you.
6) If you wish to change your gamename and server port info, or 
   just take a look at the game options, cd back to mux2.7/game and
   edit netmux.conf.
7) Fire up your game and login as #1 with password "potrzebie". The
   default CodeWIZ and BuildWIZ characters have the same password, and
   you should @newpassword all three characters immediately. From there
   +help and +shelp can help you out!

Installation the Slow Way
-------------------------------------
1) Configure and compile TinyMUX
2) Remove the default netmux files as in step 2 above.
3) Edit your netmux.conf as you like, but with the following values:
   master_room #2
   access @function wizard
   access @function/privileged wizard
   function_invocation_limit 25000 (necessary for Anomaly Jobs)
   room_parent #45
   guest_char_num #61
4) Decide how you want to handle +help and +shelp (see below).
5) Start up the server and login at #1 with password 'potrzebie'.
6) Use your client to quote in the source.txt file with a one second
   delay between lines. The delay is necessary. Installation will take
   about twenty-five minutes. You'll be notified when installation is
   complete, and it will remind you to @newpassword #1, CodeWIZ, and
   BuildWIZ.

+Help File Considerations
-------------------------------------
The default case for MUX Core is to use the included softcoded +help
system. If you prefer the hardcoded help files, or just want to use
your own softcoded help system, these text-based files are actually
included in the "Easy Way" installation in addition to the softcoded
system, and are accessed with ++help and ++shelp.

You can remove these declarations in netmux.conf if you just want to
use the softcoded system, or you can nuke the objects associated with
the +Help commands (which are left separate from the main globals for
this exact reason) and change netmux.conf to let plushelp.txt and
staffhelp.txt use +help and +staff.

If you use the "Slow Way" installation and want to use the text-based
+help files, you'll need to grab plushelp.txt and staffhelp.txt from
the text subdirectory of the "Easy Way" tar.gz file. You may also want
to grab the jhelp.txt file for Anomaly Jobs while you're in there.
