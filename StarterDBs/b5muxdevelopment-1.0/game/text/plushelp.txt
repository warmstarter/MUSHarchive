%ch1. What is an average attribute?%cn
        
We do not specify an average for anything.  Average is determined by what
most people buy.  To be safe, divide your attribute points by five (the
number of attributes) and that is "average."  Anything more than that is
above average, below it is below average.  If you MUST have some kind of
idea, 4 is about average.  No attributes are allowed over a value of 6.
    
%ch2. What is an average skill?%cn
    
As with attributes we do not specify an average.  It depends on what most
people buy.  Keep in mind most skills are relative (your PPG skill depends on
what your combat opponent's dodge skill is).  Also keep in mind that no skill
can be bought higher than your learn attribute. If you MUST have some kind of
idea, 4 is about average.  No skills are allowed over a value of 6.
%cy<Continued in +HELP CFAQ 2>%cn
            
&cfaq 2 
%ch3. Do I have to buy my native language?%cn
    
Yes.  Consider your skill points as being inflated so as to allow for this.
Average competence in a language is about 3 or so.
        
%ch4. What's the difference between ship piloting and just piloting?  What's
   the difference between any similiar skills like these?%cn
    
Our skills are setup in order from specific to general.  When you attempt to
perform something which uses a skill, it first checks the specific sill, then
checks each skill up the list to the most general.  The catch is that each
general skill has a penalty applied in accordance with how general it is.
Then the highest of them is chosen to apply.  So, general skills can be used
for more things, but they get a penalty applied.

&cfaq 3 
%ch5. Can a skill be increased later?%cn
    
Skills increase with use, but using a skill 50 times in 10 minutes gets you
no better improvement than using it once in 10 minutes.  Only specific skills
autoimprove.  The +TRAIN command (HELP +TRAIN) also exists to train people.
Please do not abuse this command by training people who either shouldn't have
a skill, automating +TRAIN or other forms of abuse.
        
%ch6. Can an attribute be increased later?%cn
         
No.
    
%ch7. What do you mean only specifc skills autoadvance?%cn
    
Whenever you do anything requiring a skill check, the specific skill is
increased.  If you fire a light PPG, but your highest relevant skill is in
firearms, it will use the value of firearms but it still increases light PPG
skill.  It will increase the skill even if you had a 0 in it before.

%ch8. Does the communications skill cover only ship communications?%cn
    
Yes.
    
%ch9. Is there a list of empire heads and how do I get a military job?%cn
        
Features and empire heads are found in NEWS AVAIL.  Empire heads are those
with * in front of their name.  Please do not ask if characters not listed
in NEWS AVAIL will become available later on or apply for them, as it will
just annoy the wiz staff and give them more work to do.

%ch10. Can I take alien skills?%cn
        
For the most part, no - it just isn't IC.  The only exception to this is
languages, which you can purchase at a level considerably below your native
skill level (3 below is a good guide).  This does not apply to First One
languages or languages of their servant races, which can not be purchased.
As with any other skills, you can only purchase them if you have a sufficient
IC reason that can be justified to the wiz staff.
%cy<Continued in +HELP CFAQ 5>%cn
        
&cfaq 5 
%ch11. Can I be a Vorlon or Shadow or non-B5 race?%cn
    
No.  Players are not allowed to be First Ones or their servant races, so
please don't even ask.  You are also not allowed to be non-B5 races.
    
%ch12. What do I do after chargen?%cn
    
See question 9 if you want a military character ot to be in one of the big
four empires (as opposed to being an independent trader).  If you want to be
an independent trader contact Valdar or JohnD.  If the situation is right, it
might be possible to get an IC loan and be a store owner, trader, corporate
CEO, etc.  Note that you will be expected to pay back your loan, and failure
to do so will cause you to lose your business and then some.

            %cgChapter 1: The Voices, the Voices!  Stop the Voices!%cn
No, we don't intend this tutorial to help you with the multiple personality
disorder or all those voices in your head.  The purpose is to help you out
with finding a job and dealing with empire recruiters and their recruiting
rooms.  The first thing you need to do as a part of character generation and
is decide which empire or organization to join.  Recruiting rooms exist off
the OOC hub and empire players are available to help you pick the right
empire for you, along with the various empire sections of the B5 MUX web page
at http://www.pcnet.com/~jdutka/b5/.
     
As a B5 MUX player, you need to carefully consider your decisions, especially
these initial ones.  Your choice of empire determines your race, which
determines to some small degree your background.  You need to think carefully
about your character's background, as you may only choose skills that are
justified by this background.  Note that you generally will not be able to
justify any skills not of your own race, ESPECIALLY Minbari skills, if you
are not a Minbari.  Also note that you are not allowed to purchase skills
belonging to the Vorlons, Shadows, or any of their servant races.  Once you
know this and have chosen an empire, you are ready to begin the process.
%cy<Continued in +HELP TUTORIAL2>%cn
        
&tutorial2
                     %cgChapter 2: Chargen Basics%cn
B5 MUX chargen, contrary to popular belief, is very simple.  You just select
priorities, select attributes, select skills, then go through a race exit to
select your race.  This is just part of the process, however.  On B5 MUX, we
value roleplay and so, you will need to carefully consider your choices as
the first step is choosing a race and considering what sort of jobs you would
like, generally after you speak with people from that empire or organization
so they can assign you to a job.  Once you choose an empire or organization,
that will dictate which race you must be.  For example, if you are in the
Minbari Federation, you MUST be a Minbari, only Narn may join the Narn
Regime, only Centauri may join the Centauri Republic, and only Humans may
join the Earth Alliance.  Note that any allowed race may join an independent
trading organization or reside on Babylon 5.
    
Now that you know your empire and race, you will need to spend some time
working on a good background for your character.  Where was he or she born,
what was the character's childhood and family like, what are his or her
likes, dislikes, motivations, good and bad points, skills and weaknesses, and
so on?  What has your character done as an adult, if he or she is an adult?
Questions like this are necessary to answer and flesh out, as they will help
you properly roleplay the character and figure out what skills he or she
should have, as ALL of your skills and attributes need to be justified by
this background, a background that must be in character with the Babylon 5
universe in the MUX's timeframe just before "Coming of Shadows" in early
season two.
%cy<Continued in +HELP TUTORIAL3>%cn
    
&tutorial3
Once you have done all this, you need to read through all of +HELP CHARGEN
very carefully, and remember to pay close attention to the room @descs in
the chargen process.  First you will need to type NEW in the first chargen
room to initialize your character for the process.  Note that considerable
thought and reading is required before starting to actually assign your
character's priorities, skills and attributes.  Thought is required on
Babylon 5 MUX, and unlike some of the other Star Trek and other themed games
out there, we encourage and reward those who would like to roleplay, as you
will generally get much further on our game through roleplay than you will
by combat, killing, and death.
    
                        %cgChapter 3: Priorities%cn
Once you have used the NEW command to initialize your character, you will
need to use the PRIORITIES command to select priorities for skills,
attributes, and wealth.  The order in which you select your priorities will
determine how many attribute and skill points you will be allocated for
purchase of those attributes and skills used to flesh out your character.
Once you have done that, use the continue exit to move on to the next step.
%cy<Continued in +HELP TUTORIAL4>%cn
        
&tutorial4
If you are going to be a military type or a part of one of our big four
empires (Minbari Federation, Narn Regime, Centauri Republic, and Earth
Alliance), you will probably want to assign wealth as your last priority, as
you will be drawing a salary from your supervisor, boss, or commanding
officer.  However, if you would like to be an independent trader and think
a few thousand extra credits would help you out, you may or may not want to
assign wealth to a higher priority.
    
                        %cgChapter 4: Attributes%cn
In the second step, you will use the ABUY and ASELL commands to select your
attribute levels.  Note that attributes combine in various ways to form
characteristics, which are used along with skill levels to determine base to
hit levels for actions using those skills.  Leaving any one or more attribs
too low or high will affect you down the road, and while you can do it to
create unique chars, it will have a price when you least expect it, as the
players with values of zero or greater than six have found out and so, are
not allowed.  If you need a number thrown out there by the wizard staff as a
typical average value for an attrib, evenly divide your attrib points among
the five player selectable attributes, and that is average for you.
%cy<Continued in +HELP TUTORIAL5>%cn
    
&tutorial5
Remember that attributes are a reflection of your character and, for example,
an intelligent type should have a higher learn, a larger or muscular type
should have a higher build, a quick and nimble type should have a higher
reflexes attribute, and so on.  If the wizard staff finds a player with a
description or +FINGER data that contradicts his or her stats, that player
will be asked to change the description and +FINGER data, not their stats,
since that would be the easier correction to make by far.  Note that you may
not purchase skills at a higher level than your learn attribute and the
chargen hardcode prevents this.  Now that you have allocated all of your
attribute points, it is time to pick skills.
        
                         %cgChapter 5: Skills%cn
Like attribs, skills are a reflection of your char and his or her background.
You should spend considerable time selecting the skills your character should
ICly have and every skill should be justified by your character's background.
Through the SBUY and SSELL commands in step two of chargen, you buy and sell
these skills until you are satisfied with the result and no longer have any
remaining skill points to use.  Remember that you should NOT purchase any
skills involving telepathy, the Vorlons, Shadows, or any of their servant
races, any skills belonging to the Minbari if you are not a Minbari, or
generally any skills not belonging to races other than your own.
%cy<Continued in +HELP TUTORIAL6>%cn
    
&tutorial6
Note that many players have asked what an average skill value is and an even
larger number of players seem to think that it is a good idea to purchase
a large number of skills all at level one.  To answer the first question, on
B5 MUX, as many skill checks are opposed skill rolls, in which sucess is
determined by sucessfully making a skill roll by a larger margin than your
opponent makes an accompanying skill roll, there is no real average skill
figure.  However, if you need a number thrown out for you, four is as average
as you'll ever see here on the MUX.  Four shows the typical level seen by
someone competent at that skill.  A level of one in a skill probably means
that, while you know a little about that skill, you really shouldn't be
trusted to sucessfully perform it.  A level of two means that you are a bit
better than level one, but still not that good at it, while a level of three
means that you are just about, but not quite, competent in the skill.  Levels
above five denote increasing levels of competence, with levels over
six generally never seen in the player character races.  If you have a skill
level over six, you'd better have an extremely good reason for it, as the
wizard staff will generally expect you to decrease that skill level in
ninety-nine percent of the cases.
%cy<Continued in +HELP TUTORIAL7>%cn
    
&tutorial7
Remember that you should only have skills that your player would ICly have,
according to his or her background, with the exceptions listed in this
tutorial.  These skills form who you are along with your roleplay sessions,
determining just what you can do in some instances and how well you do them.
Because of this, it is important that you spend some effort and considerable
thought in thinking the process through before actually buying the skills.
        
Note that feature chars are given a bonus of twenty skill points due to their
importance to the game, extra experience, and as a reward for successfully
applying for the char, and empire head feature chars are given a bonus of
thirty skill points.  In addition, in preparation for the addition of rules
for roleplaying telepaths, since the hardcode is quite some time off, every
player will be given a four skill point bonus for four dark secrets about
himself or herself, if approved by JohnD.  Note that those secrets need to
be negative ones, must agree with the character's background, and must be
sane and in line with the B5 universe in our timeframe right before the early
season two episode "Coming of Shadows."  This does not mean we will be
allowing telepaths soon, since the wizard staff does not expect to be
accepting telepaths any time soon, due to the number of bugs that need to be
fixed and new hardcode that needs to be added.
%cy<Continued in +HELP TUTORIAL8>%cn
    
&tutorial8
                          %cgChapter 6: Archetypes
In case you don't mind taking a generic stats template, an archetype
generator is available in the skills and attributes room of chargen also
known as the step two room.  It lists a small number of archetypes at the
moment, primarily trader and fighter pilot archetypes for the Narn, Centauri,
and Minbari races.  If you would like to suggest an archetype in character
with the Babylon 5 universe in our timeframe that would be used by a large
number of players, @mail JohnD with the skills you think that archetype would
have along with the archetype name, such as Narn Independent Trader.
    
To see a list of available archetypes, look at the archetype generator and
note the number of the archetype you desire.  Once you have located the
desired archetype, type ARCH <NUMBER>.  For example, if you would like to
use the Narn fighter pilot archetype, you would type ARCH 3.  Don't worry
about the number of messages sent to you and do not leave the room until the
messages have stopped for a minute or two.  After the messages have stopped
for a minute or two, you can type DONE and go through the continue exit if
your skill and attribute points have been completely used up.
%cy<Continued in +HELP TUTORIAL9>%cn
   
&tutorial9
                       %cgChapter 7: Race Selection
Note that when you are in the race selection room, it is important to do a
few things before actually selecting a race by walking through that race's
exit.  Before selecting a race, you need to spend time on a good @desc that
is free of spelling errors and that clearly describes you as completely as
possible in a description of fifteen or fewer lines, as any more will
generally scroll another player's screen when you include the list of objects
you are wielding, wearing, or grabbing.  You will then need to set yourself
opaque by typing @SET ME=OPAQUE and locking yourself by typing @LOCK ME=ME
and @ELOCK ME=ME.  After doing that, remember to fill out your +FINGER data,
with assistance being available in HELP +FINGER.  Once you do this, you are
ready to go on to the race selection step.
    
Race selection is extremely important, but is generally is not up to the
player to choose, as an empire is usually the first thing the player chooses,
and should be done before ever entering the character generation process.  On
B5 MUX, unlike with other games, each race has distinct characteristics and
racial modifiers unique to themselves and these manifest themselves in the
skills and attributes of players selecting each race.  Please do not ask
anyone, especially the wizard staff, about the specifics of these racial
modifiers, as the information is not available for players.  These modifiers
are intended to be applied to you if you select your skills and attribs as if
they never existed, and to do otherwise defeats the purpose of them existing.
%cy<Continued in +HELP TUTORIAL10>%cn
    
&tutorial10
After you are done selecting attribs and skills in step two of chargen and
have typed DONE, you are cleared to continue on to step three, also known as
the race selection step.  Once you are there, you need to step through the
exit corresponding to the empire you picked before even entering the chargen
process.  Once you do this, you will be set up and sent to a central location
on your race's homeworld.  You will then need to contact your empire head or
his/her designated second and ask him/her for the job/jobs you desire or ask
which jobs are available at the time.  You'll need to @mail Wint for the
Earth Alliance, Delenn and Shakiri for the Minbari Federation, T'Bar for the
Narn Regime, and Turhan for the Centauri Republic, asking them to check with
JohnD if you'd like to start off on the B5 station.
        
If you would like to be an independent trader on your own and not answering
to the economic ministries of the empires, you will need to read NEWS GUIDE
several times until you know the building rules by heart, go to the Babylon 5
MUX economy web page and select a non-military cargo vessel design belonging
to your race and aim for the smaller designs, as indie traders really can't
afford anything other than the smallest models.  You will then need to pick a
name for your ship and go to your race's economy ministry head or ask your
empire head for the name of that minister and take out a loan to pay for that
ship and enough spending money to get you started.  Once you are granted that
loan, you need to @mail JohnD to let him know that you have read NEWS GUIDE
enough to know the building rules by heart and list your ship's class and
name so he can allocate enough building quota.  You should also include in
your @mail to JohnD the name of the player loaning you the money and how much
money you were loaned.
%cy<Continued in +HELP TUTORIAL11>%cn
   
&tutorial11
                 %cgChapter 8: Advanced Chargen Concepts
The purpose of this chapter is to discuss advanced concepts and tricks in
the B5 MUX chargen process and discuss possible future features of the
system.  The whole idea of chargen is to work on a good background in line
with your character and the B5 universe in our time frame, which happens to
be in early season two right before the episode "Coming of Shadows."  Once
you have a background, the purpose of chargen is to flesh out that background
and fill it in through the proper selection of attribs and skills.  If that
is done well, your roleplaying experience here on B5 MUX will be enhanced
that much more through the successful integration of roleplay and the skill
hooks built into our MUX's hardcode features.
    
Our skill system has one unique feature where if you use a certain skill, it
automatically improves and adds experience points to your availability pool.
Note that while use of a skill improves that skill, the skill can only be
improved so many times per hour, with the current time being ten or thirty
minutes, if I remember right.  Also, B5 MUX is rather unique in having a
skill tree system, where each skill starts off at the root parent skill and
branches out into more and more specific skills as you go from root to trunk
to branch to branchlet to twig.
%cy<Continued in +HELP TUTORIAL12>%cn
    
&tutorial12
For example, Piloting is a root skill that is a parent to Narn Piloting,
which itself is a parent to Narn Fighter Piloting.  For example, say you have
Piloting at level two, Narn Piloting at level three, and Narn Fighter
Piloting at level one and you perform an action in your Narn Frazi class
heavy fighter that requires a Narn Fighter Piloting skill check.  Since there
is a penalty of one per level more general you go down the skill tree, this
will mean the roll will be made with a Narn Fighter Piloting effective skill
level of one, a Narn Piloting effective skill level of three minus one which
equals two, and a Piloting effective skill level of two minus two which
equals zero.  The code then selects the most favorable of those effective
skill levels, which would be two for the Narn Piloting skill.  Note that
while the Narn Piloting skill effective level would be used, you would be
performing an action that uses the Narn Fighter Piloting skill, so that skill
would be the only one automatically improved.
    
Future plans for chargen and the skills system include a command to teach
someone skills you own, telepath commands and advantages, which are similar
to the MechWarrior 2nd Edition system, much like the rest of our chargen
system.  Please do not ask the wizard staff if you could apply to be a
telepath, when telepath code will be added, or when telepath apps will be
accepted, as this is not planned for a very long time so much more important
bugs and new hardcode can be handled.
%cy<Continued in +HELP TUTORIAL13>%cn
    
&tutorial13
To end this tutorial, remember that your attribs and skills are a reflection
on who your character is and as such, need to all be completely justified by
your character's background.  Because of this, you should not select skills
belonging to alien races with the exception of one or two very low level
languages if those languages are completely justified by your background.
Note that this means the language must be level one or at most, if you are
very familiar with it, level two, assuming that you purchase your native
tongue AND any appropriate dialect or dialects of your native tongue at level
three or more.  Note that you may not purchase the Minbari skill unless you
are a Minbari and you may not pick any Vorlon, Shadow, Vorlon-Shadow servant
race skill, or any non-language skill belonging to another race.

When you connect to B5 MUX you actually do not have a player, you have a
character.  Character generation (CG) is the process that actually creates a
player character (PC).  Every character must go through character generation
to participate in RP activities.
     
Here we will detail character generation.  We define the terms used, cover
the concepts behind, and detail the interactions of component parts.  This
document is meant to be comprehensive but attempts to be brief for
expediency's sake.  Still, you'll find this to be a considerable document, it
must be to properly cover this crucial subject.

character using the NEW command.  Next, you must set your priorities.
PRIORITIES chooses which of three categories you wish to place the most
importance on, the categories are: attributes (1), skills (2), money (3).
  
The next step is to buy attributes and skills.  This process takes
considerable time and requires the diligent preparation.  Carefully consider
what attributes and skills to buy and in what amounts before entering
character generation (See "Step 1: Preparation" below).  Do not take this
process lightly.
  
Once you finish buying attributes and skills you must choose a race.  The
race choice greatly affects your RP experience.  We strongly suggest reading
the background race material before choosing a race.

Step 1: Preparation
  
First things first, prepare.  You will have a far easier time during
character generation and, as a result, a far better experience on B5 MUX if
you prepare for character generation extensively.  Before you begin, read
this entire document.  Also, we strongly suggest you read the background
material for each race B5 MUX supports, this will influence your choices of
attributes and skills, as well as, essentially, determine your RP experience
on B5 MUX.
  
The appendices contain detailed descriptions for each attribute and skill.
Additionally, we've included structured tables to allocate attribute and
skill points before actually going through the process.  The entire character
generation process, including preparation, generally takes 1 hour 45 minutes
to two hours.  The more you prepare the faster the actual process will go.

%ch%cy=============================================================================%cn
Every time you go through the character generation process you must type NEW.
If you have never done character generation before, %ch%cgNEW%cn creates and
initializes a new character DB entry: the character DB stores your
attributes, skills, race, and other RP information.
      
If you have already completed  character generation, %ch%cgNEW%cn completely
and irrevocably wipes your existing DB.  All attribute and skills settings
will be lost forever: you are starting over!  You will have no money, no
experience modifiers, and no racial modifiers when the NEW command
initializes your character.  Do not redo your character unless you are
absolutely sure.
     
Note, you can keep going through character generation so long as you DO NOT
choose a race.  Once you choose a race, you are set, and need to get it right
before picking that race.

%ch%cy=============================================================================%cn
Next, set your %ch%cgPRIORITIES%cn.  This is done with the %ch%cgPRIORITIES%cn command.
priorities establish which of three categories you value most.  There is no
right or wrong set, rather, these establish the type of character you want to
play.  To set your priorities you type:
  
%ch%cgpriorities%cn <FIRST PRIORITY> <SECOND PRIORITY> <THIRD PRIORITY>
  
Where <FIRST PRIORITY>, <SECOND PRIORITY>, and <THIRD PRIORITY> are chosen
from the following:
  
     1  -  Attributes
     2  -  Skills
     3  -  Money
  
For example: %ch%cgpriorities%cn 1 2 3
  
Indicates your priorities are attributes first, skills second, and money
third.  You receive the most purchase points for attributes, somewhat less
for skills, and money will receive the remainder.  The system does not have a
set number of points for each character, meaning it doesn't have 500 points
total, which are divided up based on your priorities.  There is a formula
that figures the values.
  
%cy<Continued in +HELP STEP 2 3>%cn
  
&step 2 3
Attributes are defined as intrinsic characteristics.  Often called talents or
"god-given-gifts" they are partially dictated by your race.  (See "Step 5:
Choosing a Race" below).  The attributes are: (1) build, (2) intuition, (3)
reflexes, (4) learning, (5) charisma.  The attributes will determine how
effective some skills are.  For example, you choose the skill unarmed combat,
yet you allocate only 1 point to both build and reflex attributes.  You can
practice all you like and purchase all the combat skills you like, but if
you're a weak klutz you still will be less capable than average.
  
The translation is this: prepare before choosing and realize there are always
tradeoffs.  No one can be best at everything.
%cy<Continued in +HELP STEP 2 4>%cn
  
&step 2 4
Skills are learned abilities modified both by attributes and by race.  You
can attempt to learn anything you want, but you might not be capable.  For
example, if you try and purchase telepathic skills but you do not belong to a
telepathy capable race, you have wasted your skill points on something you
can not use.  Note that there is no compensation for buying skills your race
can not use.  Again, preparation will greatly assist you in avoiding such
conflicts.
  
Finally, there's money.  Money is actual RP econ money in your race's
denomination.  Money is converted to the correct denomination when you choose
a race, the last step in the character generation process.
  
What do you want to put first, second, and third and why?  That depends on
what you consider most important.  Consider a few logical principles before
going any further.  Attributes are something that you can never alter.  They
are set in stone, unalterable save by massive intervention (e.g., you lose a
few limbs, that's going to affect build and reflexes).
%cy<Continued in +HELP STEP 2 5>%cn
  
&Step 2 5
As noted, skills are influenced by attributes.  If you have a low attribute
score it might either mitigate or obliterate any gains from buying more of a
skill, just like real life.  It can be argued that, if you are talented and
skilled you can always make more money.  However, if you plan to be a free
trader from the beginning, you might need money more then anything.
    
After setting priorities, you need to buy your attributes and skills.  You
can generate archetypical characters using the archetype generator.  This
simplifies the process, allowing you to first generate an archetype then
modify the character to your liking.  The archetype generator is available in
the skills and attributes room, so remember to take a look at it.

%ch%cy=============================================================================%cn
Step 3: Buying Attributes
  
The next step is to buy both your attributes and skills: buying means you
must make decisions and tradeoffs.  Setting your priorities issues you an
amount of points to buy attributes and skills.  You must use all those points
before moving on to choose your race.
  
First, you must buy attributes using the allocated attribute points (AP).
Character generation determines the number of attribute points based on your
priorities.  In the ongoing example above, by setting the attributes first
priority, I might receive 20 attribute points to purchase attributes.  Those
20 APs can be allocated completely to one attribute or evenly between all 5,
whatever you want.  The available attributes are:
%cy<Continued in +HELP STEP 3 2>%cn
      
&step 3 2
1) Build -  This is your physical build.  It includes strength (physical
     ability to lift something or carry a burden), constitution (how
     resistant to wear and tear your body is), and stamina or endurance (how
     long you can sustain physical activity before tiring and becoming
     ineffectual).
      
2) Intuition -  Intuition is influenced by experience.  It is the ability to
     recognize a situation and abstract from learned experience at a level
     below conscience considerations.  Using intuition you are not thinking
     "What do I do now?"  Rather, you, are reacting.
      
3) Reflexes -  This indicates how fast your react to external stimuli.  It
     applies to both physical and mental reactions to outside influences.
    
4) Learning -  Your ability to pick up new skills is greatly influenced by
     your ability to learn.  If you can not learn, it is logical you can not
     know how to do anything new.  Notably, no skill can exceed your learn
     attribute.  If, for example, you allocate 5 attribute points to learn,
     then you can allocate no more than 5 skill points to any one skill.
          
5) Charisma -  Often thought of as the ability to convince or influence
     people, this also includes physical attractiveness, a person's ethereal
     presence, body language, confidence, and their audible voice.
%cy<Continued in +HELP STEP 3 3>%cn
  
&step 3 3
You buy attributes one attribute at a time using the %ch%cgABUY%cn command in
the format:
  
%ch%cgABUY%cn <ATTRIBUTE NUMBER>
  
Where <ATTRIBUTE NUMBER> is one of the above attribute numbers (i.e., 1, 2,
3, 4, or 5).
  
When buying attributes, consider how they influence your skills.  All
attributes influence skills in some way.  When the system determines your
success or failure, it executes a formula that considers attribute ability,
skill ability, and random chance (the universe always incorporates chance).
You might wish to have a strong learn attribute so you can pick up higher
level skills.  If the skills you wish to buy are combat skills, then consider
placing some stress on the build attribute.
%cy<Continued in +HELP STEP 3 4>%cn
  
&step 3 4 
Further, consider the type of character you wish to play.  Is that character
a shrewd business type?  Is that character a fierce Minabari warrior?  Those
decisions will determine the types of allocation decisions.
  
If you find you bought an attribute above what you wanted, you can ASELL an
attribute:
  
ASELL <ATTRIBUTE NUMBER>
  
This sells back, a point at a time, <ATTRIBUTE NUMBER> where <ATTRIBUTE
NUMBER> corresponds to the attributes numbers above.  You can then buy more
of another attribute.

%ch%cy=============================================================================%cn
Step 4: Buying Skills
  
After you have finished allocating all attribute points, you must buy skills.
Skills are learned abilities.  Your priority rankings from step 2 determines
how many skill points you receive to allocate.  However, unlike attributes,
skills are completely learned and you will have the ability to not only
increase them but also earn new ones.
  
What skills can you choose?  The complete list of skills presently supported
by B5 MUX can be found in Appendix 3 at the end of this guide.  From that
list, you cannot use any skills related to the Vorlons, Shadows, First Ones,
or any of their helper races.  All systems use player skill and attribute
hooks, thus the system supports skills and attributes for NPC races.  Upon
choosing a race the character generation system automatically adds in the
racial modifiers for attributes, and realize that if you are found to have
any NPC related skills, they will be removed without compensation.
%cy<Continued in +HELP STEP 4 2>%cn
  
&step 4 2
To buy a skill you use the %ch%cgSBUY%cn command in the format:
  
%ch%cgSBUY%cn <SKILL NUMBER>
  
Where <SKILL NUMBER> corresponds to the number of a skill listed in appendix
3 at the end of this guide.
  
See +HELP SKILLS LIST for a complete and comprehensive listing of all
available skills.
  
How do you choose which skills to buy?  Babylon 5 rarely allows you to use
skills applicable to another race.  For example, if you become an Earth
Alliance member, it would be highly unlikely to every pilot a Minabari
fighter.  You are, obviously, free to purchase any listed skill.  We strongly
suggest you concentrate on skills directly applicable to the type of
character you wish to play AND directly applicable to the race you want to be.
%cy<Continued in +HELP STEP 4 3>%cn
  
&Step 4 3
The skill system works on a hierarchy ranging from broad categories to very
specific skills.  For example, personal combat includes competencies (skills)
applying to "Pole Weapons."  You can choose a general ability at pole weapons
by buying that skill.  However, if you plan on playing a Minbari warrior,
purchase the more specific "Minbari Pole Weapons" skill.  By choosing a more
specific skill, you increase your chances of success, more general skills
give you unspecified abilities.  In general, plan out your character and
choose the most specific skills available.
    
If you change your mind about buying a particular skill, you can sell back
skill points one at a time using SSELL:
  
SSELL <SKILL NUMBER>
  
Where <SKILL NUMBER> matches the number of the skill you wish to sell back.
You now can use SBUY to purchase another skill.
 
Finally, before you move on, type %ch%cgDONE%cn.  This tells the system you
are ready to choose a race.
%cy<Continued in +HELP STEP 5>%cn

%ch%cy=============================================================================%cn
Step 5: Choosing a Race
  
The final step, the step that completes the player generation process, is
choosing a race.  Please carefully consider this decision.  After you choose
a race you are locked into that choice.  To change you must create a wholly
new character with a wholly new name.  Upon choosing a race, player
generation will apply racial modifiers to your attributes and skills and
convert your money to the correct denomination.
  
Even more importantly, however, is how race choice affects your RP
experience.  For example, Minabri are a very structured and ritualized
society, where the Humans) are rather chaotic, informal, and unpredictable:
before starting player generation you should already have decided your race,
basing attribute and skill purchasing on that decision.  Carefully read the
background information provided for each race before making your decision.
Once again, you can not change once you set your race without creating a
completely new character.
      
An additional consideration is, if you are Human, Centauri, Narn, or Minbari,
you must join that empire (the player generation system automatically
associates you with that Empire and sets your race).  Choosing a race of the
League Of Non-Aligned Worlds associates you with the League of Non-Aligned
Worlds.

(1) Athletic: Unarmed Combat
    The player with this skill has undergone training in unarmed combat
    techniques.  The character's skill level determines the BTH number in
    unarmed combat, meaning combat without a weapon of any sort.  Though
    unarmed combat is, technically, "the art of self-defense," instructors
    often include training in the use of brass knuckles or other particularly
    nasty forms favored by street fighters in shadier zones.
  
    Unarmed combat includes training in martial arts favored by Minbari
    warriors and other such disciplines.  Minbari warriors should probably
    purchase this skill, while assassins, thieves, and military infantry
    might benefit from Unarmed Combat.

(1) Athletic: Unarmed Combat
    The player with this skill has undergone training in unarmed combat
    techniques.  The character's skill level determines the BTH number in
    unarmed combat, meaning combat without a weapon of any sort.  Though
    unarmed combat is, technically, "the art of self-defense," instructors
    often include training in the use of brass knuckles or other particularly
    nasty forms favored by street fighters in shadier zones.
      
    Unarmed combat includes training in Martial Arts favored by Minbari
    warriors and other such disciplines.  Minbari warriors should probably
    purchase this skill, while assassins, thieves, and military infantry
    might benefit from Unarmed Combat.

(2) Mental: Computer
    This skill gives the character a working knowledge of computer systems,
    basic operations, and programming.  When attempting a complex task such
    as searching a large database or writing a new program, the character
    must make a skill roll.  A difficulty modifier is assigned as is
    appropriate to the complexity of the task, the time available to complete
    it, and the hardware and software the character is using.  A character
    with this skill can both prevent and accomplish computer theft and
    similar intrusions into databases or computer-operated security systems.  Anyone
    attempting to gain unauthorized access into a protected system uses the
    Computer skill.  The "159) Mental: Cryptography" and "160) Mental:
    Security Systems" skills, coupled with this skill, determine success or
    failure circumventing and defeating computer security.
  
    Finally, this skill does affect your ability to successfully research new
    technologies, as the Babylon 5 universe makes copious use of computer
    simulation for such endeavors.
  
    If you plan to play a character who might need to break into computers,
    program them, perform research and development into new technologies,
    and/or fix complex systems, you ought to consider purchasing this skill.

(33) Mental: Language
    This skill confers upon the player knowledge of a specific language.
    There are a considerable number of languages, but those used by the
    Vorlons, Walkers, Shadows, or servants of those races such as Drakh,
    Zenerian and Red Monk, are not to be purchased by players, for obvious
    reasons.  Any player found buying those languages will have those skills
    removed without compensation.  Also, if you purchase a language used by
    an extinct race or a race other than your own, you should have an
    exceptional and acceptable explanation for your ability in that language
    when asked for one by any of the wiz staff.  A list of all the available
    languages would be prohibitively long, so can be found in the character
    generation help files.  Languages belonging to extinct races include
    Dilgar, Ikarran, Varnian, and Xon.  Also note that the Minbari language
    is broken up into three dialects: Lennau (warrior caste), Vik (worker
    caste), and Adronato (religious caste).
  
    Purchase the Language skill for your empire.  It is generally not good to
    purchase a Language skill for another race; however, if you plan on
    playing a character that requires frequent subterfuge, impersonation,
    diplomacy, or must exist in hostile foreign territories, then you might
    wish to purchase a Language skill for another race, just at a low level.
  
    Characters such as assassins, spies, and diplomats might benefit from
    language skills of other races.  Do not purchase a language skill for
    the Shadows, Vorlons, Walkers, other First Ones, or their servants, as
    these will automatically be zeroed without compensation, as will any
    language skill other than that of your own race, should acceptable
    justification not be provided.

&124
(124) Mental: Perception
    Someone with this skill is a trained observer.  A successful skill roll
    may reveal details that might otherwise be unnoticed and this skill is
    often used for such tasks as conducting a search or eavesdropping.  The
    skill is useful in a variety of circumstances, possibly used to determine
    who sees an approaching enemy first or to find out if a warrior notices
    that someone has tampered with the circuitry in his cockpit or perhaps
    determining you are on the receiving end of a lock-on.  Perception can
    also overcome an opponent's Stealth (18) skill roll.  Note that a high
    Perception skill does not substitute for roleplaying.

(125) Mental: Appraisal
    A player with this skill can recognize and identify items with some
    intrinsic value.  Appraisal also helps determine the best place to buy or
    sell the commodity in question.  If the skill roll fails, it means that
    the character either identified the item incorrectly or misjudged its
    value.  The extent of the error depends on the margin by which the roll
    fails and the coder's discretion.  A rule of thumb is plus or minus 5%
    per point by which the roll fails.  Knowing a commodity's value does not
    mean the character will get full value for it when he tries to sell it or
    that he will able to purchase it at its true worth.  Negotiation skill is
    used to determine the actual selling or purchase price.  For example, a
    player wants to buy some gemstones to sell on the Drazi homeworld.  He
    asks to look at some of the merchandise and tries to appraise it.  He
    misses his roll by 3, and so, the player is told by the NPC/puppet/
    TRADEROOM that the value is 15% more or less, which is randomly chosen as
    +15% - a 1000 credit gemstone seem to be worth 1150 to the player.  He
    could then use the Negotiation skill to get a better price for the item
    when he actually buys it.  Also, say a player wants to buy a second cargo
    carrier for his merchant business.  He checks out the ship and misses an
    Appraisal roll by 4 points, resulting in an overestimation by 20%.  The
    ship, really worth 200 million credits, is now worth 240 million, in the
    player's eyes.
  
    Purchase this skill you if you will be doing copious trading.  Free
    traders especially need to seriously consider purchasing this skill.
    This skill is less important to most individuals operating in the
    bureaucracies of the major empires.

(126) Mental: Administration
    The player with this skill knows the basic management and accounting
    techniques necessary to run a business.  The character must make a skill
    roll on a quarterly basis or as determined by the wizard staff to
    determine his efficiency or when dealing with a crisis.  An exceptional
    margin of success indicates increased productivity.  Failure indicates
    some form of mismanagement resulting in reduced productivity.  Characters
    who have purchased a trade ship or business may find this skill useful,
    as it may help them achieve a bit more financial security given wiz
    generosity and good skill rolls.  The Bureaucracy, Negotiation, and
    Scounge skills are all useful compliments to this skill.  The timely and
    appropriate use of any of these three should provide a useful modifier to
    the character's Administration skill roll.  For example, all merchants,
    business owners, etc. have to make a check against their Administration
    skill every pay period.  With success, make a bonus to their income
    depending on their margin of success.  With failure, they make less than
    average, the depends on the margin of failure.
  
    This skill is broken up into more specific categories of military,
    commercial, and criminal administration.  The sub-categories confer the
    expertise within their own race.  Each culture has different values and
    precepts that widely differ, thus your training and proficiency applies
    especially to your race.  However, because Babylon 5 is a very extensive

(130) Mental: Alternate Identity
    This skill means a character has created an alternate identity that will
    not be discovered under normal circumstances.  If, however, the character
    makes some blunder that reveals his alternate identity to others in the
    course of the adventure, his cover is automatically blown.  A skill roll
    is required whenever the character is being investigated or his alternate
    ID is called into question.  If the roll is successful, the alternate
    identity holds up.  If the roll fails, the examiner discovers some flaw
    that reveals the character's true identity.  Any character who wishes to
    infiltrate an enemy camp on a long term basis will need this skill,
    especially if he must deceive other players in the group, but is not
    needed if the character only needs to establish a temporary identity for
    a quick undercover run.  If, however, that identity is later expanded to
    have an independent life of its own, the player must purchase this skill
    if his character expects the new identity to hold up under scrutiny.  For
    example, say a pirate band wants to infiltrate a merchant into the
    Centauri homeworld.  He will have to make a roll against his Alternate
    Identity skill, plus every so often, to avoid discovery.
  
    Purchase this skill if you plan to play a spy, assassin or even mercenary
    character.  Several skills complement this skill, including: "131)

    have STRONG justification approved by the wizzes for having that skill.

(150) Mental: Disguise
    A player with this skill can change his appearance enough to be taken for
    someone else.  To create or pierce a disguise also requires a skill roll.
    This skill includes a full knowledge of cosmetics and what is fashionable
    in the various levels of society.  Under optimum conditions, creating a
    disguise requires access to specialized equipment such as makeup, contact
    lenses, and costume pieces such as platform shoes or padded clothing.
    Improvised disguises are possible, but with a significant penalty.  Note
    that the ability to make oneself look like someone else does not confer
    the ability to act like that person.  The impersonation skill needed to
    mimic voices and mannerisms is often used in conjunction with the
    Disguise skill.  Disguise also complements alternate identity quite well,
    allowing the new identity to have a different appearance.  The Disguise
    skill is subdivided into Earth, Minbari, Narn, Centauri, Vorlon, Shadow,
    and Miscellaneous.  %chSince this is a general skill, you should not

&158
(158) Mental: Demolitions
    A player with this skill can set and/or disarm explosive devices and has
    a working knowledge of explosives and their applications.  A character
    must make a skill roll for any demolition task ranging from determining
    the kind and quantity of explosive it takes to open a safe without
    destroying its fragile contents to the construction of a time bomb.  This
    skill can also be used to inspect the site of an explosion to discover
    the type of detonator and explosive used.  Setting a trap requires a
    Demolitions skill roll.  The difficulty modifier varies with the
    sensitivity of the explosive used and the complexity of the triggering
    device.  In general, the harder it is to set a device, the harder it is
    to disarm.  If the character setting the device fails his skill roll, he
    must make a second roll using the same modifiers to avoid setting off the
    device accidentally.  Characters may also use this skill to disarm
    explosive devices, including bombs, mines or other booby traps they may
    encounter.  Disarming these devices is a difficult and dangerous
    endeavor.  The character must make a skill roll with higher difficulty
    modifiers.  Failure means the character has set off the device, with the
    obvious consequences.

&159
(159) Mental: Cryptography
    A player with this skill can decode and encode messages.  When a
    character encodes a message, he makes a skill roll to determine success
    or failure.  A skill roll is required to decode a message without the
    encoding key.  As decryption is a time-consuming process usually aided by
    computers, the difficulty modifier should be based on the length of the
    message, the time the character has to decode the message, and the kind
    of equipment he is using.  Even with computers, decoding usually takes at
    least an hour.  If the skill roll fails, double the time required for
    every point for which the roll failed.  This skill determines how much of
    an intercepted message is decoded and how fast the decoding occurs.
  
    If you plan to play a character in military intelligence, a spy, assassin
    or other unsavory characters, consider purchasing this skill.

    includes knowledge of the various electronic lock picking devices needed
    to circumvent the locks and safes common in the B5 universe.  Note that
    this skill does not include an understanding of explosives or demolition.
    Demolition skill is, however, sometimes used in conjunction with Security
    Systems when the more subtle approach fails.

    for his empire.  The margin of success will determine how quickly the
    research can be completed.  Failure will generally mean loss of the time,
    energy, and money spent to perform the research.  An Engineering skill
    roll occurs whenever trying to research something.  Success means success
    at a speed determined by the margin of success in the Engineering skill
    roll and failure could mean loss of the money spent on the research and
    failure after an amount of time, all depending on the margin of failure
    of the Engineering skill roll.  This skill is subdivided into specialties

    high margin of error indicating that the character passed on
    misinformation to his student, who could actually end up losing points
    for that skill if he already has it.  Note that a character must possess
    a skill to teach it and a trainer can not train a player so that the
    trainee's skill level is above that of the person doing the training.
    Training is subdivided into the categories of military, civilian,
    religious, telepathic, and criminal training.  Note that all telepathic
    skills are forbidden and players can not buy them until the time we allow
    telepaths and, even then, only once the player has submitted a telepath
    application that has been accepted by a B5 MUX wizard.  %chSince this is

    A character with this skill can attempt to obtain information from a

    characters, making a skill roll to determine whether he is able to
    extract the desired information.  Modifiers should reflect the loyalty
    and willpower of the subject and the techniques the interrogator is
    willing to use.  If he uses more ruthless methods, a failed skill roll
    could mean the subject dies before the interrogator can extract any
    useful information.  Whatever the case, use only a single skill check to
    resolve the entire interrogation process.  This skill is broken up into
    chemical, telepathic, and physical interrogation.  Note that all

    A character with this skill has a knack for acquiring materials that are
    normally difficult to obtain.  This skill assumes the char has a network
    of contacts able to help him locate whatever he requires and that he is
    adept at uncovering existing networks or establishing new ones wherever
    he goes.  Locating a desired commodity or service often requires an
    exchange of favors or other materials and becomes a kind of chain
    reaction throughout the network.  Locating a desired commodity requires a
    skill roll.  Modifiers may be assigned based on the value and rarity of
    the desired commodity, the time the scavenger has for his work, and how
    well-established is his network in the area.  Eventually, a scavenger
    will be able to find what he is looking for unless the GM decides it is
    not available.  A failed skill roll means the commodity is not available
    in the immediate area, but does not rule out off-planet shipments or
    black-market contacts.  Note that Scrounge skill doesn't help the
    character buy the commodity at a good price.  Once he locates the term
    sought, the character needs Negotiation skills for haggling.  This skill
    is broken up into military, civilian, religious, and criminal scrounge.

Every system on Babylon 5 MUX is written to support role play in the Babylon
5 universe.  Space, economy, character combat, skills, and others all exist
to support role play.  However, to document all those systems as a single
corpus would only confuse everyone involved, thus, some systems are covered
in this role play guide.
  
The role play guide will cover character communication system (CCS), personal
combat system (PCS), skills and attributes in role play, and others issues
not covered in other guides.  The guide is comprehensive for the areas it
covers, making it the definitive source for that area.

%ch%cy=============================================================================%cn
Role play is B5 MUX's reason for being.  We have spent considerable time and
effort making sure B5 MUX has the absolute best subsystems possible.  The
systems are designed to be integrated, comprehensive, and playable.  The idea
is they exist to support role play not hinder or dictate it.
  
On any role play game the systems always support the thematic particularities
of that universe, for us that means Babylon 5's space, econ, personal combat,
and character communications.  Many are familiar with other TinyMU*s, one of
the most common problems on those games happens to be communications.  The
TinyMU* servers were designed to allow many forms of communications, but,
frequently, these methods are neither realistic nor appropriate for the
game's theme.
%cy<Continued in +HELP RP OVERVIEW2>%cn
  
&rp overview2
To address this, a comprehensive character communication system (CCS),
designed by Valdar, assures that communications will be IC (In-character).
The system does not allow unfair long-distance communications, does not work
when you are not set IC, and disallows using page, whisper, and TinyMUX
channels when set IC.  The system is designed, however, to be flexible and
fast.
  
 One of the things that makes the Babylon 5 universe so interesting is the
personal interactions of the show.  Unlike other Sci-Fi series, B5 does not
shy away from the rough stuff.  It is not unusual for a lead character to get
physically beaten up, robbed, or otherwise assaulted.  Indeed, this is a very
realistic outgrowth of being prominent: someone, somewhere is not going to
like you!
%cy<Continued in +HELP RP OVERVIEW3>%cn
  
&rp overview3
To address those instances when life more dangerous moments arise, B5 MUX
supports a "MUD-esque" personal combat system (PCS).  PCS ranges from Unarmed
combat (no weapons at all) to armed combat using clubs, staffs, pipes,
swords, knives, and others.  For example, Minbari warriors carry the Minbari
fighting staff.
  
Finally, the subsystems include skill and attribute hooks.  Skill and
attribute hooks allow the various subsystems to compute a probability of
success for some action you character attempts, ranging from armed personal
combat to haggling with a NPC about the price of tea on Minbar.  Without
skills and attributes, an extensive network of ubiquitous role play judges
with differing prejudices and reading speeds would decide all outcomes.  That
does not work on a 24 hour game where on unattended RP must exist!

All IC communications must occur either face-to-face or using CCS.  This
system includes many parts which work in concert to facilitate and excite RP.
Babylon 5's universe encompassed enormous distances dividing diverse races.
To bridge space's colossal abyss you must have a means of long distance
communications.  When IC the TinyMUX channel system, page, and whisper do not
work.
  
Even on a planet or star base you cannot simply holler and expect your
intended listener to hear you.  Using "links" of many types, interconnected
with relays, B5 MUX provides a means to holler and be heard over vast
distances.
%cy<Continued in +HELP CCS2>%cn
  
&ccs2
One reason we have links at all is we want communications to remain private.
The system supports secure communications through encoding with codes.  Note
that these codes can be cracked and communications intercepted.
  
Starting with the individual we have personal links, often seen as adhesive
devices on the back of the hand.  Note: some races carry their links, other
implant them, and the Vorlons: no one knows about the Vorlons.  Personal
links are low power and minimum range.  Within even a star base or on a
planet they have extremely limited range.  As with contemporary cell phones,
these personal links exchange their signal through relay points.  Modern cell
phones use encryption to transmit the messages: automatically established,
encryption uses a present code attached to the broadcast frequency to encode
the message.
%cy<Continued in +HELP CCS3>%cn
  
&ccs3
B5 also supports such encryption.  As a message reaches out for its
destination it looks for a relay that will accept the <CODE> attached to it,
the code that encrypts it.  When a relay gets a message it can accept it
tries to forward it, either to a link of some type or to another relay that
supports the <CODE>.
  
Thus, relay systems can be actually stolen and become strategic targets.  An
empire's relays are important for ship to ship and colony to home world
communications.  You can target for destruction or intercept and monitor
communications by compromising a relay!
%cy<Continued in +HELP CCS4>%cn
  
&ccs4
Messages are transmitted on different frequencies ranging from 0 to 31.99,
inclusive.  You can attach an access code to a frequency that guards the
message from easy interception.  An unencoded message is possible, this is a
broadcast signal you want anyone and everyone to access.  Larger links -
those aboard fighters, ships, bases, or on planets - allow greater distances
before requiring a relay.  These have increasingly more power and can monitor
increasing numbers of frequencies.  In order from (generally) least powerful
to most powerful are personal, fighter, ship, base, planetary.
  
Fortunately, despite its theoretical complexity, actually using the character
communications system is simple.  Before using any items, you must first tell
B5 what you want to direct the commands to by issuing the GRAB command in the
format %ch%cgGRAB%cn <ITEM> where <ITEM> is any link.

Player character combat is a real and true possibility on B5 MUX.  Yes,
player killing (often called PK) is possible and allowed; however, mindless,
senseless, pointless slaughtering often called "hack n' slash" will not be
supported.  (Note that the Babylon 5 universe shows us that, sometimes, what some
might call hack n' slash actually occurs, but the slaughter is never the end.
Individuals trying hack n' slash will likely get visited by Vorlons or
prosecuted as murders.)
  
Personal combat is based on a MUD-esque system.  The system is not turn based
and uses a very few simple commands.  Success or failure at personal combat
is primarily dictated by the skills and attributes of the combatants.  The
system also allows "ganging up."  You can die very easily from the personal
combat system (PCS), so do not take it lightly.  B5 supports some very
powerful and lethal weapons!
%cy<Continued in +HELP PCS2>%cn
  
&pcs2
    You begin an altercation using the %ch%cgATTACK%cn command in the format:
  
%ch%cgattack%cn <CHARACTER>
  
where <CHARACTER> is a player character in the same location.
  
Next, using the %ch%cgWIELD%cn command you %ch%cgWIELD%cn a <ITEM>.  WIELD is in the 
format:
  
%ch%cgwield%cn <ITEM>
  
where <ITEM> is a valid RP weapon you are carrying.  Upon wielding
<ITEM> the RP skills/combat system will use the appropriate skills to
decide hits and misses as well as damage.
%cy<Continued in +HELP PCS3>%cn
  
&pcs3
Unlike turn based system you do not need to type or indicate your
dodging, the skills system automatically computes dodge, roll, and
parries.
  
During combat you might wish to change weapons, you must first use the
%ch%cgUNWIELD%cn command which stops using <ITEM>, you are now in unarmed
combat (the system does not automatically use something else!).  You must use
the %ch%cgWIELD%cn command to use a different weapon.
  
Weapons also do not have infinite ammunition, they must be %ch%cgRELOAD%cned
at different rates.  Different weapons use different "clips," meaning there
is no universal clip.  To %ch%cgRELOAD%cn, %ch%cgWIELD%cn the weapon you want to
reload, then %ch%cgGRAB%cn the clip that weapon uses.  Type the %ch%cgRELOAD%cn command,
and the weapon you are wielding will automatically be reloaded with the
GRABbed clip.
  
Obviously, you can only fight so long.  To stop your attack, type %ch%cgCEASE%cn,
this ceases your attack (you stop shooting, knifing, or doing whatever).
This does NOT %ch%cgUNWIELD%cn your weapon.  This means, if you start %ch%cgATTACK%cning
again you will use the same weapon you were using when you %ch%cgCEASE%cned your
last attack.
%cy<Continued in +HELP PCS4>%cn
  
&pcs4
The %ch%cgREST%cn command temporarily ceases the attack, but does not break it
off.  This allows you to stay in attack mode but rejuvenate yourself.  In the
B5 Universe, attacks tend to be short and lethal.
  
The PCS supports three other commands, %ch%cgGRAB%cn, %ch%cgRELEASE%cn, and
%ch%cgAFFECT%cn.  The %ch%cgGRAB%cn command is used with ITEMS such as medical
kits and personal links.  The %ch%cgAFFECT%cn determines who receives the
effects of the item.
  
%ch%cgGRAB%cn is typed in the format:
  
%ch%cggrab%cn <ITEM>
  
Where <ITEM> is an RP item such as a medical kit or personal link.  This
command is NOT the same as %ch%cgWIELD%cn, they are not interchangeable.
Opposite the %ch%cgGRAB%cn command is the %ch%cgRELEASE%cn command.  This simply
releases the <ITEM> you are presently using.
%cy<Continued in +HELP PCS5>%cn
  
&pcs5
    %ch%cgAFFECT%cn is typed in the format:
  
%ch%cgaffect%cn <ITEM>
  
Where <ITEM> is usually a player character.  This instructs the
%ch%cgGRAB%cnbed <ITEM> who or what to apply the effects of  <ITEM> to.

Skills and attributes intertwine throughout the other subsystems.
Interactions with automated NPCs, PCS, CCS, and many other actions are
influenced by skills.  However, in all cases, role play is paramount.
  
Skills establish a system whereby the various races can affect the universe
appropriately.  For example, Minbari warriors are usually highly skilled with
the Minbari fighting staff.  While other races can certainly obtain skills
with the Minbari fighting staff, it is likely, person for person, the Minbari
would be more capable with the Minbari fighting staff.
%cy<Continued in +HELP RP SKILLS2>%cn
  
&rp skills2
Further, if you try to pick or circumvent a lock, the skills system makes a
computation to determine success or failure.  The margin of failure might
determine weather you simply fail to pick the lock or you set off an alarm.
The communications systems use skills to determine success or failure for
decoding (subverting) intercepted messages.  In that case, the level of
success or failure determines how much or how little, if any, of the message
you decode.
  
Skills automatically increase as they are used.  However, as you become more
able, you increase slower.  What player characters need to know is continual
usage will increase your skills.  Further, as you get better it becomes
harder to get better.  Pure, mindless repetition will not, however, increase
skills: this is to prevent abuse frequent on MUDs.
  
B5 MUX is designed to handle all such computations transparently.  Because
skills and attributes can be so important we stress careful player character
generation.  For more information on skills and attributes, see the player
character generation guide.

Usage: %ch%cgcpage%cn <KEYWORD|*CHARACTER>
    This command starts an IC communications by paging *<CHARACTER>.  The
command also accepts two <KEYWORD>s, "ans" which answers a page and tries to
communicate on the <FREQUENCY> set with the %ch%cgCTUNE%cn command and "off"
which turns the page ability off, giving you peace and quiet.  The "hide"
command prevents you from receiving link pages and the "unhide" command allows you to receive link pages again.

are in to go to <FLOOR> where <FLOOR> matches a floor that elevator can go
to.
  
See also: %ch%cgCALL%cn
  
&release command
Usage: %ch%cgrelease%cn
    %ch%cgRELEASE%cns a %ch%cgGRAB%cnbed item.  The release command is the exact
opposite of the %ch%cgGRAB%cn command.  It instructs the game to cease using
the currently %ch%cgGRAB%cnbed <ITEM>.  This is not the same as the
%ch%cgUNWIELD%cn command.
  
See also: %ch%cgGRAB%cn, %ch%cgPCS%cn
  
&reload command
Usage: %ch%cgreload%cn
    This command reloads the weapon you are currently %ch%cgWIELD%cning.  You
must be wielding a weapon *and* have %ch%cgGRAB%cnbed a clip that fits that
weapon, otherwise the command will return an error message.
  
See also: %ch%cgWIELD%cn, %ch%cgGRAB%cn, PCS
  
&rest command
Usage: %ch%cgrest%cn
    Causes you to stop %ch%cgATTACK%cning (if you are) and rest to regain
your health.  You will rest until you begin another activity (by issuing the
%ch%cgATTACK%cn or %ch%cgGRAB%cn commands) or until you are fully healed.  If you
are %ch%cgATTACK%cning this is effectively the same as the %ch%cgCEASE%cn command.

&unwield command
Usage: %ch%cgunwield%cn
    Causes you to stop using the weapon you %ch%cgWIELD%cned earlier.  This
command applies only to weapon class IC items.  This is not the same as the
%ch%cgRELEASE%cn command and will not cause you to stop using %ch%cgGRAB%cnbed
<ITEM>s.  This command allows you to use multiple weapons during an
%ch%cgATTACK%cn.  The %ch%cgCEASE%cn command does not automatically %ch%cgUNWIELD%cn the weapon.
  
See also: %ch%cgWIELD%cn, %ch%cgATTACK%cn, %ch%cgPCS%cn
  
&wield command
Usage: %ch%cgwield%cn <ITEM>
    Causes you to %ch%cgWIELD%cn the <ITEM>.  <ITEM> must be an IC weapon type.
This does not affect GRABable items.  Before you can use a weaponary
<ITEM> you must %ch%cgWIELD%cn it, this does not occur automatically.  Also,
%ch%cgWIELD%cns are persistent across %ch%cgATTACK%cns, which means you must
specifically issue the %ch%cgUNWIELD%cn command, otherwise you continue using
the last %ch%cgWIELD%cned <ITEM> in your next %ch%cgATTACK%cn.

The MUX banking system is rather simple, having only a few commands.  A bank
owner can use the BMAKE command, which has the form of BMAKE <ACCOUNT> <CODE>
for example BMAKE Shakiri 11042 to create an account for Shakiri with a pass
code of 11042.  You log into a bank account with the ACCESS <ACCOUNT> <CODE>
command, such as ACCESS Shakiri 11042.  After you access the account, you
can check the balance with the BALANCE command, deposit money with the
DEPOSIT <AMOUNT> <CURRENCY> command, such as DEPOSIT 3000 Credits to deposit
3000 Credits into your account, or DEPOSIT 137 Old_Bloodstones to deposit 137
Old Bloodstones into your account.  The currency list includes Credits,
Crystals, Ducats, Marks, Old_Bloodstones, Kl'amra, Dr'shok, and Vakhar.
These currencies belong to Humans, Minbari, Centauri, Narn, Narn, pak'ma'ra,
Brakiri, and Drazi, respectively.  Finally, the WITHDRAW <AMOUNT> <CURRENCY>
command allows you to withdraw money once you have accessed an account.

Babylon 5 MUX supports a rich and manifold economic system that fosters and
interacts with all other subsystems.  The economy (henceforth, "econ")
depends on space for trade and transport, depends on skills and attributes to
determine success or failure, and provides reasons for combat to exist.
    
In real life, our economy has many components that appear to be independent;
however, upon closer examination, interwine infinitely.  B5's econ is no
different.  B5 supports many currencies to facilitate trade.  Because
currencies (cash) must be converted and stored, we already support banks.
The banks allow loaning and cash storage.
%cy<Continued in +HELP ECON OVERVIEW 2>%cn
        
&econ overview 2
Obviously, products not money make an economy.  Products come from factories,
mines, or farms.  All factories require raw materials, enegery cells, and/or
parts to produce their goods.  This requires you to gather the parts, energy
cells, and/or raw materials that compose your product.  Often times, these
will not be immediately available requiring you to buy or trade to obtain
them.  In the Babylon 5 universe, trade usually means space travel.
  
You acquire raw materials from mines or farms, parts from other factories.
Babylon 5 MUX supports thousands of commodities and plans, leaving open a
wide range of opportunities.  Plans detail what you must gather and then
assemble to create a product, while a product can be a part for something
else or simply a refined commodity such as water.
  
Factories, mines, and farms cost money to acquire, so you must somehow
acquire them through purchase, trade, or other means.  This forms the circle
of the econ and connects it with space and role play.

Note that, for certain reasons, certain planets will not have every one of
these economy rooms, so this is intended as a list of maximums.  For example,
without native plant and animal life, there can be no oil or petrochemical
producs, so no oil refineries.  The same applies to all the other econ rooms.
Industrial colonies will possess fewer non-industrial econ rooms, and farming
colonies will possess fewer non-farming econ rooms.

Currencies, in and of themselves, have no relevance or value.  Their value is
not based on gold or any other precious commodity.  As in real life, the
value of the good and services of the power that issues the currency and how
much other parties are willing to pay for that currency determine its value.
Currency can only be created by the wizzes.  The base values are determined
by playtesting, after which the values may rise or fall as economic
conditions warrant.

Players can create banks, form cooperatives to become a bank, and loan each
other money, given the appropriate IC actions.  Currency conversions will be
automatically handled for more seamless trade.  Babylon 5 stores currencies
in unseen credit (chit) cards.  The cards allow you to transact business
without messy currency conversions.  When you purchase an item, you simply
electronically transfer the amount of currency from your chit to another
player's chit, the conversion occurring automatically.
  
Valid currencies are: Credits, Crystals, Ducats, Marks, Kl'amra, Dr'shok,
Vakhar, and Old Bloodstones.

The banking system has no consoles and a very few commands.  The commands
must be typed inside a bank, available on every colony planet, homeworld
planet, and often large space stations.
  
%ch%cgaccess%cn <ACCOUNT> <PIN>
    Chooses what <ACCOUNT> you want to access.   You must give <PIN>, which
is similar to a pine code.  You must set your <ACCOUNT> to %ch%cgACCESS%cn before
getting the %ch%cgBALANCE%cn, %ch%cgDEPOSIT%cning, or %ch%cg WITHDRAW%cning currency.
  
%ch%cgbalance%cn
    Gives the balance of the account you are %ch%cgACCESS%cning.
  
%ch%cgdeposit%cn <AMOUNT> <CURRENCY>
    %ch%cgDEPOSIT%cns the <AMOUNT> of <CURRENCY> into the account you are accessing.

Products and currencies might make our world go 'round, but trade makes the
Babylon 5  universe go 'round.  Any B5 universe requires trade.  To gather
the many parts which compose products you will inevitably need to trade.  No
one world will have all the required items for everything they might produce.
Efficiencies of scale will require you acquire raw materials, parts, and
finished goods from places on the same planet or another planet entirely.
      
Trade, then, requires transport.  Anything can be traded: money, technology,
raw materials, parts, or finished goods.  To trade something you must get
together with a buyer and that buyer must either barter with you or pay you
with currency.

Trade is conducted in real time with truly realistic requirements.  You will
not be able to hoist a generator and stuff it in your pocket, walk a few
rooms, drop it, get paid for it and leave.  Rather, B5 econ requires you use
a cargo lift (transport vehicle) which can carry the weight and girth of the
object(s) in question.  The lift must then be transported, either by being
driven or pushed or flown, to another location.
  
During transit you may have to pay tariffs or taxes, docking fees, and other
expenses to governments or private ventures.  This facilitates a cash economy
like real life.  At this time, tariffs and taxes are not determined, by the
wizards, as players have complete control over them for obvious IC reasons.
Because docking facilities, cargo lifts, ships, and other items will require
purchase and maintenance, those individuals and/or governments running/owning
them will require currency, thus taxes, tariffs, and fees are likely
necessities.  However, we leave this up to the players.
%cy<Continued in +HELP TRADE 3>%cn
    
&trade 3
Lifts are limited in the weights they can carry.  Different lifts can carry
different products and different weights.  For example, building a ship will
require acquiring many parts.  You will need to get a ship blueprint (plans
on B5 MUX), acquire a place to assemble it, and bring together its many
component parts.  These parts are likely to be scattered, so you will need to
trade for them, either purchasing with currency or by barter.  Then you must
transport (or someone must transport) the parts to the location of assembly.
Larger parts will require larger lifts which require larger ships to move
them across great distances.  Alternatively, you can purchase a pre-assembled
vessel and lift.
  
Obviously, creating large products will not be trivial or cheap, nor should
it be.  It will require much coordination and large sums of currency.
Players can and will be allowed to purchase ships, ships will not be
distributed by some central clearinghouse.  They will be manufactured at
factories, using raw materials from mines.

Consoles, Commands, and Components
  
As with all systems, we tried to make the trade commands as simple and as few
as possible.  The trade commands must be typed in a trade/cargo room:
  
%ch%cgebuy%cn <COMMOD #> <AMOUNT> <CURRENCY>
    Buys <AMOUNT> of <COMMOD #> as listed in the trade room's %ch%cgLCARGO%cn listing
using the <CURRENCY>.  The system automatically computes the full purchase
price based on the <AMOUNT> of the <COMMOD #> you are attempting to purchase.
This command only applies to transactions within traderooms, not between
individual characters.
%cy<Continued in +HELP TRADE 5>%cn
    
&trade 5
%ch%cgesell%cn <COMMOD #> <AMOUNT> <CURRENCY>
    Sells <AMOUNT> of <COMMOD #> to the traderoom using <CURRENCY>.  The
system automatically computes the full purchase price based on the <AMOUNT>
of the <COMMOD #> being sold.  You need to check the money supply of the
trade room using the %ch%cgSUPPLY%cn command.  This command only applies to
transactions within traderooms, not between individual characters.
    
%ch%cgsupply%cn
    Lists the money supply available in that traderoom.  If you want to
%ch%cgESELL%cn something to the traderoom, you need to check the %ch%cgSUPPLY%cn,
as the traderoom must have sufficent currency to complete any %ch%cgESELL%cn
transaction.  This command only applies to transactions within traderooms,
not between individual characters.
%cy<Continued in +HELP TRADE 6>%cn
    
&trade 6
%ch%cglcargo%cn <CURRENCY>
    List all commodities in that trade/cargo room along with their present
prices in <CURRENCY> where <CURRENCY> is a valid econ currency.  This
performs the currency conversions automatically so you do not need to.  This
command only applies to transactions within traderooms, not between
individual characters.
  
%ch%cgepay%cn <CHARACTER> <AMOUNT> <CURRENCY>
    Pays <CHARACTER> the <AMOUNT> in <CURRENCY>.  If you do not have enough
<AMOUNT> of <CURRENCY> the transaction will fail.  This command applies to
economy system transactions between characters.
%cy<Continued in +HELP TRADE 7>%cn
    
&trade 7
%ch%cgegive%cn <CHARACTER> <AMOUNT> <ITEM>
    Gives <CHARACTER> the <AMOUNT> of <ITEM> where <ITEM> is a IC economy
system item that you  have for trade.  This command does not, at all, force
the <CHARACTER> to pay for <ITEM>.  <ITEM> does not transfer an object, you
must use the normal MUX %ch%cgGIVE%cn command for trading <ITEM>s which are actual
objects (like weapons, med kits, etc.).  This command applies to economy
system transactions between characters.
  
%ch%cgcommods%cn
  Lists the commodities you are carrying.  As with the %ch%cgLCARGO%cn command
for traderooms, this lists all economy system items that are not atual
objects.  %ch%cgCOMMODS%cn provides a listing of which commodities you are carrying,
a name, amount, size, and how much of your total cargo carrying capability
you have filled.  This command applies to economy system transactions between
characters.
  
%ch%cgmoney%cn
    Lists the money you are carrying, broken down by currency.  This is
important if you try to use the %ch%cgEPAY%cn command.  This command applies
to economy system transactions between characters.

Mines and farms are where you gather raw materials.  To gather raw materials,
to work farms, to transport these items you will need to acquire equipment
either through purchase or trade.
  
Just as in real life, you must prospect for a mined item, called ores on B5
MUX.  Ores occur in limited quantities, are not equally nor equitably
distributed, and vary in degrees of purity and/or utility.  A planet might
have near inexhaustible supplies of an ore many societies value greatly but
little or nothing else of intrinsic value: that is, it could be completely
arid and uncultivable, it could have no other important ore deposits, and
might, essentially, be completely hostile to other industries.
%cy<Continued in +HELP MINES & FARMS 2>%cn
    
&mines & farms 2
Assuming that ore is valued enough, no matter the cost, anyone could mine it
if they acquire the proper equipment.  Obviously, in such situations, avenues
for conflict and profit occur.  Obviously, trade will be fostered.
      
A mine can be a surface or below surface operation and mines might extract
more than a single ore.  Mines can  be unprofitable, just as in real life.
Mines require extraction, processing, and refining equipment, just like in
real life.  Ores are considered a commodity even when refined.

Farms produce food stuffs of many varieties.  Food stuffs are required for
life as everyone must eat.  A farm requires obtaining land, the "seed" to
plant the farm, and equipment to work and harvest it.  Not all farm products
can be harvested from everywhere.  Thus, even with farm products, an unequal
and unequitable distribution will develop.  This distribution will require
trade between those who have and those who do not have some commodity.
%cy<Continued in +HELP MINES & FARMS 3>%cn
            
&mines & farms 3
As with mines, farms can be exhausted.  The products will require transport
to other location, and transport begets lifts.  Many product plans require
farm products to complete, which makes farm products important beyond being
food stuffs.
    
Commands, Components, and Consoles
    
%ch%cg+plans%cn
    Lists the commodities the mine/farm you are in can mine/farm.  This does
not mean the mine/farm can efficently or effectively obtain them, it merely
says it is possible.  Not all mines/farms can produce all commodities (also
called raw materials), if some commodity (raw material) is not listed then
that mine/farm cannot mine/farm for it.
    
%ch%cgPLAN%cn <PLAN>
    Lists the input commodities required to process or build <PLAN>.
%cy<Continued in +HELP MINES & FARMS 4>%cn
    
&mines & farms 4
%ch%cgbuild%cn <COMMODITY>
    Tells the mine or farm you are in to begin %ch%cgBUILD%cning <COMMODITY> where
<COMMODITY> is the number of an available commodity that mine or farm can
build.  Note, not all mines and farms can mine/farm all commodities.  A list
of mineable/farmable commodities can be displayed using the %ch%cg+PLANS%cn
command.
    
%ch%cgpset%cn <LEVEL>
    Allows you to set the production factor.  The production factor
essentially tells the mine how 'hard' to work the area being mined.
Production factors vary from 0 (stop) to X where X is 'full bore.'  X differs
for the commodity you are mining or farming, X being the highest possible
level.
%cy<Continued in +HELP MINES & FARMS 5>%cn
        
&mines & farms 5
%ch%cgstatus%cn
    Displays the production STATUS of the mine or farm you type it in.  The
command lists present mined/farmed commodity, rate of production, amount
mined/farmed, and more.
    
%ch%cgeload%cn
    Loads a commodity onto your person from the mine or farm.  The format of
this command is ELOAD <COMMODITY #> <AMOUNT>.
          
%ch%cgeunload%cn
    Loads a commodity from your person to the mine or farm.  The format of
this command is EUNLOAD <COMMODITY #> <AMOUNT>.

%ch%cy===========================================================================%cn
Think of factories as convergence points.  Factories create and assemble
products from raw materials (commodities, farm products cultivated on farms
and ores extracted from mines) and parts (produced at factories).  Factories
produce products based on the plans.
  
B5 MUX supports over 2000 distinct plans, each plan enumerates what
commodities and/or other parts constitute that product.  Factories can
support one or more plans; however, in all cases you must purchase the new
plan.  Every factory cannot produce any plan.
  
Technology levels figure prominently into factories.  You cannot produce a
product (ergo, purchase the plan for a product) you do not have the
technological ability to produce.  Every empire has pre-assigned "tech
levels" which they can increase by research and development or by acquiring
technology through purchase or trade.
%cy<Continued in +HELP FACTORIES 2>%cn
        
&factories 2
For example, you might wish to produce jump engines so your ships need not
use only pre-established jump gates.  This technology requires many
sub-techs, including metallurgy, electromagnetic manipulations, and other
disciplines.  To produce jump engines you must raise your tech levels for
each of the components jump engines require.  Then you can research jump
engines to produce them.
  
As with mines and farms, this creates a intrinsic inequity of technology and
products.  Not everyone can afford to produce expensive products, not
everyone will have the components to produce every product, and not everyone
will have the requisite tech levels to mine every ore, farm every farm
product, or manufacture in a factory every good.  Barter, theft, war, and
purchase are all valid methods of obtaining what you require.
%cy<Continued in +HELP FACTORIES 3>%cn
    
&factories 3
Factories, like mines and farms, have another interesting attribute:
location.  A factory can be taken over or destroyed.  Further, factories
inevitably produce products which much be transported.  In the B5 universe
that means a lift and usually ships.  Just like commodities from mines and
farms, products are unequally and unequitably distributed.  They can be
destroyed and are not inexhaustible.
  
Obviously, factories cost money to buy and  must be maintained (equipment
becomes obsolete or wears; new, more efficient equipment is developed).

Commands and Equipment 
  
Mines, factories,  and farms are treated very similarly.  A farm or mine is
essentially mother nature's factory.
  
%ch%cg+plans%cn
    Lists the products the factory you are in can produce.  This does not
mean the factory can efficently or effectively obtain them, it merely says it
is possible.  Not all factories can produce all products (also called parts
or plans), if some product (plan/part) is not listed then that factory cannot
produce it.
    
%ch%cgPLAN%cn <PLAN>
    Lists the input commodities required to process or build <PLAN>.
%cy<Continued in +HELP FACTORIES 5>%cn
        
&factories 5
%ch%cgstatus%cn
    Displays the production %ch%cgSTATUS%cn of the factory you type it in.
The command lists presently produced plan, rate of production, amount
produced, and more.
  
%ch%cgbuild%cn <PLAN>
    Instructs the factory to start producing <PLAN>.  <PLAN>s are
instructions on how to create something at a factory, it includes the items
needed to produce the item defined in <PLAN>, including the amounts of each
item required.  You can start %ch%cgBUILD%cning without all the component
parts of <PLAN>; however, nothing will be produced.
        
%ch%cgeload%cn
    Loads a commodity onto your person from the mine or farm.  The format of
this command is ELOAD <COMMODITY #> <AMOUNT>.
%cy<Continued in +HELP FACTORIES 6>%cn
    
&factories 6
%ch%cgeunload%cn
    Loads a commodity from your person to the mine or farm.  The format of
this command is EUNLOAD <COMMODITY #> <AMOUNT>.
  
As with mines and farms, a factory cannot necessarily produce every item the
economy system supports.  A list of produceable items for each factory is
listed by %ch%cg+PLANS%cn.

Which of the economic components will make me the most money?
  
There is no single right answer.  All of the components are equally important
and each has its costs and rewards.  Banks figure to award the highest
margins, as they require the smallest amount of actual capital investment,
yet, banks require considerable start up funds for loans and licenses.
  
Farms would require far less start up investment then either mines or
factories, with factories being the intrinsically most costly business
venture.  In all cases, diversity has its rewards.  Waffles, however, are the
most profitable.  Unfortunately the Vorlons have cornered the galactic waffle
market.
%cy<Continued in +HELP ECON FAQ 2>%cn
        
&econ faq 2
Do I have to transport everything to my factory or from my mine?
  
Of course not, entire businesses might be established purely to transport
items around.
    
On other games ships are not actually produced, players create them and then
you must accumulate the money to "buy" them, how does B5 MUX change it and
why?
     
First, there's no player building.  Ship construction is automated from the
factories.  You must obtain a plan for a ship, which are built in factories.
Any ship contains many parts which much come together to complete the vessel.
As in real life, it is more realistic to not be able to create a ship unless
you've all the resources to produce it.
%cy<Continued in +HELP ECON FAQ 3>%cn
        
&econ faq 3
The advantages are many.  It drives the economy to produce ships, as space
becomes a major focal point in the B5 universe.  To create a ship you must
acquire many parts which means there will be trade.  Mining of raw materials
must occur, which drives that industry.  This requires role play as trades
are made, deals are struck, and alliances to form economies of scale become
necessary.
  
Thus, building a ship is complex and draws on many items, they become more
precious and vital.  However, it also allows anyone to get a ship.  Societal
and cultural influences not withstanding, B5 allows anyone with the proper
resources (through purchase or barter) to own and run a ship.  This opens
space up much wider, encourages independent traders, and generally makes a
more inclusive game.

&intro
Newbie help is intended to be the very minimum to get your started.  The
guide covers the very beginning principles of using a MUX to interact with
each other and how to setup a character so you can role play (RP).  The
stress is placed on setting up a realistic Babylon 5 Universe character.
     
Babylon 5 MUX exists to provide role play in the Babylon 5 television series
Universe.  Babylon 5, the series, exists in a complete vacuum from "reality"
(that is, our computers, chairs, cats, dogs, etc.) and from other fictional
Universes such as Star Trek.  You will see similarities, because we are
human, but be careful about leaking non-Babylon 5 into your Babylon 5 MUX
character.
     
The guide is divided into several sections:
     
[1]  About Babylon 5 MUX - Background information about Babylon 5 MUX
        (henceforth, B5MUX).
[2]  TinyMUX Basics - The bear bone basics about TinyMUX.  Communications and
       setup only--very very basic.
[3]  Setting Up an RP character - Covers the character generation systems and
       the decisions you must make when creating your character.
[4]  Where to Go Now? - What else you need to read and review to get on your
       feet.

About Babylon 5 MUX
     
B5MUX exists to create a realistic role play environment for the Babylon 5
Universe.  B5MUX starts during seasons two (right before "Coming of the
Shadows"), with a cutoff date in real life of the MUX opening day.  Anything
introduced into the series after opening day will not be considered canon.
B5MUX will diverge from the TV series as the players and administrator (First
Ones) see fit.  We are not restricting the B5MUX experience to the TV series
events, that would be boring and pointless!
     
As such, the wizzes determine all canon.  Canon is what is acceptable inside
the games internal reality.  The wizzes retain complete discretion on B5 MUX
internal reality, including excluding or including events, people, places,
and things from any subsequent Babylon 5 TV shows or movies.  Put simply, the
wizzes will determine the universe.
       
B5 MUX is player character driven.  You become a player when you connect, and
a player character when you complete character generation (henceforth,
chargen).  Chargen creates the characteristics, which include limitations,
knowledge, race, and history.   Your character will undoubtly change as it
gains experiences, just like real life.

&rules
Babylon 5 MUX Rules
              
B5MUX has a few very basic rules every player character must follow.  Being
simple rules, the wizzes take them very seriously.
    
1.  Any player found harassing another, verbally, sexually, or otherwise shall
   be summarily @nuked and site-locked.  There is no room for this on B5MUX.
    
2.  Rude, crude, and offensive names or speech are unacceptable.  Punishment
   will be determined on a case-by-case basis.  Note that this does not
   preclude in-character (IC) bickering, postering, politicking, and
   fighting; however, you are required to keep it clean.  Failure to do so
   will result in undersirable results.
%cy<Continued in +HELP RULES 2>%cn
  
&rules 2
3.  Any adult oriented (especially sexual) activities MUST occur in private,
   as we expect a significant underage collection of players.  Failure to do
   so will result in a punishment appropriate to the violation, up to and
   including @nuking and site-locking.
     
4.  Any IC activities will have consequences, just like real life.  Like real
   life, you are the sum total of all your acts.  Legal environment not
   withstanding, you are responsible for what you do, so be careful and keep
   yourself IC.  If the universe gets excessively out of hand, non-player
   characters (NPC) will become involved, perhaps very nasty NPCs (stress on
   very nasty).  If you annoy the wrong race, character, or NPC, you could
   very easily end up dying, perhaps taking your entire empire with you.
    
If you have any questions or want clarification on the rules, please contact
a wiz: JohnD, Valdar, or Mike.
    
&Basics
TinyMUX Basics
    
TinyMUX is an evolution in a long line of server software that includes
TinyMUD, TinyMUSE, and TinyMUSH among its forebearers.  Server software is
what allows us to interact and runs on some computer somewhere (in our case,
one at Northwestern University, thanks to Valdar).
    
The server can be very complicated; however, you honestly do not need to know
much to get started.  B5MUX places the emphasis on role play, not coding and
other amusements.  To successfully role play you need to know only TWO
commands: say and pose.
    
Speaking It
         
Saying is talking - it is conversation.  The double-quote character (") is
most often used to transmit a "say."  You can also use the word "say,"
although few people want to type that.  The basic format for the command is:
    
"<message>
    
Where <message> is what you want to say (speak).  Notice, you do not include
a closing double-quote ("), the server software does that itself.  Here is an
example:
%cy<Continued in +HELP BASICS 2>%cn
  
&basics 2
"Hi JohnD.
    
To the speaker (person who typed the above line), this will appear as:
    
You say "Hi JohnD."
    
And looks like this to JohnD (or anyone else in the same location as the
speaker).
    
Airam says "Hi JohnD."
%cy<Continued in +HELP BASICS 3>%cn
  
&basics 3
A more flexible command is pose, which is used to convey actions.  The colon
character (:) is most often used to transmit a "pose."  You can also type the
word "pose," few people type that.  Think of poses as actions; however, they
do not have actual physicality.  For example, if you send a pose that you
kick someone, it does their player character no harm; however, if you
actually use the personal combat system (PCS) to kick them, then they might
be harmed).  It is unacceptable role play to "cause" an action, by this you
do something like "Airam dances with Valdar."  If Valdar did not consent to
this, that forces an action Valdar did not participate in.
    
The basic format of the pose command is:
    
:<action>
%cy<Continued in +HELP BASICS 4>%cn
    
&basics 4
Where <action> is what you want to pose (do).  The server will automatically
prepend a space before <action>.  Note that TinyMUX includes a variant which
does not prepend a space, you use the semi-colon character (;) rather than
the colon.  This is useful in doing possessive actions [see below]).  Here is
an example:
    
:plays music very loud.
    
To the poser and anyone in my location, this appears as:
    
Airam plays music very loud.
    
An useful variant, the non-spaced pose allows you to eliminate the space
between the character's name and the <action>.  The basic format is:
    
;<action>
%cy<Continued in +HELP BASICS 5>%cn
  
&basics 5
Where <action> is what you want to pose (do).  The server DOES NOT
automatically insert a space.  Here is an example:
    
;s are everywhere.
    
This appears to the poser and everyone in the poser's location as:
    
Airams are everywhere.
    
That is about all the TinyMUX you really need to know.  You also need to
understand the concept of location on TinyMUX.  Your says and poses will only
be seen (read) by those player characters in your location.  Your location is
the room you are presently in.  TinyMUX does allow some called "forwarding"
which increases the area where people are in earshoot or sight of you;
however, these are something you cannot control.  Put simply: location is
where are you are standing, surrounded by sound-proof and opaque walls.
        
&setup
Setting Up A Player Character
        
This guide dedicates extraordinary length to setting up a player character
because the process is so very important.  Setting up a character is
creating, literally, a person.  The provides an overview, deferring to the
in-depth guides for detailed explanations.  Further, Babylon 5 MUX will not
pressure you to rush into completing your player character.
    
By virtue of connecting to Babylon 5 MUX you already created a character, an
entry in the database.  However, you have not created a player character
(PC).  A player character can partitipate in role play, has skills and
characteristics, an In character (IC) history and life.  A character is
simply a database entry and cannot participate in role play nor does it
possess any skills, it is completely Out Of character (OOC).
%cy<Continued in +HELP SETUP 2>%cn
    
&setup 2
You have much to consider when designing your PC.  Note: None of these
questions are separated, they influence each other.  You need to answer some
questions (at this point, I suggest getting out paper and pen):
    
[1] What race do you want to be?  Each race on Babylon 5 has individual
    strengths and weaknesses.  Your choice, to a large degree, will determine
    what you can and cannot do, systemically, in role play.  That is to say,
    race will determine if server software allows you to even try something!
    
An example would be Minbari trying to take a Vorlon skill.  As stated in the
player character generation guide, you are not permitted to take Vorlon,
Shadow, or their allies' skills.  You will also need to justify taking skills
of other races.  For example, you need to justify a human taking Minbari
Fighter Piloting.  As a good guideline, do not take any alien skills.
%cy<Continued in +HELP SETUP 3>%cn

&setup 3
[2] What do you want to do?  What you player character goals are will go a
    long way towards dictating what skills you choose and race you become.
    By way of example, Minbari simply are not likely to become free traders.
    As a matter of fact, they are not allowed to because their society is
    structured in a fashion that does not allow it!
    
[3] What skills do you see your PC having?  Will you be nimble but dumb, or
    intelligent yet physically not adroit?  Write down the skills you would
    expect to have if you were that PC.
    
[4] Move your mind away from thinking of yourself as a typist.  Your PC is
    not your typist (the player itself is).  When you become your player
    character (said to be In character), you become your player character.
    This is acting.  Just like a good actor never lowers his gaurd, you
    cannot ever lower yours.  You are living a life as if you were that PC,
    completely and absolutely.
%cy<Continued in +HELP SETUP 4>%cn
    
&setup 4
A note on IC vs OOC is needed.  IC (In character) is that time in which you
are playing (or, if you prefer, acting out) your player character and OOC is
the rest of the time.  On Babylon 5 MUX, expect to be mostly IC.  When you
are IC you are expected to act as your character would act.
    
Taking an example from the series: Sheridan travels to Z'ha'dum, home of the
Shadows.  There Sheridan knows full well he will die, it is a one-way trip.
Now, if you are like me you prefer to life over death, unless something
overrides that most fundamental directive.  I also hate when my player
characters die, because I put so much time in them.  In this situation
however, IC actions dictate you take this risk (just as Sheridan did).  Your
PC and your character will die, gone, toast, nuked.  Note that this was just
an example, and this incident has not yet happened in our timeline.  It may
very well never happen.
    
To not act in an IC manner will result in the same result, only worse: you do
not get the glory!  Of course, if you made Sheridan's choice, the Gods have a
way of rewarding ICness.
%cy<Continued in +HELP SETUP 5>%cn
  
&setup 5
Back to making a character.  Now that you decided what you want to be, both
racially and what your PC's goals are, you can begin the process of actually
assembling the pieces.  Assembling the pieces means going through player
character generation.  Babylon 5 MUX does have a long PC generation process
because it is so important.  For details on PCG, consult the player character
generation guide in +HELP CHARGEN.  An overview is provided here:
    
[1] Create a character.
[2] Choose a race.
[3] Choose the skills and attributes you want to have using the PC generation
      guide in +HELP CHARGEN and keeping in mind your PC's goals.
[4] Decide on point totals to allocate to your attributes.  Importantly, you
      cannot LEARN (take more points in a skill) then the amount you allocate
      to your LEARN attribute!
[5] Decide on point totals to allocate to each skill.  The PC generation
      guide in +HELP CHARGEN details the tradeoffs between general and
      specific skills as well as describing complementary skills you might be
      interested in.
[6] Actually go through the online PC generation system and allocate the
      points.  The PC generation guide describes the process in detail.  This
      will only take a few minutes.
%cy<Continued in +HELP SETUP 6>%cn
    
&setup 6
Note: We expect you to spend considerable time making your player character.
We will not rush you and will provide as much assistance as possible.  You
should expect to spend most your PC generation time defining what you want
your PC to be like, what skills it has, what strengths and weaknesses, what
probably history it has, and the relative levels of your choosen skills as
well as absolute point allocations for attributes and skills.
    
&Closing
Closing
    
Babylon 5 MUX is designed, from the ground up, to be a role play game.  It is
not intended to be a hack-n-slash game and the wizzes will not allow it to
become one.  Further, B5 MUX has devoted considerable time and resources to
assuring balanced play.  If you prepare, you will have great fun.  If you do
not, you will hate B5 MUX and leave: of that I can assure you.
    
All of the wizzes have considerable gaming experience, and we placed all
those experiences (bad and great) into B5 MUX.  We are, however, always open
to comments and always want to improve.  Please contact us if you have ANY
questions: player character generation is the absolute most important single
activity you will ever engage in on B5 MUX.  We cannot stress enough how
vital it is to be patient and comprehensive in your character creation.
     
Again, ask questions if you have them.  We will explain.  In the end, "you
must understand your way."

&space coordinates

Coordinates are given in both XYZ and spherical format(bearing and 
elevation).  When you specify a heading you need to specify the bearing, 
elevation, and roll.  The bearing axes look like this:
    
                            Positive Y
                               90
                               |
                               |
                               |
           Negative X 180------+------0 Positive X
                               |
                               |
                               |
                              270
                            Negative Y
        
Elevation is the tilt of your ship, always between 0 and +360 degrees.
    
Roll is the rotation of your ship.  You could visualize a roll of 180 to be a
ship "flying on its back".
     
Two sets of coordinates define a ship.  One gives your position, and one
gives your orientation.  Positions are usually listed as XYZ.  Orientations
are usually listed as heading, elevation, and speed.
     
The difference between heading and bearing is that bearing is where the
target is, relative to you.  Heading is which way he's going.
         
&space headings

All navigation headings are handled in spherical coordinates.  The bearing of
other ships/planets are given relative to the position of your ship.  Meaning
that if you set your heading equal to the ships bearing, you will be
travelling straight towards it.
    
When you change headings, the ship will begin to turn towards the new heading
at a rate determined by both the ship size, and the maneuverability rating of
the ship.
   
&space engineering

The engineering console control the power output and allocation for the
ship's energy grid.  A ship's reactor produces a certain amount of energy
every tactical turn.  This energy is given to helm, navigation, batteries,
etc.  as dictated by the engineering allocation.  Energy allocated to
navigation is further distributed to the engines and other varioues nav
systems, and power to helm is given to weapon systems, and so on.  Energy
production happens every turn, and systems that are allocated energy will
receive that energy every turn as long as engineering can keep the supply
going.
    
&space reactors

The reactor on a ship produces a certain amount of power per tactical turn.
This is assigned to three places: helm, nav, batteries, communications, and
damage repair.  This allocation will remain constant unless there is a change
in the reactor setting.  If the setting is raised, more power will become
available and the engineer should reallocate.  If the setting drops below the
allocated energy, across-the-board cuts will be assigned to all stations by
the ship's computer.  To avoid this, reallocate for the lower setting before 
actually changing the setting, as a few points are typically lost due to the
inefficiency of the shortfall process.

console (man sci).

SCISCAN <SHIP#>		- Perform a very active scan on the specified ship.

&jump gates

To use a jump gate you must be heading drectly for it and within 5 units.
You should automatically be taken into it and either into or out of
hyperspace.  It is most likely to work if you are travelling a speed of 1
unit/tick.

&ship systems

A system is any special component aboard a ship.  Systems are broken up by
area (eng, helm, nav).  Each of these areas have their own systems.  Each
system has an ID number which is specific to the area (engineering system 4
is not the same as nav system 4).  When you type the area status command (ns,
es, hs) you will see a list of systems along with their id number.  Many
systems can take energy (weapons, sensors, engines, etc).  You allocate
energy to system through the areas allocate command (na, ha, ea).

To avoid players carrying too many weapons or items in their inventory, the
wiz staff has decided upon a temporary ruling until inventory space code is
in.  Each player is allowed to carry one armor and the following: one large
item, or one medium and one small item, or two small items.  Allowable ammo
is one clip for large weapons, two clips for medium weapons and three clips
for small weapons.  Note that this includes everything in your inventory and
everything in any containers you are carrying.  Exactly what each character
can have and is IC is up to empire heads in the hope that we won't see medics
or diplomats (or anyone else who shouldn't be carrying them) with weapons and
armor, everyone with military grade armor or royal guard armor and so on.
Note that other things that shouldn't be in your inventory are obvious, as
defined by IC and RL, such as carrying around vehicles or chest and drawer
closets.  Note that players will have until November 1, 1998 to get rid of
their excess inventory objects.  Anything found after then which violates the
ruling will be destroyed without compensation.  Which weapons are which size
is defined %ch+HELP SIZES%cn.

&fuel code
Babylon 5 MUX now has fuel code, with endurances listed in each empire's
+BBOARD group and are available from empire heads.  A number of players seem
to have used fuel code as an excuse not to send people out into space and so,
drive them away from the MUX.  This is an extremely poor and OOC solution to
an IC issue and one that the wizard staff does not want to see continuing.
As listed very clearly on the economy web pages, fuel is produced by all
empires, so all empires should be creating it and distributing fuel to its
ships and storage depots across each empire's territory.
            
Each docking bay on a ship or station is able to refuel any ships or fighters
in those docking bays, provided enough fuel is available in that ship or
station's cargo bay.  This has been true for some time, thanks to Mike and
Valdar's fuel code and JohnD calculating endurance figures for each ship
on the MUX.  All you do is dock your ship or fighter, obtain clearance for
refuelling, refuel the vessel and you're good to go.  Refusing players the
time out in space for patrols is ridiculous, as refining fuel and refueling
vessels is a rather simple process.
