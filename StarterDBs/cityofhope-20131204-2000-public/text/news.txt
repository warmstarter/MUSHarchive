[header(Theme)]
Have you ever looked for something better? Better than what you have now? Better than what's around you? Are you tired of the same old, dull and dreary, the stressful life that surrounds you? The frustrating feeling that you just simply aren't getting anywhere no matter how hard you try? Well, there is a place of Hope. A place where you can relax, take a break from everyday stressful life, and find that peace that you've been looking for... that prosperity.

City of Hope, Prospect, California welcomes all within its glamorous folds, with secrets and mysteries abounding with a rich history and a life of their own. There's plenty of room for all within this new, undiscovered territory, and everyone has the chance to take a piece of the pie, revel in the freedom that America brings to these sacred lands, and take a chance to make something of themselves, becoming the legends of the future.

Prospect is a little bit of a paradise. Half of the year is summer, the other half is Fall skipping over winter and going right into Spring. Within paradise's boundaries, even the most humble can find easy living. When things are so simple and easy, it becomes hard to care for the big things in life. Those things that truly matter in the greater scheme of things slip through our conscious mind and end up behind the solace of our more comfortable lives.

What will this paradise hold for the soul? A haven of comfort and stability? Or perhaps the encroaching darkness will sink its tendrils into your spirit and infect your humanity... slowly corrupting you in its wake. Will you strive for power, lust for wealth, and let apathy crush your cares for those that you love and cherish? This is paradise in a World of Darkness.

& open chargen
[header(Open Chargen)]
Here at City of Hope, we offer open character generation. What is open chargen? Open character generation is where any player can potentially make a character without staff intervention. Staff at City of Hope feel that the players are what makes the game, and we want to make character creation as easy and as fun as possible.

* There is no requirement to request pre-approval of your concept before filling out your character sheet.
* There is no requirement to write a background.
* There is no requirement to justify every single stat on your character sheet.

Staff does approve characters before they enter RP:
* If you spent too many points, we'll let you know what to fix. If you spent too few, we'll let you know that you can spend more if you want.
* We have some house rules, e.g. Willpower cannot start above 8.
* We require +notes for stats where the number alone is not self-explanatory, e.g. if you take Allies 2 then we need to know who those two allies are.

& backups
[header(Backups)]

  * The backups are replicated to an out of state server.
  * Backups are retained for six months.
  * Periodically, backups are retrieved, decrypted, and tested to ensure they can be used to restore the game.

& changeling theme
[header(Changeling Theme)]
The Duchy of the Setting Sun, located in the Kingdom of Pacifica, is currently in the midst of a cold war between the two opposing courts. Setting Sun is comprised of four Counties: Ember Skies, Reflective Dawn, Lion's Reach, and Emerald Dale. Within the current County of Lion's Reach is the Rhapsody freehold which has been declared a neutral zone where any Fae, seelie or unseelie, can congregate and be safe. The Freehold is guarded by County hired guards who also patrol the nearby Lost in Time Market.

All these territories follow the Escheat (see [pcol(news Escheat)]). Nobles within their private freeholds/territory may have varying rules. Currently there is a semi-truce between the courts, and the Duchy is shared in as much as no one is overtly stepping upon another's toes. However, things do happen behind the scenes for both players and NPC's. Public appearances of civility are maintained, but that doesn't mean that bad things aren't happening behind the scenes.

Duchy of the Setting Sun Main NPC's:

[pcol(Duke Simon "Back Breaker" Cartwright ap Fiona)] - Unseelie Satyr
[pcol(Duchess Dahlia Rengstorff La Fleur ni Gwydion)] - Seelie Sidhe
[pcol(Marquis Melyn Silver Tongue ap Eiluned (landless courtier))] - Seelie Sidhe Steward of Caer Buillemilis, voice of the Duke and Duchess, personal secretary of Their Graces.
[pcol(Countess Ymina Even Hands ni Gwydion (landless courtier))] - Seelie Sidhe Chancellor of Setting Sun, whose duties include sitting as judge of the lower court and acting as emissary as needed.
[pcol(Baron Igmarn ap Fiona (landless courtier))] - Seelie Troll Castellan of Setting Sun, Captain of the Castle, First General of the Duchy Armies.
[pcol(Mr. Daffyd Deanne)] - Seelie Boggan, Majordomo of Caer Buillemilis, head of household staff.

& escheat
& the escheat
[header(The Escheat)]
The Escheat and example punishments for breaking specific Rights.

[pcol(The Right of Demesne)]

%tA lord is the king of his domain. He is the judge and jury over all crimes, large and small. His word is law. A noble expects obedience from his vassals and respect from all others. In turn, a noble respects those lords superior to him.
%t[tcol(Penalties for Breaking)] - As there are many gradients in breaking this Right, there are an equal variety of punishments to be dealt out based on the severity of the breach. Gross disrespect or insults to one of higher rank might earn the violator a period of time in public stocks, ranging from an hour or more. Repeated bad behavior or countermanding direct orders that results in danger to others can earn a lashing or a brief, temporary banishment from the Barony/County/Freehold.

[pcol(The Right to Dream)]

%tMortals have the right to dream unhindered by our needs. The Dreaming will die if we steal directly from the front. No one is allowed to use Glamour to manipulate the creative process. Although you may inspire creativity in the mortal mind, it is forbidden to give direct instruction or to infuse a human with raw Glamour.
%t[tcol(Penalties for Breaking)] - Those found abusing Dreamers will be given a stern warning upon first offense, and if they are caught doing so again may be charged with undertaking a quest for redemption or be placed under a geas. Penalties will increase in severity to match the crime.

[pcol(The Right of Ignorance)]

%tDo not betray the Dreaming to Banality. Never reveal yourself to humanity. Not only will humanity hunt us down for our wisdom and our power, it will overwhelm us with Banality and destroy our places of power. The more humanity knows, the more ardently it will seek us, draining the world of Glamour and petrifying our essence with its basilisk gaze.
%t[tcol(Penalties for Breaking)] - A stern warning and order to fix the situation will be given upon first breach of this Right. 'Fixing' the situation may include the death of the mortal that has been exposed or in some permanent way ensuring that they never reveal the information they have been given. A second breech will result in the violator's tongue being removed either physically or by geas for one week. If it was done physically, they will be healed and restored to their previous state at the end of the punishment. Third violations of this Right will result in chimerical death, dealt outside of a Freehold.

[pcol(The Right of Rescue)]

%tAll Kithain have the right to expect rescue from the foul grip of Banality. We are in danger together and must strive together to survive. Never leave anyone behind. Kithain are required to rescue other faeries or any creature of the Dreaming trapped by those who serve Banality.
%t[tcol(Penalties for Breaking)] - Fae found in violation of this Right will be summarily banished from the Freehold for a specific amount of time or may be sent on a quest of redemption.

[pcol(The Right of Safe Haven)]

%tAll places of the Dreaming are sacred. Kithain cannot allow faerie places to be endangered. All those who seek refuge in such places must be admitted. Freeholds must be kept free of both Banality and worldly violence.
%t[tcol(Penalties for Breaking)] - Violators of this Right will be either shunned or banished for a specific period of time. Repeated offenses will earn longer periods of punishment.

[pcol(The Right of Life)]

%tNo Kithain shall spill the lifeblood of another Kithain. No Kithain shall bring salt tears unto the earth. No Kithain shall take from the Dreaming one of its own. Death is anathema.
%t[tcol(Penalties for Breaking)] - Fae who violate this sacred Right can face imprisonment for a specified period of time, maiming or banishment. Extremely dangerous quests might also be considered as penance in certain circumstances at the ruling of the Lord, Lady or Chancellor.

& Wraith
[header(Wraith)]
For some reason, possibly due to the enormous number of supernaturals in Prospect, the Shadowlands are weak here. Nihils open up all the time, and the tempest that rages over the oceans is always threatening to blow onto land. The hierarchy basically decided that it was only a matter of time before the whole place fell into the ocean, as it were, and cleared out, making Prospect a sort of wild west borderland.

Without the hierarchy to police the place, and with nihils much more common here than elsewhere, several groups stepped in to keep the specters under control. Some neighborhoods are ruled by gangs, literal gangs of renegades -- in many cases renegades who were part of the same gang, in the same neighborhood in life. One or two heretic priests, having fled here to escape persecution and set themselves up in whatever churches are around, have created sanctuaries. And doomslayers come looking to take on the mother lode of specters.

(Credit to Leila's player for coming up with this explanation of why there are no hierarchy patrols attacking PCs for wandering back and forth across the shroud.)
