    lpos(<string>, <character>)
  
    This function returns a list of the positions where <character> occupies
!   in <string>, with te first character of the string being 0. Note that
    this differs from the pos() function, but is consistent with other string
    functions like mid() and delete().

    This function is similar to the @search command, except it returns
    just a list of dbref numbers. It is computationally expensive, and
