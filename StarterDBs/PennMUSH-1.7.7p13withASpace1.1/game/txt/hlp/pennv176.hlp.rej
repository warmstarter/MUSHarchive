+ Version 1.7.6 patchlevel 9                      April 9, 2003
+ 
+ Fixes:
+    * index-files.pl now produces a sensible warning for duplicate
+      help topics, rather than a perl warning. Suggested by Cheetah@M*U*S*H.
+    * Spellnum cosmetic bug with 'seventeen' fixed. Report by Jules@M*U*S*H.
+    * Another wrap() buglet tracked down and fixed. Probably the one
+      reported by Nymeria@M*U*S*H.
+    * Memory leak in flip() and scramble() fixed.
+    * Configure test for /dev/urandom from 1.7.5 got left out by mistake.
+    * Critical overflow bug in command argument parsing fixed.
