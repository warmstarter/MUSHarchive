& Code
The latest version of this MUSH code is available via anonymous
FTP, at ftp.pennmush.org, directory /pub/PennMUSH/Source.  It will
be called something like pennmush-1.7.4p0.tar.Z, or similar,
depending on the version number. You will also find files
of translations of server messages into various languages in
/pub/PennMUSH/Source/translations/<version>. See help i18n for more.

Also on that site is the MUSH manual, in /pub/PennMUSH/Manuals. It
should be called mushman.2.008.tar.Z or something similar; you should
attempt to get at least version 2.007.
Also on that site is Javelin's Guide for PennMUSH Gods, in
/pub/PennMUSH/Guide. A better way to read it is on the Web at
http://www.pennmush.org/~alansz/guide.html

This code version is being maintained by Javelin, aka Alan Schwartz. 
Suggestions, comments, and bug reports are welcome; send email to
dunemush@pennmush.org.  For information about changes in versions of the 
code, see 'help changes'.

& internationalization
& locale
& translation
Internationalization support in PennMUSH includes:
* Support for (8-bit) locale-based character sets, including
  translation of iso-8859-1 accented characters to html entities for
  Pueblo, the accent() and stripaccents() functions, and the NOACCENTS
  flag.
* Support for locale-based date/time formats
* Support for locale-based message sets for translations of server
  messages. There are active translation teams (and you can join!)
  and several languages have practically complete translation files
  available from the PennMUSH ftp site.
* Some support for locale-based string collation
* The ability to alias command and function names, so you can generate
  a set of translated commands/functions.

Most of these features get enabled by setting an appropriate environment
variable in the PennMUSH restart script.
