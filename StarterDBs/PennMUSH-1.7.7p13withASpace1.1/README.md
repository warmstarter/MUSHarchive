The archive this was extracted from had errors, so parts of this might be
missing. From a quick check, it actually looks to be mostly there. The
main error detected is in the 'txt' directory which seemed to be looping
into itself. This is left as is. The md5sum of the archive is below, and
the archive is available upon request. If you have a better version please
contact me.
