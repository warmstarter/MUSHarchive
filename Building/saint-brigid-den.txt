@dig/teleport Shop Area -- Saint Brigid's Fire
@Desc here=%r[space(5)]This store is stocked almost to the point of being cluttered. Nearly ceiling high medicine drawers cover two walls, the fronts neatly labeled with the fresh or dry herbal component stored within. Each high unit is topped with pots sheltering live plants for sale. An arrangement of herbal teas, essential oils, and stick and resin incenses is displayed on a square table draped with a lace cloth with a sign that reads "Seasonal Special: [switch(u(season),SPRING,Spring is for Lovers,SUMMER,Summer is for Athletics and Weight Adjustment,AUTUMN,Fall is for Academics and Memory Retention,WINTER,Winter is for Cold and Flu Season)]".%r%r[space(5)]The entrance wall of the store is made up of bookshelves flanking two lovely pink-glassed bay windows ('+view here/books'). The L-shaped glass counter to one side contains a display of silver, brass, pewter, and cast stone Celtic ornaments ('+view here/counter'). Chairs along the counter allow customers to rest or discuss art commissions or special requests ('+view here/sign'). Behind it is a somewhat open area where the store line and special requests are concocted. [u(#2369/store-desc-[mid(vtime(),0,3)])] The counter holds a basic computer that serves as the cash register. On each side of that computer is a loosely-woven willow basket plumped full of sweetly-scented sachets and small herbal pillows.%r
&SHROUD here=7
&VIEW_CEILING here=%r[space(5)]The ceiling is papered in bright primary-colored posters. Most of them seem to have a vaguely similar sun-symbol theme. With a bit of study, you might recognize them as being Celtic triskelles alternated with Romano-Celtic Sulis (sun-symbols). The images are alternated in such a way to map out a large Celtic cross that spreads the length and width of the ceiling. The colors flow in a dominant rainbow from red to yellow to blue to violet-black, with all the corresponding shades graduating through the center.%r

Celtic designs are by far the most common; there are Celtic crosses, and Celtic knotwork is used to form several items such as pentagrams, Stars of David, ankhs, and some non-religious symbols. There are three crucifixes bearing Jesus; though the work is small his expression is clearly of peace and love. A collection of gleaming silver rings are sized to fit a range of fingers. A pair of silver candlesticks bracket this level, fluted and engraved strips of silver coming together to form solid, stable and heavy candle holders.%r%r[space(5)]The final, and smallest level is marked "Work To Order." Most of the items are marked "Awaiting collection".%r%r[space(5)]Interspersed among the jewelry are hand carved wooden figurines of animals and people ranging in price from $5 to $100, depending on the individual size and intricacy of the work. A small sign notes the name of the carver, and that commissions are taken upon request.%r

Back Yard -- Saint Brigid's Fire(#3070RJMs$)

     This yard is dominated by an overarching aluminum frame formed into a curving hexagon with a diameter of about twenty feet. During these cold months it acts as the framework for a giant hive-shaped glass-walled greenhouse. ('+view here/knot-garden'). On far the side of the lot, there's a rectangular greenhouse, the glass set in place year-round ('+view here/glasshouse').

     A climbing rose sends vines around a trellis arcing over the entrance to a tiny tool shed ('+view here/shed').  The whole property is surrounded by chain-link fencing decorated with diagonal slats of white and green. The area is twice the size of most commercial properties in the area, most likely combined into one with a neighboring plot. Heat pipes have been sunk throughout the grounds of the yard, to keep the earth from completely freezing over the winter. Windchimes by the Green Door tinkle when a breeze taps them together.

&UDESC here=%r[space(5)]You are in an outside area enclosed by an unobtrusive chain-link fence. This is a surprisingly green and glowing nook in the midst of the concrete jungle around. Four dwarf trees grow above wild patches of herbs and shrubs. Each tree is so healthy and full of life, you can almost *see* the roots drawing sustenance from the rich soil as the branches spread out under the light from the sky. Crooked bare patches in the ground cover form natural footpaths through the low plants. Bees, earthworms, butterflies, fireflies, and other bugs all make their homes here. A few exotic faerie-like characters, pixies of some sort, flutter in a solemn dance from plant to plant.%r
&WDESC here=%r[space(5)]You are in an outside area enclosed by a rusty, sagging chain-link fence. Deep furrows and random holes have been deliberately scratched into the thin, chalky soil. Some holes are half-filled with stagnant pools of water, while others nest vermin of one sort or another. A pile of boards in one corner may be a collapsed structure. The shed door resting flat on top contributes to that impression.%r

@dig/teleport Living Area -- Saint Brigid's Fire
@Desc here=%r[space(5)]The upper floor of the building has been crafted in an open-plan design that maximizes the efficiency of every inch of space. The floor is light golden oak waxed to a low shine. A window looks out upon a small backyard garden, and another over the main street out front. In the living room area, a buff leather sofa sits before a glass-topped coffee table which rests on a brightly colored and patterned rug. There is an oversized rocking chair draped with a colorful comforter, and a large circle of chairs makes a conversational cluster. A brick fireplace is built into one corner. Through an arch up one step is the galley kitchen, with a gas stove and modern appliances. Between the living area and the kitchen is a breakfast nook with a small oak table and four ladder-back chairs. A door tucked discreetly to one side of the kitchen appears to be a bathroom. Two other doors seem to lead to bedrooms.%r%r[space(5)]Pots of green growing herbs are secured on almost every horizontal surface, battling for space with an old and well-thumbed collection of hardcover books. A hint of old incense hangs in the air. A few six-packs of different flavors of generic-brand soda cans have been heaped into an uneven stack along one section of wall. Many of the red, green, and white cans are crushed or dented in places, but, they all seem to still be unopened.%r

&HERB-DESC-SPRING Text holder=[u(herb-top)] Bright yellow daffodils, fragrant hyacinth, cheerful crocuses, and some other -- less-easily identified -- bulb flowers bloom as well. Pansies, violets, and lobelia carpet their spokes. A few herbs are just beginning to bloom -- lavender, sage, chives, and rosemary. The nasturtiums around the sundial have buds in the trailing growth. The tarragon and other herbs which slept dormant over the winter are sending forth new, bright green shoots.
&HERB-DESC-SUMMER Text holder=[u(herb-top)] The open garden is a mass of colors and scents. The nasturtiums make a bright yellow and orange mound about the sundial, a few thin spots showing where the leaves and flowers have been harvested. A whole bed of plants for teas can be seen: chamomile, bee balm, catnip, and sweet woodruff among them. Some beds are simple pairs of herbs: sage and rue, coriander and dill, the various mints and parsley. The summer flowers present a riot of sensations. Lantana spreads out bright gold and magenta many-petaled flowers. Alyssum in its gradated whites, pinks, and purples, grows nearby. Poppies perfume the air and grow rich red and deep purple. Silvery white-pink apple blossom petals drift to the ground from time to time. Iris and day-lilies alternate along the rim of the aluminum frame.
&HERB-DESC-WINTER Text holder=[u(herb-top)] Even in this season when most plants are dormant, fresh herbs are available from this greenhouse garden. Deep green rosemary, the lighter green bay leaves, several varieties of thymes, lovage, and a bit of cinnamon bark can be collected. The dwarf apple and nutmeg trees have no leaves. Most of the shrub-type plants have been pruned back for the season. A heavy base of mulch helps keep the sheltered plants from freezing completely. Layered planting boxes are supported by a series of shelves along one section of the framework. These support out-of-season and exotic plants that flourish in the relative warmth of the greenhouse.
&HERB-DESC-AUTUMN Text holder=[u(herb-top)] The fertile days of summer have ripened this open garden to full autumnal splendor. Apple tree boughs bend under the weight of full-sized fruit. The dwarf nutmeg carries a heavy load of wrinkled, solid seeds. One bed is filled with all varieties of alliums: garlic, both sweet and hot onions, and the blooming varieties of every color. This is the season to harvest and dry herbs for the winter -- dill, sage, savory, marjoram and more. The seed pods of the nasturtiums around the sundial can still be collected. On dry days, golden pollen sifts along the gravel paths like fairy dust when the air moves.
&HERB-DESC-TRAN-SPRING Text holder=[u(herb-top)] Even in the pre-spring season when most plants are dormant, fresh herbs are available from this greenhouse garden. Deep green rosemary, the lighter green bay leaves, several varieties of thymes, lovage, and a bit of cinnamon bark can be collected. The first bulbs of the season poke up spear-shaped leaves. Delicate snowdrops and crocus bloom amidst mauve and lilac hesias. The dwarf apple and nutmeg trees have no leaves. Some plants have been pruned back to prepare for spring growth. A heavy base of mulch helps keep the sheltered plants from freezing completely. Layered planting boxes are supported by a series of shelves along one section of the framework. These support out-of-season and exotic plants that are blooming in the relative warmth of the greenhouse.
&HERB-DESC-TRAN-AUTUMN Text holder=[u(herb-top)] The glass of the greenhouse moderates the temperature of this area, sheltering the growing plants from the changable seasonal weather. Apple tree boughs bend under the weight of full-sized fruit. The dwarf nutmeg carries a heavy load of wrinkled, solid seeds. One bed is filled with all varieties of alliums: garlic, both sweet and hot onions, and the blooming varieties of every color. This is the season to harvest and dry herbs for the winter -- dill, sage, savory, marjoram and more. Layered planting boxes are supported by a series of shelves along one section of the framework. These support out-of-season and exotic plants that are sprouting in the moist warmth of the greenhouse.
&HERB-TOP Text holder=This is a knot garden with symmetrical planting beds and narrow graveled paths for navigation. It's shaped like a wagon-wheel with a sundial at the center, low growing herbs as the spokes, and four beds on the rim which have a small tree centered in each -- a bay tree, a dwarf cinnamon, a dwarf nutmeg, and a dwarf apple. Shrub and hedge-like herbs surround the trees. Outlining the wheel is a ring of bulbs.%r%r[space(5)]

&KENDRA Text holder=Kendra is a short, curvily-built African-American woman in her early twenties. She has relatively pale skin, like cream with coffee added for color. Her pale golden eyes give her expression a cat-like intensity. Her nose is short and rather flat, sprinkled with dark brown freckles. Long, high cheekbones and naturally pink lips balance a strong chin. She has tightly-curled black hair that's been trimmed close to her scalp, framing the purity of her features. Her full-bosomed figure is shown to advantage in a snug sleeveless linen top and matching pants. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words "Saint Brigid's Fire". A bold black tribal-band tattoo encircles each of her forearms.
&KENNETH Text holder=Kenneth is a slim multi-racial man in his late forties or possibly early fifties. Deep golden skin and exotic features emphasize his blended ethnicity, as does his shoulder-length cloak of silky black hair. His nose is long and blade-sharp. High cheekbones and full lips balance a square chin. Cool, almost serpentine, light brown eyes regard the world with calm detachment. He wears a pair of twill pants and a short-sleeved knit top. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words "Saint Brigid's Fire".
&KENDIS Text holder=Kendis is a waifishly-thin, short girl in her late teens or early twenties, who speaks with more than a hint of an Irish brogue. A curly mop of golden-blond hair frames large cornflower-blue eyes. Softly rounded cheeks and curved lips balance a pointed chin. She's gangling enough to appear to still have a few inches of growth to add to her height, before she'll start to fill out in other directions. Her petite figure is shown to advantage in an unstructured sleeveless linen top and matching pants. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words "Saint Brigid's Fire". A series of Celtic knotwork bands stained in blue woad dye spiral up each of her arms.
&KENNA Text holder=Kenna is a gracefully-ageless pale woman of average height. Her greying light brown hair is drawn into a bun, away from her cool, serene features. Manicured eyebrows arch over large oval eyes the color of fine carnelians. She has an aquiline nose, sharp cheekbones, and a bud-like mouth. Each of her features is delicate, but, in sharp relief. Ornamental braids twisted with green and gold beads provide a decorative touch to her hairstyle. Her slim figure is shown to advantage in an flattering sanded silk top and matching skirt. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words "Saint Brigid's Fire". She is marked in blue woad pigment with flowing frond designs on the backs of her hands, and in a collar-design around her neck.
&KENDALL Text holder=Kendall is a short, plump, copper-haired young woman in her twenties. She has slightly darker skin than most redheads, tanned to a light golden brown. Her eyes are very blue, and very round. Rounded cheeks, an upturned nose, and a full mouth complete her squirrelishly-cheerful features. Two ponytails of very curly hair froth down to her waist, with a fringe of bangs across her forehead. She's very short, not anywhere near five feet tall even with shoes on, and her perfect posture only seems to emphasize her small stature. She weighs more than the fashionable ideal, as lush and ripe as a summer peach. Her softly-fleshed figure is shown to advantage in a fitted short-sleeved linen top and matching loose pants. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words "Saint Brigid's Fire".
&KENNSINGTON Text holder=Kennsington is a tall, rangy young man with the lean, hungry-eyed look of someone still growing. He has short wavy brown hair, as full and fluffy as thistledown. Slightly-tilted brown eyes topped with nearly black eyebrows are girlishly oversized in his face. His nose and mouth seem sketched into place, almost incomplete when contrasted with those large eyes. His flat young muscles ripple with potential under gypsy-brown skin. Large hands and feet are another indication that he's still growing. He wears a pair of twill pants and a short-sleeved knit top. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words "Saint Brigid's Fire". The back of each of his hands is tattooed with a rather crude design of a stylized eye circled by pointed stars.
