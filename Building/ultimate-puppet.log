@Desc Allegra the Clerk=[u(#291/[v(worker)])]
&CREDITS Allegra the Clerk=My multiworker puppet was coded completely by yours truly, Gwen Morse (http://www.gwen-morse.com/wiki/index.php/MUSHcode). The germ of the idea came from Kendall's Hellwaiter 2.0, many moons ago, but, all the code is my own. By fiddling with the "shiftchange" and "day/night/graveyard" settings, you can rotate through multiple puppet 'staff' based on the time of day and work crew. This is much more realistic than having one poor puppet bartender work 24/7.

&ANTONIO Temp Business=%r[space(5)]'He's Don Juan DeMarco - the World's Greatest Lover'...Oops. Sorry. Wrong movie. But, still, Antonio's arrogant attitude projects just how much he thinks of himself. He resembles Valentino, or perhaps a masculine Sophia Loren, tall and muscular - almost beautiful. His face is sculpted, with dark and appraising eyes, and a sensual cast to his mouth. Curly mahogany hair just brushes the collar of his blue shirt. Soft jeans follow the curves of his muscular legs, outlining the massive bulge between his thighs. He occasionally moves one hand down to shift said bulge into a more comfortable position. %r[space(5)]Sometimes it's just so...exhausting being this sexy.%r
&ALLEGRA Temp Business=%r[space(5)]Allegra is beautiful and vibrant looking, with the warm coloring and blended features of a Mayan goddess. She's in her early twenties and exudes a passionate confidence that draws male and female attention towards her. Her eyes are the deep brown-black that can only come from generations of mixed Spanish and Indian blood. Her body is short and sexily-rounded. Long black hair waves over her full breasts then flirts with her rounded hips. Her mouth is the most sensual part of her, as red and luscious as a ripened strawberry. %r[space(5)]Her clothing is snugly fitted, leaving few of her generous curves to the imagination.%r
&ALICIA Temp Business=%r[space(5)]A tight bob of black hair frames the head of this southern beauty. She has soft, pouting lips that look like they could suck the chrome off a trailer hitch, and a figure that could stop God. She is wearing a snug, wine-red velvet body suit with lacing up the front to support her full breasts. And, Lordy, how full they are! She appears to be packing quite a pair of cantaloupes in that top. A black muslin skirt swirls to her ankles to almost cover a pair of crimson leather cowboy boots.%r[space(5)]Dark red lipstick and pearl white teeth strike quite a contrast to one another as she smiles.%r
&ALEJANDRO Temp Business=%r[space(5)]Alejandro is a young man of few words, possibly because his speech is broken by a thick Mexican accent. He seems to be a bit on the short side, no more than five and a half feet tall, but with the over-sized hands and feet of a teenager not into his full growth. A halo of raven-black curls frame his attractive, Hispanic-featured face. Muscles ripple under his snugly-fit clothing, another indication that in his adulthood he will be a larger man.%r[space(5)]He seems to be trying to cultivate a mustache...only time will tell if it will ever be more than a scraggly collection of hairs over his upper lip.%r
&ALISON Temp Business=%r[space(5)]Alison is a cool-tempered young ice-princess who completes her work with quiet efficiency. No one is rude, indecisive, annoying, or even violent enough to shatter her calm control. Her pretty features are more unusual than classically beautiful, featuring tanned golden skin, wavy brown hair flashed with golden streaks, and whiskey-colored eyes that slant upwards at the corners. The details of her slim figure are concealed under loose casual clothing.%r[space(5)]She's cool but tawny-gold all over, a butterfly protected rather than trapped by amber.%r
&ALIMA Temp Business=%r[space(5)]Alima is a tall, statuesque woman in her late thirties or early forties. She has thick black hair and black eyebrows, and a Middle-Eastern face with high cheekbones, a long, straight nose, and a strong chin. She's certainly not conventionally pretty, but, her proud features have their own fascination. Her fleshy figure is mostly concealed by a voluminous caftan. Her hair is twisted into a bun held by a pair of lovely wolf-headed hairsticks.%r[space(5)]She is a woman of few smiles and fewer words.%r
