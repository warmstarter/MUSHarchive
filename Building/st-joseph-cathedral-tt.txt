@dig/teleport Triforium - St. Joseph's Cathedral
&MODE_LOOK_2 here=[space(5)]This is the main part of the Triforium level, a continuous stone balcony which runs along the three sides of the Nave and into the Transepts, before edging into the Chancel's Choir. A row of stained-glass windows, each about twenty feet tall, nestles between the tall marble buttresses and support piers. Glancing down over the four-foot raining, you see the rows of pews fanning out below you. You suddenly realize just how far down eighty feet is.
&MODE_LOOK_1 here=[space(5)]This walkway is the junction between the Triforium balcony and the entrance to the staircase leading down to the main level. Beautiful carved wooden quire stalls line the stone wall extending up about twenty feet - they replace a stained-glass window. The wood is carved into fanciful shapes of suffering figures, saints being martyred in a multitude of ways. These contrast grimly with the overall cheerful ornamentation found in the rest of the building.

&VIEW_SPANISH-CROSS here=%rA heavy Renaissance cross made of stolen Incan gold sits in a red velvet lined Lexan display case. Almost a pound in weight, the fabulous cross draws the eyes with its heavily carved surface that is only slightly worn away with time and many caressing hands. The very nature of the casting is reminiscent of Old World style. Its glittering surface is augmented by 11 square cut one-quarter carat emeralds that burn blue in their depths. A single square cut one-carat emerald sits at the center of the cross. A tiny card is set alongside the splendid cross in its case, announcing 'Restoration performed by Tawny Alexander'.%r%rOOC note: 'ex here/judgenote_cross-security' for security notes.%r

The floor of the balcony is level with the base of twenty-foot tall windows also named the Triforium windows. Reaching sixty feet up from the crown of those are the Clerestory windows, which end at the vault. (In other words: the walls extend up another eighty feet above the floor of the Triforium, with two levels of windows). Several people move along the walkway. Some are craning their heads up to stare at the windows, while others curiously glance around at each other and you. Looking over the four-foot tall stone balustrade railing guarding the edge of the walkway, you can make out the main cathedral floor down about eighty feet below.

@dig/teleport St. Joseph's Cathedral
@desc here=%r[space(5)]This is St. Joseph's cathedral, dedicated to Saint Joseph, foster father of Jesus and husband of Mary. Huge wooden doors lead out to the street, flanked by quality reproductions of classical DaVinci angels clasping golden bowls of holy water. A red carpet is rolled out starting at the entrance doorway and leading straight down the main aisleway of the cathedral to the base of the elevated altar. The cathedral is a gothic roman cross shape, with a point-arched vault ceiling over bay walls. Tall and impossibly-slender column piers provide support for the ceiling and a balcony running along the second level as well as outline the magnificent stained glass windows that form the walls. The bottom level of windows is eighty feet tall, and called the Arcade. The middle level of windows is twenty feet tall and is called the Triforium, as is the balcony that runs along it around the whole interior of the building. The upper level of windows is called the Clerestory, and at sixty feet tall, they just meet the lower edge of the vault above.%r[space(5)]Pews fan out the length and breadth of the area, dotted with parishoners praying intently. People trickle in and out of side chapels along the Arcade, and occasionally you hear footsteps echo from above. There seems to be a good amount of visitors here, no matter what the time of day.

&MODE_LOOK_1 here=[space(5)]This is the Nave. Seemingly endless rows of pews take up most of the space. Looking up, you see the overwhelming splendor of the vault. Trim, white stone arches called "ribs" criss-cross each bay, and the wide triangular spaces between are filled with smooth grey concrete. The connection of the piers, buttresses, and ribs gives the illusory appearance of downward-curving birds wings along the length of the vault. You might want to check out the stained glass 'windows' visible in the Nave.
&MODE_LOOK_2 here=[space(5)]This is the Crossing, so named because you must walk through here to cross to any other part of the Cathedral, and it forms the center of the Roman Cross shape of the building. There are no windows or walls in the Crossing (it represents the 'air' space in the center of the two tower Transepts and the Chancel and Nave), only the vault high above. This is the most intricate area of the vault in the whole cathedral, both because the pattern of the ribbing changes from a simple criss-cross to the cross being surrounded by extra arches turning it into a four-pointed star, and because the concrete has been carved with eye-pleasing triangular maze patterns. Straight above you on the exterior of the vault is the cathedral spire, which houses the auto-chimes.
&MODE_LOOK_3 here=[space(5)]Here in the Chancel, you can look at the altar platform or turn back and look down length of the cathedral towards the main entrance. Looking down the sweeping length of the building, it looks unreal: it is too tall, too slender, too graceful and fragile to stand up. It seems to have no walls, nothing to hold up the stone vault but a row of willowy piers reaching eloquently upward as they outline tremendous glass windows. The piers continue to form the ribs meeting at the crown of the vault, curving and supporting like the overarching branches of a stand of hardwood trees. Light from outside shines through the colored glass in the windows, making it glow, the effect almost magical. The Chancel is divided into two parts. Near the Crossing is the quire, with carved hardwood stalls for the Benedictine sisters of the abbey to rest during services. Beyond the quire is the high Altar area.
&MODE_LOOK_4 here=[space(5)]You are in the North Transept tower. About thirty square feet in size, it extends up the full height of the rest of the Cathedral. There is a side altar dedicated to Mary, the Holy Mother. A collection of icon statuettes depict Mary in her traditional blue and white robes, a smiling woman surrounded by a heavenly host of winged angels. A fan-shaped shelf with votive candles spreads out at her feet. Several candles are lit, their flames flickering slightly as if defying some ill wind.
&MODE_LOOK_5 here=[space(5)]You are in the South Transept tower. About thirty square feet in size, it extends up the full height of the rest of the Cathedral. There is a side altar dedicated to Saint Joseph, the foster father of Jesus and the husband of Mary. An icon statuette of Saint Joseph depicts him in his traditional brown robes, holding a plank of wood and an axe. The peacefully sublime expression on his face is often particularly relaxing to people who notice it. A fan-shaped shelf with votive candles spreads out at his feet. Several candles are lit, their flames flickering defiantly in a slight breeze.
&MODE_LOOK_6 here=[space(5)]You are seated in Pew 1. The solid wooden length of the pew extends past where you're sitting, polished smooth by both the original builder and countless faithful who have rested here before you. The back of the pew in front of yours has missals and songbooks arranged neatly in a latticed rack. A padded kneeler can be lowered to provide minimal relief from the cold marble floors.
&MODE_LOOK_7 here=[space(5)]You are seated in Pew 2. The solid wooden length of the pew extends past where you're sitting, polished smooth by both the original builder and countless faithful who have rested here before you. The back of the pew in front of yours has missals and songbooks arranged neatly in a latticed rack. A padded kneeler can be lowered to provide minimal relief from the cold marble floors.
&MODE_LOOK_8 here=[space(5)]The elevated Altar area is dominated by the altar itself, a large slab apparently solid stone covered with a white linen cloth embroidered with gold and silver cross images. Behind the altar is the highly ornamented tabernacle, curtained with more decorated fabric. There are lit candles in heavy polished candlesticks on either side of the tabernacle enclosure. Eighty feet above curves a pointed arch, the point of which supports the base of the tall hardwood cross, with a carved-ivory corpus in larger-than-life detail. The crucifix arch arcs OVER the altar area, so that it rests seemingly in midair, rather than on the wall. Seasonal colored cloth hangings with simple pictoral images and text messages flutter below either side of the base of the cross. To each side of the altar is a wooden pulpit with a microphone neatly wired in place. Each one supports a different closed book.

The great round Rose window, seated over the western entry door, is a breathtaking accomplishment. A reconstruction of the famous 'Tapestry of Creation', each 'petal' in the rose shape was based on a separate panel from the tapestry. In the roundel center, God the Creator - depicted as a solemn young man with a wise expression - raises His hand to bless the beginning of Creation. Radiating from Him are the six days of creation, long slivers of brilliant color depicting the stages from the separation of the firmament, to the making of Eve.

&VIEW_CRUCIFIX here=%rEighty feet above the floor of the Chancel spans a wide arch, the point of which supports the base of the tall hardwood cross with a carved-ivory corpus in larger-than-life detail. The arch arcs OVER the altar area, so that the crucifix floats seemingly in midair, rather than on the wall. Christ rests wearily against the heavy wooden cross, His pale limbs barely draped with a bit of rag carved into soft folds. His palms and overlapped feet are pierced with dark nails (which appear to be faintly stained red, but that could be a trick of the light). Scrolled above His thorn-crowned head are the letters "INRI". His face has a decidedly Semetic cast to it, and the ivory has yellowed with age, a fair indication that the corpus was carved many centuries ago. Seasonal colored cloth hangings with simple pictoral images and text messages flutter below either side of the base of the cross.%r
&VIEW_CANDELABRAS here=%rTwelve standing candelabras made of bronze and tipped with silver are set into specially designed niches along the length of the building. All these 8 foot candelabra were obviously gifts to the Church from a noble in the distant past, and preserved till they were placed in this cathedral. Each bears a distinctive coat of arms that is worked several times into the base plates. Ten of these massive pieces can hold up to 12 candles each on their tiered outspread arms. Two larger than the rest can hold up to 18 candles in such a way to maximize the spread of their light to the surrounding altar area where they have been placed. Each has a fine etching of fleur-de-lis into the silver that surrounds the base cuff and the arms of the candle-holders. A slight crimping in a few portions of the fleur-de-lis patterns and coats-of-arms are the only indication that these have been restored from some previously unseemly state.%rRestoration, courtesy Tawny Alexander%r
&VIEW_BAPTISMAL-FONT here=%rLooking through the grilled gate locking the baptismal chapel you see a large copper bowl resting comfortably on its base of clawed feet. This was used by priests to baptize people on the battlefield before combat during the Dark Ages. A man could immerse himself to the waist when standing in it while it was filled. Now it has the more peaceful obligation of being used in modern infant and adult baptisms. Almost worn away is a faint, half-discernible pattern of diamonds that are etched into its outer surface. One foot has been replaced with a newer and harder copper that practically matches the color of the older copper. Portions of its curving lip are penny bright with replacement material while other portions are darker but still brightly-polished copper from many centuries ago.%rRestoration, courtesy Tawny Alexander%r

Hallways lead off to the various offices, dormitories, work areas, and the Chapter Hall. There is a fine mosaic floor you can appreciate more fully with +view. A thick wooden door with a heavy lock leads further into the complex. This building houses a completely self-contained community of religious.

&VIEW_EXTRA-ROOMS here=%rHallways lead off to the many rooms in this abbey complex. A 'wooden door' near the entryway catches your attention, as well as the Sisters sitting watching the entrance with alert patience. Several rooms can be accessed as necessary by RP in the main Cloisters area: the common Dormitory, the abbey chapel, the refrectory, the chapter hall, the work area, the scriptorium and library, the guest rooms (female only), storage and security rooms, etc.
&VIEW_RANKS here=%rPostulancy: the lowest rank. A postulant joins the religious 'community', and has a small ceremony where they ask to be taught the rule of the convent and be shown the religious way of life. They are required to wear a specific 'uniform', are bound by simple vows, and must meet all the entry requirements. IC postulancy is one IC year (minimum). A postulant has no change to her name. All PC's who retroactively join must go through the postulancy, new characters may start as novices or professed sisters. She may ask to be released at any time, though, returning will of course be difficult.%r%rNovitiate: the middle rank. A postulant may present herself to the community after one year, and ask to start her novitiate. The community will vote, and if she's found acceptable, she will be allowed to join as a Novice. At this point, she has a more elaborate ceremony, changes her 'uniform' slightly, is allowed to wear the Benedictine crest, and is bound by more specific vows. The vows are traditionally taken for one or three years at a time. A novice may not progress to professed sister until she is at least 25 years old. She may ask to be released at any time - special dispensation is required unless is it occurs at the time she would normally renew her vows.%r%rProfessed Sisters: a traditional 'nun'. She is bound by solemn, perpetual (lifetime) vows, and may only be released with special dispensation. She may either dress in a full habit, or a modified version of the novice and postulants uniforms. Professed Sisters may perform certain ceremonies excluded from the other two groups (Liturgy of the Hours, etc), may offer the sacrament of Baptism, and may perform some parts of the mass (excluding blessing the Eucharist).%r%rThere are two levels of professed sisters: Choir nuns are an 'elevated' form of religious (above standard Professed Sister). There is no real IC difference in 'rank' between the two groups, choir nuns are simply better educated, and are the group the abbess and other teachers or leaders are chosen from. A choir nun is expected to start with (or buy during training) the following stats: Lingustics: Latin, Leadership or Etiquette 1, Expression or Public-speaking 1, Music 2, Singing 2, Theology 3 OR Theology 2 + a 3 in one of the following groups: Medicine, Instruction, Psychology, Diplomacy, Law, Artistry, Crafts.
&VIEW_DRESS-CODE here=%rThe dress code for postulants is: calf-length grey skirt, any solid color blouse or shirt with a loose grey vest. The shoes must be black, polished, and 'sensible' or 'comfortable' looking.

Kneeling at the feet of the rather weary-looking Christ is a young woman, her long hair uncovered, with a pitcher that endlessly pours water just past Christ's feet. You could probably 'drink' some water if you wanted to. Smoothed granite chunks have been have been stacked and cemented together to represent rocky shores around the fountain pool. The water looks cool and very clear. The scene acts as a daily reminder that it is not always the most socially acceptable people who have the strongest and deepest faith.
&MODE_LOOK_2 here=%tThis garden is a traditional English knot garden with symmetrical planting beds and graveled paths. It is shaped like a wagon wheel with a sundial at the center, low growing herbs as the spokes, and four beds between the spokes which have a small tree centered in each; a bay tree, a dwarf cinnamon, a dwarf nutmeg, and a tree rose. Shrub and hedge-like herbs surround the trees. The seasonal herbs are used to help flavor the foods served in the shelter and orphanage.
&MODE_LOOK_3 here=%tThe "forest" (if you can really call it that) is a small selection of varieties of birch trees, from Silver to Paper-Bark, that were lovingly protected during the initial construction of the Cathedral. Paths wander amidst the trees, covered with old fallen leaves that soften the ground. Large green leaves deck the birch trees, shivering with every movement of the air. A few bright flowers--wood violets and foxglove--peek out from behind greenery. Star jasmine climbs the trunks of a few trees sending out a rich fragrance. The daytime sun shines through moving leaves, casting dappled shade; at night the moon and stars silver the trees-tops with bright light, while the bases remain dark pools of shadow. Sword ferns spread between the trunks of the trees. Pendulous blossoms of purple, magenta, and white dangle from the fuchsias nestled in the ferny undergrowth. Scattered throughout the forest are a few benches of chalky-looking grey granite.

&JUDGENOTE-SANCTUARY here=People who have been offered sanctuary by a PC religious will not be removed from the grounds unless the commit an act of such heinous sacrilege that risking their life is worth removing them from the grounds. Note: 'acting up' is not heinious. Two examples of extreme behavior would be: urinating on a sacred/revered item or spray-painting profanities within the cathedral complex. In NO CASE will they be removed from the grounds without getting in IC contact with the religious who invited them here in the first place. If the behavior is extreme enough, an offending character can be 'paused' until all parties involved are online to deal with it. While on the grounds, they will be 'protected' by a small group (2-4) of religious at all times. These watchers will NOT interfere with their privacy, simply be there to make sure no one gets in to attack them. Treat as normal mortal bystanders as far as stats, with a high Mental grouping. (High Per/Wits). Sanctuary recipients leave the grounds at their own risk.

The West Facade entrance is dominated by a twenty-five foot-tall oak door with giant blackened iron hinges. Subsidiary doors about half the size of the central one (but still imposing looking) arch on either side of the main. The great Rose window crowns the main door, but the interior lighting of the building is not bright enough to let you make out any details. Flanking the doors are stained-glass windows and stone piers. More piers form the sides of the cathedral, and possibly the back as well. %r%rTall, column-like piers and arched buttresses support the weight of the stone walls and roof, allowing high, broad spaces for the giant tiers of windows. It is basically cross-shaped, with the length of the building running east-west (west is the longest section), and tall, narrow towers to the north and south. You can make out at least three seperate stories, plus a graceful point-arch vaulted roof. The building appears to be almost two hundred feet tall, and the complex takes up most of the block. A smooth twenty-feet tall cement wall surrounds the grounds of Saint Joseph's Cathedral. The wall itself surrounds the entire cathedral complex excepting the West Facade entrance (the exit marked 'Saint Josephs Cathedral').%r%rCapping the roof is the spire, which shelters the auto-chimes that toll on the hour. Stone gargoyles leer at you from shadowy niches along the west front. The entrance looks like the gateway to Heaven, which, in a way, it is.

@dig/teleport St. Joseph's Cathedral
@desc here=%r[space(5)]This is St. Joseph's cathedral, dedicated to Saint Joseph, foster father of Jesus and husband of Mary. Huge wooden doors lead out to the street, flanked by quality reproductions of classical DaVinci angels clasping golden bowls of holy water. A red carpet is rolled out starting at the entrance doorway and leading straight down the main aisleway of the cathedral to the base of the elevated altar. The cathedral is a gothic roman cross shape, with a point-arched vault ceiling over bay walls. Tall and impossibly-slender column piers provide support for the ceiling and a balcony running along the second level as well as outline the magnificent stained glass windows that form the walls. The bottom level of windows is eighty feet tall, and called the Arcade. The middle level of windows is twenty feet tall and is called the Triforium, as is the balcony that runs along it around the whole interior of the building. The upper level of windows is called the Clerestory, and at sixty feet tall, they just meet the lower edge of the vault above.%r[space(5)]Pews fan out the length and breadth of the area, dotted with parishoners praying intently. People trickle in and out of side chapels along the Arcade, and occasionally you hear foosteps echo from above. There seems to be a good amount of visitors here, no matter what the time of day.

&MODE_LOOK_1 here=[space(5)]This is the Nave. Seemingly endless rows of pews take up most of the space. Looking up, you see the overwhelming splendour of the vault. Trim, white stone arches called "ribs" criss-cross each bay, and the wide triangular spaces between are filled with smooth grey concrete. The connection of the piers, buttresses, and ribs gives the illusory appearance of downward-curving birds wings along the length of the vault. You might want to check out the stained glass 'windows' visible in the Nave.
&MODE_LOOK_2 here=[space(5)]This is the Crossing, so named because you must walk through here to cross to any other part of the Cathedral, and it forms the center of the Roman Cross shape of the building. There are no windows or walls in the Crossing (it represents the 'air' space in the center of the two tower Transepts and the Chancel and Nave), only the vault high above. This is the most intricate area of the vault in the whole cathedral, both because the pattern of the ribbing changes from a simple criss-cross to the cross being surounded by extra arches turning it into a four-pointed star, and because the concrete has been carved with eye-pleasing triangular maze patterns. Straight above you on the exterior of the vault is the cathedral spire, which houses the auto-chimes.
&MODE_LOOK_3 here=[space(5)]Here in the Chancel, you can look at the altar platform or turn back and look down length of the cathedral towards the main entrance. Looking down the sweeping length of the building, it looks unreal: it is too tall, too slender, too graceful and fragile to stand up. It seems to have no walls, nothing to hold up the stone vault but a row of willowy piers reaching eloquently upward as they outline tremendous glass windows. The piers continue to form the ribs meeting at the crown of the vault, curving and supporting like the overarching branches of a stand of hardwood trees. Light from outside shines through the colored glass in the windows, making it glow, the effect almost magical. The Chancel is divided into two parts. Near the Crossing is the quire, with carved hardwood stalls for the Benedictine sisters of the abbey to rest during services. Beyond the quire is the high Altar area.
&MODE_LOOK_4 here=[space(5)]You are in the North Transept tower. About thirty square feet in size, it extends up the full height of the rest of the Cathedral. There is a side altar dedicated to Mary, the Holy Mother. A collection of icon statuettes depict Mary in her traditional blue and white robes, a smiling woman surrounded by a heavenly host of winged angels. A fan-shaped shelf with votive candles spreads out at her feet. Several candles are lit, their flames flickering slightly as if defying some ill wind.
&MODE_LOOK_5 here=[space(5)]You are in the South Transept tower. About thirty square feet in size, it extends up the full height of the rest of the Cathedral. There is a side altar dedicated to Saint Joseph, the foster father of Jesus and the husband of Mary. An icon statuette of Saint Joseph depicts him in his traditional brown robes, holding a plank of wood and an axe. The peacefully sublime expression on his face is often particularly relaxing to people who notice it. A fan-shaped shelf with votive candles spreads out at his feet. Several candles are lit, their flames flickering defiantly in a slight breeze.
&MODE_LOOK_6 here=[space(5)]You are seated in Pew 1. The solid wooden length of the pew extends past where you're sitting, polished smooth by both the original builder and countless faithful who have rested here before you. The back of the pew in front of yours has missals and songbooks arranged neatly in a latticed rack. A padded kneeler can be lowered to provide minimal relief from the cold marble floors.
&MODE_LOOK_7 here=[space(5)]You are seated in Pew 2.

The back of the pew in front of yours has missals and songbooks arranged neatly in a latticed rack. A padded kneeler can be lowered to provide minimal relief from the cold marble floors.
&MODE_LOOK_8 here=[space(5)]The elevated Altar area is dominated by the altar itself, a large slab apparently solid stone covered with a white linen cloth embroidered with gold and silver cross images. Behind the altar is the highly ornamented tabernacle, curtained with more decorated fabric. There are lit candles in heavy polished candlesticks on either side of the tabernacle enclosure. Eighty feet above curves a pointed arch, the point of which supports the base of the tall hardwood cross, with a carved-ivory corpus in larger-than-life detail. The crucifix arch arcs OVER the altar area, so that it rests seemingly in midair, rather than on the wall. Seasonal colored cloth hangings with simple pictoral images and text messages flutter below either side of the base of the cross. To each side of the altar is a wooden pulpit with a microphone neatly wired in place. Each one supports a different closed book.

Images of Eve and the Serpent to the left of the Rose window are balanced by images of Adam and Eve to the right.},emperor,{@pemit %#=%rLooking up, one of the windows catches your attention. A series of 20 windows marches along the Arcade. Each is a depiction of one of the Holy Roman Emperors in their royal robes - crowned, haloed, with Latin blessings worked into the glass. Forming the background image to each ruler are tiny geometric glass shapes reprersenting windows and arches - as if each Emperor himself posed before a stained-glass window.},tree,{@pemit %#=%rLooking up, one of the windows catches your attention. Cerulean and dark ruby, patched together with green and white and a touch of goldenrod yellow form the colored pieces of one Nave window. Each of the panels in the tall pointed window are seperated by stone tracery - slender carved stone supports. An adaption of the Chartres 'Jesse Tree', it shows a pictoral genealogy of Christ from King David to Joseph, each male member shown on a seperate flowering branch of the tree. Jesus, himself, is seated cross-legged in the center. Light streams in through the window, backlighting it brilliantly, till it almost glows.},{@pemit %#=%rPlease specify which window you want to see: the 'rose window', the 'tree window', the 'emperor window' or the 'triple window'.%r}},{@pemit %#=You're not close enough to the Nave to look at the windows.}

&VIEW_CRUCIFIX here=%rEighty feet above the floor of the Chancel spans a wide arch, the point of which supports the base of the tall hardwood cross with a carved-ivory corpus in larger-than-life detail. The arch arcs OVER the altar area, so that the crucifix floats seemingly in midair, rather than on the wall. Christ rests wearily against the heavy wooden cross, His pale limbs barely draped with a bit of rag carved into soft folds. His palms and overlapped feet are pierced with dark nails (which appear to be faintly stained red, but that could be a trick of the light). Scrolled above His thorn-crowned head are the letters "INRI". His face has a decidedly Semetic cast to it, and the ivory has yellowed with age, a fair indication that the corpus was carved many centuries ago. Seasonal colored cloth hangings with simple pictoral images and text messages flutter below either side of the base of the cross.%r
&VIEW_CANDELABRAS here=%rTwelve standing candelabras made of bronze and tipped with silver are set into specially designed niches along the length of the building. All these 8 foot candelabras were obviously gifts to the Church from a noble in the distant past, and preserved till they were placed in this cathedral. Each bears a distinctive coat of arms that is worked several times into the base plates. Ten of these massive pieces can hold up to 12 candles each on their tiered outspread arms. Two larger than the rest can hold up to 18 candles in such a way to maximize the spread of their light to the surrounding altar area where they have been placed. Each has a fine etching of fleur-de-lis into the silver that surrounds the base cuff and the arms of the candle-holders. A slight crimping in a few portions of the fleur-de-lis patterns and coats-of-arms are the only indication that these have been restored from some previously unseemly state.%rRestoration, courtesy Tawny Alexander%r
&VIEW_BAPTISMAL-FONT here=%rLooking through the grilled gate locking the baptismal chapel you see a large copper bowl resting comfortably on its base of clawed feet. This was used by priests to baptize people on the battlefield before combat during the Dark Ages. A man could immerse himself to the waist when standing in it while it was filled. Now it has the more peaceful obligation of being used in modern infant and adult baptisms. Almost worn away is a faint, half-discernable pattern of diamonds that are etched into its outer surface. One foot has been replaced with a newer and harder copper that practically matches the color of the older copper. Portions of its curving lip are penny bright with replacement material while other portions are darker but still brightly-polished copper from many centuries ago.%rRestoration, courtesy Tawny Alexander%r
