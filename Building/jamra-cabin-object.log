@Desc lc=%r[space(5)]An interesting stone and wood cabin triangulated between another cabin, and a stream. At the back is a single twelve-foot water wheel that turns with the current of the stream. This building is small enough to only house one person, or, it might be a guest cabin. It has a porch that partially wraps around the sides of the cabin, with grilled windows on three sides. The outer stone wall opposite the wall with the wheel supports a stone chimney. Overall, it's rather snug and sturdy looking.%r%r[space(5)]Scattered in quaint little groupings are growing circles filled with roses, carnations, tulips, and dark purple lilies, each nook deeply banked with straw during the colder months. Jasmine shrubs grow beneath each of the windows.%r
@Idesc lc=%r[space(5)]The interior of this retreat is designed to be colorful and comfortable, with something of a Middle Eastern flair. Below, overlapping fringed rugs of soft bright wool pad the floor. Above, the high ceiling and sturdy walls have been covered with stucco panels that are painted with floral and geometric designs alternated with bands of Arabic calligraphy. The large windows have been covered with fretwork screens shaped into keyhole openings to add another exotic detail. A winding staircase of recycled iron pipes leads up to a loft with a sleeping area, bathroom, and bookcases. Knotted to the railing are vivid silk scarves whose edges are trimmed with tiny silver bells. The bells chime with movement on the stairs.%r%r[space(5)]The large, open space includes a seating area with low backless chairs, a pair of divan-style love seats, and colorful silken cushions. There's also a kitchen with an outdated gas stove and minimal appliances. The floor here is made up of alternating small tiles of blue and orange. Dominating the center of the east wall is a fireplace of local grey stone above a raised hearth.
