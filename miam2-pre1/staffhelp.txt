 This is an alphabetical listing of all terms used elsewhere in this
 command set.  Use it to look up something which doesn't make sense. 
 Note that this +shelp section has 9 pages in it.
 
 <ability name>
     The name of the ability to add (ie: Animal Ken).  Note that several
     symbols are not allowed in ability names.
     These include: ( ) * / - + @ < > ^ | : 

 <ability to check>
     The ability which will be looked at to determine if the character
     has access to the restricted ability.

 <ability to restrict>
     The ability which will now have limited access by characters during
     the chargen process.

 <description>
     This section is a description of the ability, what it gives the
     possessor of the ability.  Note that while the examples use very
     short descriptions, the description can actually be much longer.

 <explanation required>
     This tells if an explanation is required when this ability is chosen
     in chargen.  Valid choices here are 'Yes' or 'No'.

 <function>
     This particular item is possibly the most complex item in all of chargen.
     Usually, it will be very simple in usage, though it can become extremely
     complex.  Basic usage would be (for example) when a Vampire resets
     his/her Courage, and Willpower must be reset.  This is done by adding
     Courage and Self Control.  For this example, a valid function would be:
 
         courage+self_control
 
 {continued in '+shelp abils definitions3'}
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-> End: Abilities Help <--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

& abils definitions3
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-> Abilities Help <--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--
     Note the use of an '_' character in Self Control. No spaces are allowed
     in ability names, nor are any other math symbols (or internal symbols).
     These include: ( ) * / - + @ < > ^ | :
     More complex functions are allowed.  However, these expressions must
     be completely parenthesized. This means that you may not use such
     expressions as:
 
         courage+conscience+self_control
 
     However, you may use:
 
         (courage+conscience)+self_control
 
     Note, though, that you must not put () around the entire expression,
     meaning that this is invalid:
 
         ((courage+conscience)+self_control)
 
 {continued in '+shelp abils definitions4'}
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-> End: Abilities Help <--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

& abils definitions4
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-> Abilities Help <--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--
     The following symbols may be used in building your function:
         ()  Used to surround a sub-expression in your function.
         ^   Used to raise something to a power (exponent).
         *   Used to multiply two terms together.
         /   Used to divide one term by another.
         +   Used to add two terms together.
         -   Used to subtract one term from another. Note that there is
             *NO* negative, this is exclusively a minus sign.

 <function number>
     Each trigger ability can have up to 5 lookups and 5 functions
     performed when it is set.  This is useful for (for example)
     Changelings.  When a Changeling sets his/her Seeming, his/her
     Willpower, Banality, and Glamour are all also set.  Each of
     these is a separate lookup.
 
 {continued in '+shelp abils definitions5'}
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-> End: Abilities Help <--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

& abils definitions5
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-> Abilities Help <--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--
 <lookup list>
     This list must be in a very specific format, or else it will fail.
     First, every item in the list must be a value which may be chosen
     in chargen. If it is not, the lookup list will not be set. Second,
     the list must look like this:
 
         item1|value1^item2|value2^etc
 
     Due to server limits, no more than 10 item|value pairs may be set up
     at a time.  If you have more than 10 item|value pairs, use a second
     or third lookup list. An example lookup list would be one that is used
     for Garou when they select their tribe.  If Black Furies get a
     Willpower of 3, and Bone Gnawers get a Willpower of 2, and these are
     the only tribes allowed, then this would be a valid lookup list:
 
         Black Fury|3^Bone Gnawers|2
 
     Also valid would be:
 
 {continued in '+shelp abils definitions6'}
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-> End: Abilities Help <--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

& abils definitions6
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-> Abilities Help <--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--
         Bone Gnawers|2^Black Fury|3
 
     As you can, see, order doesn't matter. To use the first lookup list
     and put it in the whole command, making it the first lookup performed,
     this would be used:
  
         +abils/lookup Garou:Tribe:Willpower:1:Black Fury|3^Bone Gnawers|2

 <lookup number>
     Each trigger ability can have up to 5 lookups and 5 functions
     performed when it is set.  This is useful for (for example)
     Changelings.  When a Changeling sets his/her Seeming, his/her
     Willpower, Banality, and Glamour are all also set.  Each of

 <modify ability>
     When a player goes through chargen, setting certain abilities causes
     others to be changed.  For instance, when a mortal sets his/her
     Conscience, his/her Humanity must be recalculated.  In this example,
     Conscience is the trigger ability, and Humanity is the modify
     ability.  Note that these are used exclusively in chargen, and not
     at all by the +set command.

 <option nummber>
     A number from 1 to 5.

 <option type>
     Either 'lookup','compute', or 'restrict'

 <parent skill>
     Some skills require you to have another before you can purchase them.
     As an example, Singing might require Performing.  The parent skill
     is the skill one must have before purchasing this skill in chargen.

 <race>         
     This is the name of an already existing race which will get access
     to this ability. Specifying 'Base' will give all races access to
     this ability

 <restriction number>
     A number from 1 to 5.

 <restrictions>
     The values which can be chosen during chargen which will let the
     character have access to the restricted ability. This list is
     separated by the | symbol.  An example list would be:
            Get of Fenris|Glass Walkers|Red Talons
 
 <section>
     This is the section of the character sheet this skill belongs on.
     For instance, Strength belongs on Phys-Attrs. Setting this
     correctly helps the +sheet command work much better in the long run.

     Conscience is the trigger ability, and Humanity is the modify

 +abils/del <race>:<ability name>
     Remove ability name from <race>'s list of abilities.  Note that
     this does NOT remove it selectively.  In other words, if the
     knowledge 'Rituals' is on the race 'Betebase', you may not prevent
     Garou from having this knowledge by typing in
     '+abils/del garou:rituals'.  You MUST remove it from Betebase,

    This command lets you specify a default cost for an ability.  For
    instance, if virtually everybody who takes 'Alertness' for 3 points,
    then setting a default cost of 3 points would mean that unless the
    player specifies something different, he/she will get 3 points of
    Alertness.

 +abils/frcost <race>:<ability name>:<freebie cost>
    This command lets you set how much a specific ability should cost
    (in freebie points) to be raised one point with freebies.  For
    instance, Gnosis (for the shifters) requires 2 freebies to go up one
    point, but is in the pools section, which normally requires one freebie
    to go up one point.  This lets individual abilities be different.
 
 +abils/parent <race>:<ability name>:<parent skill>
    Sets the parent skill for the ability.  Note that leaving the parent
    skill blank removes the parent skill
 
 +abils/section <race>:<ability name>:<section>
    This command lets you say that even though an ability is in one section,
    it should draw points from some other section.  For instance, Gypsies
    have an ability called 'Element', which belongs in the top section.
    However, this ability should take its points from freebie points.

 +abils/lookup  <race>:<trigger ability>:<modify ability>:<lookup number>:
                <lookup list>

 +abils/restrict <race>:<ability to restrict>:<ability to check>:
                <restriction number>:<restrictions>

      to everybody.  The only values which can be chosen during chargen
      are the numbers 1 through 5.  When taking this ability, the player
      does not need to provide an explanation for the ability.  There is
      no ability which must be purchased before this ability may be
      purchased.  This ability belongs in Talents.  It also has a
      description (and therefore, a +explain) of 'Seeing things'.
 
  +abils/add mage:Essence:Infinite|Questing:No::Top:Your essence
      This command adds the ability 'Essence', making it available to
      mages only.  The only values which can be chosen during chargen
      are 'Infinite' and 'Questing'.  When taking this ability, the
      player does not need to provide an explanation for the ability.
      There is no ability which needs to be purchased before this
      ability may be purchased.  This ability belongs in the top
      section of the character sheet.  It also has a description (and

      is 1.  When taking this ability, the player needs to provide an
      explanation for it (in this case, what is the player afraid of?).
      There is no ability which must be purchased before this ability
      may be purchased.  This ability belongs in the flaws section of

      a +explain) of 'What are you afraid of?'.
  
  +abils/add garou:Silver Tolerance:5|7:No::Merits:You're immune to silver
      This command adds the ability 'Silver Tolerance', making it
      available to garou only.  The only values which may be chosen
      during chargen are 5 and 7.  When taking this ability, the
      player does not need to provide an explanation for this ability.
      There is no ability which needs to be purchased before this
      ability may be purchased.  This ability belongs in the Merits

  +abils/lookup Garou:Tribe:Willpower:1:Black Fury|3^Bone Gnawers|2
      This command adds a lookup list, so that whenever a Garou going
      through chargen sets his/her tribe to either 'Black Fury' or
      'Bone Gnawers', his/her willpower is also reset to 3 or 2,
      respectively.

 Now is where I've got to explain a little bit.  There's some heavy
 restrictions on the <function> part of +abils/compute.  This is due
 to two things: my limitations, and the limitations of mux to do more.
 I WILL try to improve it in the future, but not for a very long time.
 Please don't ask me to, as it will only irritate me, and frustrate
 you.  I'm sorry for sounding so uncaring here, but I KNOW this will
 be a question which many will ask.  All I can say is that if you
 don't have enough of a math background to construct those <function>'s,
 please find somebody who does.  It's not terribly abnormal for math.
 It just looks that way to non-math people.
 
 Thank you.

==============================================================================
          Configuration Parameters for Myrddin's Bulletin Board 4.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two types of configuration parameters: global and group.  Global
configuration parameters affect the BB system as a whole, while group 
configuration parameters affect a single Group.
To set a global parameter:
  
     +bbconfig <param>=<value>       Sets global config parameter.
  
Global Parameters:
  
     timeout            This sets the default timeout (in days) for any new
                          groups created. A timeout of '0' means messages
                          won't timeout. (ex. +bbconfig timeout=30)
     autotimeout        If you don't have a way to trigger the TR_TIMEOUT
                          attribute on the bbpocket (daily) to clean out
                          expired messages, you can use the autotimeout param
                          instead. Setting this param 'on' enables the BB's
                          built in timer. Set this param to 'off' to disable.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
See '+shelp bbconfig2' for info on Group parameters
==============================================================================

& bbconfig2
==============================================================================
          Configuration Parameters for Myrddin's Bulletin Board 4.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To set a Group parameter:
  
     +bbconfig <#>/<param>=<value>   Sets config parameter for board <#>.
  
Group Parameters:
  
     anonymous          Setting this value turns the Group 'anonymous'.  This
                          means that any future posting's 'Author' field will
                          have the value of this param instead of the name of
                          the author. Wizards will also see the actual name of
                          author.  (examples:

& chargen
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--> CharGen +Help <--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 This character generation system is fairly unique in many ways.
 
 1) Every race has what is called a base race.  This race may even be the
    race named 'Base'.  This race has things which are common to %xhall%xn
    races.  As an example, anotehr race named 'BeteBase' might be created,
    which would be a base race for all shapeshifters, and have all the
    things which make the shifters unique.  From there, Garou, Bastet,
    Gurahl, etc, would be created.  BeteBase would have its base race set
    to 'Base', which has things which are common to %xhall%xn characters.
 2) Setting which races can be used in chargen.  For instance, nobody
    should ever be set to be 'Base' for the race type.
 3) Setting which races are apponly.  On a mage dominated mux, mages should
    be able to be made as easily as walking into chargen.  This is user
    settable which ones can be easily done, and which ones need to applied
    for.

& chargen problems
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-> CharGen Problems +Help <--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--
 A few issues exist in this chargen which to resolve would have made
 more problems than would have been solved.
 
 1) Gypsies, when they take an element, spend 7 freebies.  If they
    reset their element, they spend ANOTHER 7 freebies. I couldn't
    find a way to make this chargen handle this problem correctly.
 2) Shapeshifters and Mages have restrictions in one area placed on
    them by another area.  Shapeshifters may not take rites at a
    level above their skill in Rituals, and Mages may not take
    Spheres(Powers) above their Arete.  The code couldn't be set up
    to handle this without much more problems than it was worth.
 3) Players must have at least as many freebies remaining as the
    flaws they are trying to adjust.  For instance, if they are trying
    to do '+adjust amnesia:2' or '+adjust amnesia:-2', they must have
    at least 2 freebiespoints.  This is due to the fact that if they
    try to do the second one (+adjust amnesia:-2), they may have
    already spent the freebies the flaw gave them.  This prevents
    such a cheat.

     <tribe or ALL> The tribe which gets these adjustments with this form.
                    This option would be used mostly with the Bastet, as
                    certain tribes of Bastet have different form
                    adjustments than other tribes.
     <form name>    This is the name of the form which can be assumed, such
                    as Homid, Crinos, etc.
     <lookup list>  This portion of the command uses the exact same format
                    as '+abils/add'.  See '+shelp abils definitions5' for
                    a full description of how to set this up.  This is
                    simply a list of all stats which change from homid.
                    Note that you should specify all attributes which
                    change in ANY form, so as to avoid accidentally having
                    a player get the wrong stats for a form.
 +forms/del <race>:<tribe or ALL>:<form name>
     This uses the same format as above, but is used to delete a form.
 +forms/list <race>:<tribe or ALL>
     This produces a listing of available forms.

Usage: +map/create
 
 Creates a map from the MUSHes' data that features all streets (all those
 that can be reached from other streets, starting at MAP_CENTRE. MAP_CENTRE
 must be set to your first IC street; it is located on the 'map' object).
 Positions X/Y/Z will be added on all street objects (Z is for sewers, caves
 or other things that make your map 3D).
 
 NOTE: All streets will be @chown'd to a builder character named the same
       as the MUSH (as returned by the mudname() function). It is a good
       idea to alias this builder "MUSH".
 
 !!!!  WARNING:  Since this character now owns your grid, it is *vital*
                 for her not to get idle-nuked after grid-"completion!"
 
                     @set MUSH=staff
 
                 will do the job.  Do it *now*!
 
 NOTE: For a place to be recognized as a street, it has to be accessible
       from another street going north, south, east, west, up, down,
       northwest, northeast, southwest or southeast.  These exits are
       also required by +compass.
 
 NOTE: For the +map command to be able to determine which street the

 The first form informs <player> that a call is waiting for them;
 PHONE_PENDING will be set on either party containing the dbref of
 the other. Any previous PHONE_PENDING will be cleared on the caller
 (as if they'd hung up before calling). The receiving party will have
 PHONE_ANS set (this is required so that the caller cannot use +answer,
 s/b, after a +dial to force the recipient to pick up the phone).
 
 The second form will try to answer the call; if the recipient's
 PHONE_PENDING points to a party whose PHONE_PENDING references
 them back, PHONE_PENDING is cleared on the both parties; instead,
 PHONE will be set with the othe party's dbref.  If PHONE_PENDING
 on the alleged caller is unset or set to another dbref, they have
 given up on the recipient and called/tried to call another party.
 PHONE_ANS is then cleared.
 
 The third form clears PHONE on both if a line is up; otherwise,
 PHONE_PENDING is cleared on the enactor.
 
 The forms of the fourth form reset PHONE_ANS on the enactor, and
 PHONE_PENDING on both parties (caller only if still equal to enactor).
 
 The @adisconnect on the phone clears PHONE, PHONE_PENDING and
 PHONE_ANS on each player disconnecting from the game.
 
 "+dial" is aliased to "call" and "+phone " for convenience/compatibility.
 "+psay" is aliased to "+talk" for the same reason.

 +stats/list [<player>]
 +stats [<player>/][<section>]
 
 This command lists individual sections of the character sheet.
  
 A list of valid sections can be obtained using the first form of
 the command (for a particular player if given).
  
 The second form shows a section (defaults to the primary attributes)
 for a specific player (defaults to yourself).  If both a player and
 a section are given, they must be separated using the : or the /
 character.

& taxi
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-> +taxi +Help <--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 Usage: +taxi
 
 In addition to hailing a taxi, this will also tell you how many and which
 cabs are free.  Use this for analysis if a player complains that they can
 never get a cab.  If in doubt, create another taxi; instructions are set
 on the taxi-parent.
 
 TAXI_PARENT on the CInfo-object must be set with the dbref of the parent
 for taxis.
 
 While the taxi is going places in 'driveto' mode, ROUTE (on the taxi-child)
 will contain the dbrefs of the places the taxi yet has to go to. This list
 of course will get progressively shorter.
 
 In 'cruise' mode, the taxi constantly re-checks which places are busy (in
 case someone's moved), and will then randomly pick on of those locations
 and go (@tel) there.

& time
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-> +time +Help <--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 Usage: +time \[<player>|mush\] (player-level command)
 
 The first form gives the time and date in the game world (IC time)
 as well as the phase of the moon for our shiftery friends.
 (Code-wizzies: For this, FN_GAMETIME is evaluated; if you have Keran's
 time and weather-thingie, that's where to plug it in.)
 
 The second time gives the Real Life time for where the MUSH server
 is; this is useful since "Last logged..." times in +finger <player>
 and @mail datestamps are in MUSH time rather than converted to your
 local time.
 
 The last form gives the local time where <player> is in Real Life.
 For this to work, the player must have a valid timezone set:
 
    &TIMEZONE me=CET
    &TIMEZONE me=1
 
 Both examples would indicate you in the Central-European timezone;
 the first by name (note: if the MUSH doesn't recognize the name,
 it will default to GMT -- that's right, it's still GMT, not UTC),
 the second one by an offset to GMT (Greenwich Mean Time, or UTC).
 This offset may be a positive or negative float (1,-7,+1.5 etc.).
 
 This code uses MIAM's TIMEZONES list and its MUSHTIME offset.
 The numeric value for TIMEZONE is not interprete by MIAM and should
 therefore only by used in special cases.
 
 TIMEZONES is a list of timezones (TZAbbrev:TZFullName:OffsetGMTInSecs)
 set on the MIAM:MFDO.  MUSHTIME is an attribute indicating the MUSH-clock's
 offset to GMT in seconds.  It too is set on the MIAM:MFDO.  TIMEZONE is
 a variable described above that can be set by the individual player to
 indicate their RL location.  The TIMEZONES list is by no means complete,
 so expect players to request their timezone be added.

 This chargen, as you can already see, is a fairly complex one.  As
 such, I'm providing a step by step example of how I added the Mage
 race into chargen, making it ready for players to use.
 
 Please read, before reading this tutorial, '+shelp set',
 '+shelp sections', '+shelp abils', and '+shelp race'.

Notice that the spells listed in the Mage 2nd Edition book were NOT
added at any time. If those are to be added, please feel free to add
them in now, using the same type of command as has been used above.
 
Notice also that Leadership was added to Mages.  Leadership gets
placed in different sections for different races (Garou and other
shifters have it as a skill, Kindred have it as a Talent, Mages as a
skill).  As such, it must be added individually to each race.
 
The next group of commands is the worst part of the entire chargen
process.  They all make reference to 'magedbref'.  To find this dbref,
type '+race/list', and look for Mage.  The dbref will be in the parentheses
beside 'Mage'.  In the following commands, use that dbref wherever
you see 'mage dbref'.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-> +vote +Help <--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 The VOTE_HANDLER must be put in the crontab
 (%xh@daily cinfo=@trigger me/vote_handler%xn). It gets the time information
 for the players from the loggin-object's data-files.
 
 XP on the player object are updated through VOTE_HANDLER each RL day --
 VOTE_CYCLE indicates only how many days you have to wait before voting
 for the same person again; this value is internally converted to seconds
 by VOTE_HANDLER.  This XP update considers three factors:  idle hours
 multiplied by the XP_PER_IDLE factor;  busy hours multiplied by the
 XP_PER_BUSY factor, and votes multiplied by the XP_PER_VOTE factor.
 The handler scans for players who have voted, as indicated by the
 VOTES-list set on the voting player (#dbref_voted_for:secs()_when_voting).
 It will then filter() this list through FN_VOTEEXPIRY which will process
 votes cast over VOTE_CYCLE days ago and let younger votes remain untouched.
 The vote-processing credits the voted for player with XP_PER_VOTE XP and
 removes the vote from the voter's VOTES-list.
 
 XP_PER_IDLE credits general (theoretical) availability for RP.  Since many
             people are logged in even when busy at work, this value is
             usually minute.
 XP_PER_BUSY credits activity in the MUSH (RP as well as descing etc.).
             In theory, XP_PER_VOTE could be set to zero and all XP could
             be handled through activity, but players would likely get cross
             or might try to simulate activity with client-side spoofs.
 XP_PER_VOTE credits each "Good RP!"-vote of confidence given by another
             player.
