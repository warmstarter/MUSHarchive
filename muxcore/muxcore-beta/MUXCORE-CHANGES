MUX Core 1.0 Beta 1
--------------------------
Thanks to everyone who helped me track down and squash bugs, especially Kat, who
probably accounts for about half the bugs on the list solo.

	New Features
	------------
*	Places have been completely rewritten. Please see the relevant help files.

*	I have added Meta Rooms code. For the quick intro, see +help metarooms/explained.

*	Two new functions have been added, UPDATE() and ACCESS() Mostly they're to
	support some external code I'm writing, but I saw no reason not to include
	them. Docs are in +shelp functions.
	
*	The underlying jobs code is now Anomaly Jobs 6.1. Anomaly Jobs is included
	under the GNU GPL.
	
*	I've changed the format of the distribution file a bit to hopefully make it
	easier for people on multiple platforms. The previous distribution file was
	difficult to work with in Windows. Note that Windows users should stick to
	db_load'ing the included flatfile, because the installation source relies on
	being able to do a few @restarts.
	
*	I have included the ./Backup script (for Unix-based systems) in the distribution
	file. The only change is that $TEXT/jhelp.txt has been added to be included
	in the backup.

	Bug Fixes
	------------

*	The room parent has been changed around to allow it to show longer exit
	names. It now tries to fit exits in two columns instead of three.

*	+Staff was showing #-1 NO MATCH with more than one staffer was online, because
	the wrong delimiter had been specified.

*	The uselock on the Staff Globals Object has been changed to allow staff-owned
	objects to execute staff commands.

*	Cron jobs were not firing. The code was originally written for another game
	and the attributes were name CRON_ to fit with the attribute naming scheme
	on that game. In my own code I use CRON. but I forgot to edit the code.

*	+who was incorrectly showing 8 people online.

*	Using the +view command on a room was not working due to a typo.

*	The Build and Staff nexuses has the same keyword (Nexus). I've removed that
	keyword from both exits.

*	The Public and Guests channels are now @cset public on creation. New players
	were not able to see the channels in @clist.

*	A vampire tag that I'd been using for code testing snuck through on #5.
	It's been removed. This was a remnant from an older working version of tags,
	and taglists are now stored on the Staff Globals Object (#8).
	
*	The lcstr() around %1 in the HASTAG function (#5/FPRIV.HASTAG) is unnecessary.
	The softcoded ismember() function (#5/FN.ISMEMBER) is not case sensitive. An
	older version of the function was.

*	Moving the ROLLXDY() function to the Global Functions object was a last minute
	thing from a set of testing dice code I had. I neglected to consider that, being
	a global @function, it would execute with the permissions of the player and try
	to pull their D.MAXFACES and D.MAXDICE attributes instead of the ones on the
	global object. The v()s have been changed to get(#5/) and the necessary attributes
	are now set VISUAL.

*	The "You must control %0." lines have been removed from +shelp file for the
	tags functions. This was based on an older test version where non-staff players
	could see the tags on objects they control. This functionality was removed to make
	tags more focused on being a staff-only info system.

*	There were unnecessary colors around the subheader() in +finger.
