To remind everyone how to write a command, how to use [] to<br/>force evaluation of a function (in this case, the 'v()' function,<br/>which is essentially the same as 'get(me/whatever)') and to set the<br/>stage for more advanced examples."<br/><br/>Parity says, "Does anyone, even those of you that think you're just<br/>lurking, have any question about this example?"<br/><br/>Moth ugs... works on this a moment....<br/><br/>Parity says, "If everyone drops their object, I can examine it and give<br/>guidance."<br/><br/>Roswind doesn't think, she knows ;)<br/><br/>Roswind pats the dragon's shoulder and moves away from it.<br/><br/>Moth sets Prospero down.<br/><br/>The big inflated dragon starts drifting across the room.<br/><br/>Prospero wiggles his way off of Moth and across the floor in search of raisins.<br/><br/>Moth's Prospero:<br/>REMEMBER-CMD:$.remember *:&amp;memory-string me=%0 ; @pemit %#=Ok."<br/>REMINDER-CMD:$.reminder:@pemit %#=You asked me to remember: [v(&amp;memory-string me=%0 ; <br/>@pemit %#=Ok.)]<br/><br/>Parityblinks.<br/><br/>Parity says, "Moth, your 'v' command should just be 'v(memory-string)'"<br/><br/>Hercules dropped Bubba.<br/><br/>Parity says, "Err."<br/><br/>Parity says, "I should say, your v -function-."<br/><br/>Moth nods, thought I misunderstood that... will do it<br/><br/>Hercules' Bubba:<br/>REMEMBER-CMD:$.remember *:&amp;memory-string me=%0 ; @pemit %#=Ok<br/>REMINDER-CMD:$.reminder:@pemit %#=You asked me to remember [v(memory-string)]<br/>MEMORY-STRING:The secret number is 7<br/><br/>Parity says, "Both Bubba and the Dragon have it right if you need to look at it. <br/>Good job, Herc, Ros. ;)"<br/><br/>Moth nods, just thought I was supposed to "fill that bit in"...<br/><br/>Parity will use ... or &lt;&gt; for 'fill this in'<br/><br/>Moth says, "Oh good... thanks..."<br/><br/>Parity says, "To review briefly, a function is a special string that the<br/>MUSH evaluates and replaces with some other string."<br/><br/>Hercules says, "Do these strings also work in MUX?"<br/><br/>Parity says, "A function can appear as the first thing in a string that the<br/>mush is evaluating, as in 'say time()' or can be appear later in that<br/>string wrapped in square brackets [] to say 'evaluate this specially!'<br/>like 'say The time is [time()]'"<br/><br/>Parity says, "Yes."<br/><br/>Parity says, "Everything I teach you works in TinyMUSH, TinyMUX and PennMUSH."<br/><br/>Parity says, "When we come across discrepancies I'll try to point out the<br/>cross-platform differences."<br/><br/>Hercules says, "Cool!"<br/><br/>Parity says, "So far, the only difference we'd see doing this elsewhere is<br/>that, on pennmush, we'd have to say, '@set MyObj=!no_command' instead<br/>of '@set MyObj=commands'"<br/><br/>Parity says, "But I wasn't really teaching flags, just getting you an<br/>object to work with, so. :)"<br/><br/>Moth chuckles<br/><br/>Hercules nods.;)<br/><br/>Moth's Prospero:<br/>REMEMBER-CMD:$.remember *:&amp;memory-string me=%0 ; @pemit %#=Ok."<br/>REMINDER-CMD:$.reminder:@pemit %#=You asked me to remember: [v(memory-string)]<br/><br/>Moth says, "Oh woo..."<br/><br/>Parity says, "Okay. So. You can put functions inside of any string<br/>evaluated by MUSH. You cannot, however, put -commands- in the middle<br/>of strings. THey have to go in very particular places.

I got it"<br/><br/>Parity says, "Herc, try '.write test=this is a test' and '.read test'"<br/>Parity says, "It should work."<br/><br/>Moth says, "Can you insert %r to make little stanzas?"<br/><br/>Parity copied the code onto its 'myobj' and it worked.<br/><br/>Hercules says, "Nope. Still get 'Huh?'"<br/><br/>Parity blinks?<br/><br/>Hercules says, "Is my .read command alright?"<br/>Parity nods...<br/>Parity says, "Hold on."<br/>Parity hrmmmms.<br/>Parity says, "Herc, are you typing 'read' or '.read' ?"<br/><br/>Hercules says, ".read"<br/><br/>Parity says, "And '.read test' doesn't work for you?"<br/><br/>Hercules says, "Ohh! I was just typing '.read'. Sorry.:)"<br/><br/>Parity ahhhs.<br/><br/>Hercules----&gt; Having yet another blonde day.<br/><br/>Parity notes the pattern for .read is '.read *' ... in command<br/>patterns, spaces -are- significant, so '.read' doesn't match '.read '<br/>followed by anything because there's no space there.<br/><br/>Parity says, "You can, and people often do, make a command like<br/>'$read-what-cmd myobj=$.read:@pemit #384=Read what?'"<br/><br/>Parity says, "That will match '.read' by itself and remind you to give<br/>.read an argument. :)"<br/><br/>Moth ahhhhhhs<br/><br/>Parity says, "Err."<br/>Parity says, "With a %#, not with my dbref. ;o"<br/><br/>Moth grins<br/><br/>Parity says, "Okay."<br/>Parity says, "SO we have a .read that kinda works, but what we really want<br/>is to use our borders-fn, with our %0 argument for the header and our<br/>retrieved text inside the lines."<br/>Parity says, "So, try changing your .read commands to do that."<br/><br/>Hercule's Bubba:<br/>READ-CMD:$.read *:@pemit %#=v(memory-%0-string)<br/><br/>Moth's Prospero:<br/>     Missing Space is Between @pemit and %#<br/>                       |<br/>                       v<br/>READ-CMD:$.read *:@pemit%#=u(borders-fn,Sonnet to The Ferretess Gwendolyn,v(memory-%0-string))<br/><br/>Moth says, "Okie..."<br/><br/>Parity says, "You're missing a space, Moth, and your header is going to be<br/>a fixed string, so when you '.read test' it'll have the same header as<br/>when you '.read poem'."<br/><br/>Moth caught the space thing... how's it look now?<br/><br/>Parity says, "Halfway there. ;)"<br/><br/>Moth hmmmmms<br/><br/>Parity says, "But, try, for example, '.write phonenum=123-4567' and '.read phonenum' ..."<br/><br/>&gt; .read phonenum<br/>---------------------- Sonnet to The Ferretess Gwendolyn ---------------------<br/>123-4567<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Moth says, "Oh...."<br/><br/>Parity says, "You might want to have %0 instead of a fixed string for your<br/>title. ;)"<br/><br/>Moth nods<br/><br/>Parity checks on Hercules, "Still with us?"<br/><br/>Moth thinks I got it.<br/><br/>Moth's Prospero: <br/>READ-CMD:$.read *:@pemit %#=u(borders-fn,%0,v(memory-%0-string))<br/><br/>&gt; .read test<br/>------------------------------------ test ------------------------------------<br/>This is a test.<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>&gt; .read phonenum<br/>---------------------------------- phonenum ----------------------------------<br/>123-4567<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Parity says, "Looks good, moth!"<br/>Parity says, "Now, to make it a bit more useful, try this:"<br/><br/>Hercules says, "Yep.:)"<br/>Hercules says, "Just had to run AFK for a sec."<br/><br/>Parity says, "&amp;space2tilde-fn myobj=edit(%0,%b,~)"<br/>Parity says, "And,"<br/>Parity says, "&amp;tilde2space-fn myobj=edit(%0,~,%b)"<br/><br/>'MyObj':<br/>WRITE-CMD:$.write *=*:&amp;memory-%0-string me=%1 ; @pemit %#=Ok.<br/>READ-CMD:$.read *:@pemit %#=u(borders-fn,%0,v(memory-%0-string))<br/><br/>Parity says, "Then change 'memory-%0-string' in write-cmd to 'memory-<br/>[u(space2tilde-fn,%0)]-string'"<br/><br/>Hercules is catching up.

Just use say or @emit instead of @pemit... "<br/><br/>Parity wonders if we lost Hercules?<br/><br/>Moth nods, was thinking that'd be it ;)<br/><br/>Parity says, "Any-way. You can read the help on edit() and do 'exa<br/>myobj/*-string' to see how we're replacing spaces with tildes so that<br/>a multi-word string turns into a one-word string."<br/><br/>Moth ahhhhhs<br/><br/>Moth says, "Very cool :)"<br/><br/>Parity says, "And yes, we could've just put edit() inside the square<br/>brackets [] in our .read and .write commands instead of making a<br/>space2tilde and tilde2space function."<br/><br/>Moth nods, is that the preferable way generally speaking?<br/><br/>Parity says, "However, there are a number of pieces of softcode out on the<br/>archives that use a 'space2tilde/tilde2space' type system, so this<br/>lets you see it ahead of time, as it were."<br/><br/>Moth ahs cool<br/><br/>Parity says, "I generally use edit() because using u-fun to replace one<br/>function with another seems a little silly to me."<br/><br/>Moth nods<br/><br/>Parity says, "I usually only use ufuns to replace a whole mess of functions<br/>with one ufun."<br/><br/>Moth nods<br/><br/>Parity says, "Like our borders-fn. That's about the simplest thing I would<br/>make into a ufun, but of course, the other consideration with<br/>borders-fn is that you can use it in many different places."<br/><br/>Hercules says, "It works.:)"<br/><br/>Hercules' Bubba:<br/>MEMORY-STRING:The secret number is 7 and the secret word is please<br/>MEMORY-POEM-STRING:There once was a man from Nantucket...<br/>MEMORY-TEST-STRING:This is a test<br/>MEMORY-MULTI-TITLED~TEST-STRING:This is to see if the command will work.<br/><br/>Parity says, "Cool. ;)"<br/><br/>Moth has seen news files written with that type of bordering and what-not...<br/><br/>Parity says, "That's about that for class then. Question-and-answer time! :)"<br/><br/>Moth grins<br/><br/>Parity says, "Now's the time to speak if anything is still unclear."<br/><br/>Hercules will need to go through the logs of the previous two classes<br/>and get caught up fully. I'm liking this.:)<br/><br/>Moth says, "I think it's pretty clear... you would want to keep the<br/>ufuns down to a dull roar, I imagine? // Yeah, I'll need to read the<br/>log again to come up with anything more ... incisive question-wise,<br/>but this was good. It made the 'u#-1 FUNCTION () NOT FOUND' bit I've<br/>used for years make sense."<br/><br/>Moth oops... laf<br/><br/>Parity notes, btw, that with a little work, some understanding of<br/>lattr() and the use of tilde2space-fn and edit() you can write an<br/>index function for your memory-*-strings, and you can tweak your read<br/>and write functions as you like until you've got a full-fledged<br/>notebook going.<br/><br/>Moth never could type that damn code out<br/><br/>Parity grins.<br/><br/>Moth says, "It's a desc attribute... anyhoo, it makes sense now..."<br/><br/>Parity says, "Use ufuns as much or as little as you like. I tend to be<br/>conservative with them, because they do take extra cycles, -but- they<br/>also tend to make code more readable."<br/><br/>Moth nods...<br/><br/>Moth says, "Cool!"<br/><br/>Hercules can now break through the wet paper bag.<br/><br/>Parity says, "Generally, if your commands are getting to be ten lines long<br/>a ufun might be in order, and also, if you have any code that is<br/>getting used repeatedly, a ufun is good so you don't have to keep<br/>typing it over and over."<br/><br/>Moth says, "This was great, Parity. Thanks:) Another wonderful code<br/>outing...// Ah yes, that would cut down on typo probs"<br/><br/>Parity nods. :)<br/><br/>Hercules thoroughly enjoyed learning this. Thank-you very much,<br/>Parity.:)<br/><br/>Parity says, "You're welcome!"<br/><br/>Prospero dropped Ball.<br/><br/>Houston, we have lift-off. The ferret launches the ball across the room.<br/><br/>Parity chuckles.<br/><br/>Ball has left.<br/><br/>The ferret gets the ball. Clever Prospero!<br/><br/>Prospero dribbles it up the middle like Julius Erving!<br/><br/>Parity says, "Any more questions?"<br/><br/>Moth says, "No, not as of yet..."<br/>Moth says, "Next installment ?"<br/>Moth says, "setq?"<br/><br/>Parity says, "Two weeks, I think, and we'll do setq(), yes. ;)"<br/><br/>Moth says, "Let me know what you want to do and when and I'll post it :0"<br/><br/>Hercules says, "Cool. I'll be out of town next weekend."<br/><br/>Moth says, "Every other week seems to work out alright"<br/><br/>Parity nods, "Every week would be too much for me. ;o"<br/><br/>Moth says, "My brain would explode"<br/><br/>Parity grins.<br/><br/>Moth says, "Just like that guy in Scanners."<br/><br/>Parity says, "Okay, thank you all for coming! I'll be stopping the log now."<br/><br/>Moth says, "Thanks!"<br/>Moth says, "Mucho appreciado..."<br/><br/><br/>
