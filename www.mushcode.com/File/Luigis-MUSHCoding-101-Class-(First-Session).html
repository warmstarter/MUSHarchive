Most of it has<br/>been left in its original state, though some parts of the log were edited<br/>to remove spam or correct a speaker's typo. A '*' has been placed in front<br/>of the speaker's name.<br/><br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>* Luigi says, "One moment and we will begin."<br/>Phoenyx noted none of them mush. thank god. Hated 'em all<br/>Link grins at Rhayden a few minutes before putting on his headphones and watching<br/>Phoenyx.<br/>Phoenyx had a horrible time staying awake at school. Could consume a 2-liter of<br/>mountain dew and fall asleep right after<br/>Rhayden says, ""<br/>Yoda shrugs. Heh, just wanted to see how it turns out.<br/>Rhayden says, "Get more sleep, fool."<br/>Phoenyx says, "My average was 4 hours. some nights less."<br/>Link chuckles and turns up some System of a Down.<br/>* Luigi says, "Alright."<br/>* Luigi begins handing out syllabi.<br/>l<br/>Luigi's Classroom<br/>..is a pit. @Dolists and iter()'s float about, encapsulating each other, and<br/>surrounding and being surrounded by a plethora of other functions and @commands.<br/>It's a mess. Some of the code here is scribbled on walls and notebook paper, while<br/>even more of it is written on the windows with crayons or scratched into the floors.<br/>Madness. You wonder how you'll ever learn how to code now.<br/>Contents:<br/>Yoda<br/>Link<br/>Phoenyx<br/>Illmuri<br/>Rhayden<br/>Kronus<br/>Blackboard<br/>Obvious exits:<br/>&lt;O&gt;ut  <br/><br/>Phoenyx yawn.<br/>Faizah has arrived.<br/>Rhayden says, "Faizah, you made it just in time."<br/>Phoenyx nod, un-nod.<br/>Retrieving a pen from his pencil case, Link begins to dissisemble it, chuckling to<br/>himself over the process. Tearing a small bit off his first blank sheet of paper,<br/>he pops it into his mouth and begins chewing on it.<br/>Faizah's attention will be divided. Blah.<br/>Phoenyx look around, pulls out folder.<br/>Phoenyx look at syllabus, scoff, ditch.<br/>Phoenyx will wait for advanced class :)<br/>Link says, "Woah, hey! an EXAM?!?"<br/>Phoenyx goes home.<br/>Phoenyx has left.<br/>Phoenyx has arrived.<br/>Link says, "NO ONE SAID THERE WAS AN EXAM IN UNIVERSITY!"<br/>Phoenyx chuckle<br/>Tulioz has arrived.<br/>Rhayden throws a blackboard eraser at Phoenyx's head.<br/>Phoenyx duck!<br/>* Luigi says, "Alright, everybody please take a seat."<br/>Shaking his fist, Link arms his spitball shooter and glances around the class for a<br/>likely candidate for being his first victem.<br/>Phoenyx too late, brushes off chalk dust...<br/>Illmuri sloches.<br/>Phoenyx says, "Can I stay for free for amusement value? I know all this schtuff"<br/>* Luigi says, "My name is Lu-i-gi. *begins to write something on the board*"<br/>l<br/>* Luigi writes on the blackboard..<br/>l black<br/>Blackboard(#4216IScSoToTa)<br/>--------------------------------------------------------<br/>0                        Luigi                         - <br/>1                                                      - <br/>2                                                      - <br/>3                                                      - <br/>4                                                      - <br/>5                                                      - <br/>6                                                      - <br/>7                                                      - <br/>8                                                      - <br/>9                                                      -<br/>--------------------------------------------------------<br/>|      chalk &lt;line #&gt;=&lt;message&gt;   erase &lt;line #&gt;       |<br/>--------------------------------------------------------<br/>* Luigi says, "Today's lecture is entitled, "MUSHCoding Fundamentals"."<br/>* Luigi says, "Yes, you may stay Phoenyx."<br/>Phoenyx says, "Thank you sir :)"<br/>Tulioz says, "Yo Loo do use gots any bafrooms?"<br/>* Luigi says, "Graduates of this class may go on to take MUSHCoding 201."<br/>* Luigi says, "You will have to hold it, Tulioz. *acts like all those mean teachers<br/>did in his school days*"<br/>Taking aim at Phoenyx, Link open fires... the small wad of paper flying off through<br/>the air.<br/>* Luigi says, "To begin, what is MUSHCode?"<br/>Rhayden raises his hand<br/>Illmuri says, "the crappiest code ever devised by humands"<br/>Tulioz says, "THis is bull crap Loo, I know mah rights!!!"<br/>Link raises his hand.<br/>* Luigi says, "Rhayden, do you have an answer?"<br/>Link waves his hand around impatiently.<br/>Rhayden says, "MUSHcode is the chaining together of various MUSH commands to<br/>accomplish a given task."<br/>* Luigi says, "Correct. Link?"<br/>Link says, "The type of ceral I had for breakfast this morning!"<br/>Link chuckles to himself.<br/>Phoenyx heh.<br/>Rhayden snicker<br/>* Luigi says, "MUSHCode is the in-game programming language which makes MUSH/MUX<br/>servers unique from all other MU* servers.

But if you wish to see how this is done in a future class, let me know."<br/>* Luigi says, "Now, remember the Functions we discussed?"<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; th add(1,2)<br/>* Luigi says, "And the like."<br/>Kronus nods.<br/>* Luigi says, "Watch this:"<br/>Tulioz says, "#-1 NO PERMISSION TO GET ATTRIBUTE"<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; &amp;getname &lt;name of your object&gt;=$name * age *:say Your name is %0 and<br/>you are %1 years old.;say In ten years you will be [add(%1,10)] years old!<br/>* Luigi says, "Try that (drop it, NAME &lt;a name&gt; AGE &lt;a number&gt;, then pick it up)."<br/>Kronus drops Zero.<br/>Tulioz drops Tul Ownz You.<br/>Tul Ownz You says, "Your name is Zero and you are 1 years old."<br/>Tul Ownz You says, "In ten years you will be 11 years old, you are still an oldie in<br/>mah book."<br/>Zero says, "Your name is Zero and you are 1 years old."<br/>Zero says, "In ten years you will be 11 years old!"<br/>Tulioz says, "Sup"<br/>Faizah drops FizBum.<br/>Faizah takes FizBum.<br/>Tul Ownz You says, "Your name is Faizah and you are 19 years old."<br/>Tul Ownz You says, "In ten years you will be 29 years old, you are still an oldie in<br/>mah book."<br/>Zero says, "Your name is Faizah and you are 19 years old."<br/>Zero says, "In ten years you will be 29 years old!"<br/>Tulioz says, "Word up."<br/>FooFooBunny says, "Your name is Rhayden and you are 22 years old."<br/>FooFooBunny says, "In ten years, according to conventional math, you should be 32<br/>years old."<br/>Kronus takes Zero.<br/>Rhayden takes Tul Ownz You.<br/>Rhayden drops Tul Ownz You.<br/>* Luigi says, "Notice how we used [] around the function. Functions can be placed<br/>inside of a string, but they need to be surrounded by [] if they do not come at the<br/>beginning of the string."<br/>Phoenyx says, "name Phoenyx age ;home"<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say add(1,2)<br/>* Luigi says, "3"<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say HI add(1,2)<br/>* Luigi says, "HI add(1,2)"<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say HI [add(1,2)]<br/>* Luigi says, "HI 3"<br/>(Some object spam removed.)<br/>* Luigi says, "Some people prefer to always use the []'s, it's your choice."<br/>* Luigi says, "These are known as braces. Now.. I am going to show you one last<br/>$-Command."<br/>Tulioz takes Tul Ownz You.<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; &amp;multiply &lt;name of your object&gt;=$multiply * by *:say %0 multiplied<br/>by %1 is [mul(%0,%1)].<br/>* Luigi says, "Add that code to your object, drop it, try it, pick it up please."<br/>* Luigi says, "MULTIPLY &lt;number&gt; by &lt;number&gt;"<br/>Ralph the Object says, "16 multiplied by 2 is 32."<br/>Faizah drops FizBum.<br/>Kronus drops Zero.<br/>FooFooBunny says, "2 multiplied by 2 is 4."<br/>Zero says, "3 multiplied by 4 is 12."<br/>FizBum says, "3 multiplied by 4 is 12"<br/>Zero says, "8 multiplied by 3 is 24."<br/>FizBum says, "8 multiplied by 3 is 24"<br/>Tulioz drops Tul Ownz You.<br/>Faizah takes FizBum.<br/>Kronus takes Zero.<br/>Link types --&gt; I'm Luigi... BLAH BLAH BLAH<br/>* Luigi says, "Are there any questions about all of this?"<br/>Rhayden nein<br/>Link says, "Quineg"<br/>Kronus thinks he has it all<br/>* Luigi says, "Very well, before I announce homework let me answer Link's question<br/>first."<br/>* Luigi says, "Link asked about +view's."<br/>* Luigi says, "+View's are a MUSHCoded system. They are simply Attributes, like we<br/>talked about today, set on a room. Once set, the game knows they are +view's."<br/>Tulioz takes Tul Ownz You.<br/>Link says, "Simply because I was thinking of putting some in my lot and didn't want<br/>to look at the help files."<br/>* Luigi says, "They are set, if you are standing in the room to set them in, with:<br/>&amp;V_&lt;name_of_view&gt; here=&lt;what the view is&gt;"<br/>* Luigi says, "Somebody coded the +VIEW $-command to accept one wildcard, and search<br/>the room for that attribute."<br/>* Luigi says, "Now, for homework I want you to create for me a Calculator. Doesn't<br/>have to be fancy. But I want the following things on it:"<br/>* Luigi says, "* The ability to add, subtract, multiply, and divide 2 numbers. Using 4<br/>$-Commands, and ADD(), MUL, DIV, and SUB."<br/>Tulioz wonders if we get dorm rooms.<br/>* Luigi says, "* The ability to do something else, using one of the functions<br/>described in HELP MATH."<br/>Tulioz has left.<br/>* Luigi says, "If you wish to make a command that multiplies 3 numbers with ADD(),<br/>that will also be counted."<br/>Tulioz has arrived.<br/>* Luigi says, "Thank you for your time. Shall we schedule the next class for next<br/>Tuesday, same time?"<br/>* Luigi says, "I might lower the cost to 1 coin per class."<br/>Rhayden nods.<br/>Kronus nods<br/>Tulioz wishes we could do it on a Thurs.<br/>Kronus stands up on his desk and says "Oh Captain, My Captain!"<br/>* Luigi says, "Oh, one last thing. If you ever need to see the code on your object,<br/>type EXAMINE &lt;name of object&gt;."<br/>* Luigi says, "Please feel free to email me questions, eightbitmush@hotmail.com"<br/>Phoenyx says, "Or @dec (@decompile) Name of object"<br/>Kronus says, "Cool... thanks Luigi"<br/>* Luigi says, "Also, if this seemed too easy for some of you, have patience. It's<br/>just the first class. :)"<br/>* Luigi says, "Thank you all for coming."<br/>* Luigi erases something on the blackboard..<br/>* Luigi erases something on the blackboard..<br/>Kronus claps for Luigi<br/>Rhayden says, "Thank-you for teaching today."<br/>Kronus says, "Yeah thanks"<br/>Tulioz falls asleep.<br/>Phoenyx standing ovation<br/>Kronus is so excited he can hardly standit<br/>A cigarette sounds pretty good right about now.<br/>* Luigi is going to make this class free. Refunds being provided now, thanks to those<br/>of you who paid. Next class bring 1 coin.<br/>* Luigi says, "I think all first classes may be free, possibly."<br/>* Luigi says, "And now, I must flee."<br/>* Luigi has disconnected.<br/>
