        Topic: Zones<br/>Author: Trispis<br/>Summary: Group projects often require multiple players to be able to work<br/>on the same object(s). Use of zones provides a way.<br/><br/>Trispis begins logging.<br/>Trispis begins the lecture.<br/>Trispis says, "I've chosen this particular location for this lecture because<br/>it provides the sort of environment in which zoning is more natural."<br/>Trispis says, "as opposed to a 'lecture hall' or 'classroom'."<br/>Trispis says, "Let's begin by taking a sample scenario..."<br/><br/>Dropped.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Okay... There's my object."<br/>Trispis says, "Now... If I wanted to be able to share control of that object<br/>with the rest of you (I mean total control, not just 'using commands' on it...<br/> I mean adding adding commands, adding attributes, changing details of<br/>description, etc.)... How would I do that?"<br/><br/>David says, "Um, @lock/zone?"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Without zones, the only way to do that is to @chown it to each<br/>of you for the time you want to mess with it."<br/>Trispis says, "Close, David."<br/><br/>Dropped.<br/><br/>Xira says, "put it in a zone (object or room) which is specified to each<br/>user..	or something."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Okay... there's another object, my zmo."<br/><br/>Nhoj adds to Xira, "Or player."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "ZMO stands for Zone Master Object (I'll not rant too much about<br/>the inconsistent usage of the terms 'thing' and 'object'. For the purpose of<br/>this lecture, assume they mean the same thing.)"<br/>Trispis says, "All types of Zones work basically the same way (I'll spell out<br/>the details of differences a bit later), so I'll use this ZMO as a generic<br/>example."<br/>Trispis says, "Everyone here: Please try to put an attribute (named your name)<br/>on 'Sample-Object' (not on the zmo, please). For example:<br/><br/>&amp;david sample-object=Foobar<br/>"<br/><br/>David says, "Didn't work."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "You'll all get the dreaded 'Permission denied.' message, I'd<br/>imagine."<br/><br/>Nhoj nods.<br/><br/>Xira nods<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Okay... Now... I'm going to zone that object to the zmo<br/><br/>@chzone Sample-Object=Sample-ZMO<br/><br/>... then add you all to the @lock/zone of the zmo with...<br/><br/>@lock/zone Sample-ZMO==me|=David|=Xira|=Akiko|=Nhoj<br/>"<br/><br/>ZMOs must be zone-locked before you @chzone!<br/><br/>Locked.<br/><br/>Warning: @chzoning admin-owned object!<br/><br/>Zone changed.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Okay... when I tried to do that (in the order I said), it said<br/>the zmo must be @lock/zone-ed first. so, I had to reverse the order ...  I<br/>locked first, then chzoned."<br/>Trispis says, "Now try adding an attribute to Sample-Object named your name<br/>(as before)."<br/><br/>Akiko says, "Perm D'd."<br/><br/>Xira says, "am I doing something wrong, i keep getting permission denied"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Really?"<br/><br/>Nhoj does too.<br/><br/>David says, "Me too."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "One sec."<br/><br/>Sample-ZMO(#2780n)<br/>Type: Thing Flags: NO_COMMAND<br/>Owner: Trispis	Zone: *NOTHING*  Ducats: 1<br/>Parent: *NOTHING*<br/>Zone Lock: =Trispis(#1623PIOerACMc)|=David(#1907POweACc)|=Xira(#2362PwenACc)|<br/>=Akiko(#1804PXenACc)|=Nhoj(#1906PeACc)<br/>Basic Lock: =Trispis(#1623PIOerACMc)<br/>Powers:<br/>Warnings checked: none<br/>Created: Sat Jul 25 15:09:04 1998<br/>Last Modification: Sat Jul 25 15:09:04 1998<br/>Home: Meeting Room(#1098R)<br/>Location: Meeting Room(#1098R)<br/>Sample-Object(#2779n)<br/>Type: Thing Flags: NO_COMMAND<br/>Owner: Trispis	Zone: Sample-ZMO(#2780n)  Ducats: 1<br/>Parent: *NOTHING*<br/>Basic Lock: =Trispis(#1623PIOerACMc)<br/>Powers:<br/>Warnings checked: none<br/>Created: Sat Jul 25 15:05:41 1998<br/>Last Modification: Sat Jul 25 15:05:41 1998<br/>Home: Meeting Room(#1098R)<br/>Location: Meeting Room(#1098R)<br/><br/>Trispis brings in a test character.<br/><br/>GAME: Joshua has connected.<br/>ZONE: Joshua has connected. (Foyer)<br/>Joshua has arrived.<br/><br/>Xira says, "test char."<br/><br/>Xira leans back in his chair.<br/><br/>Given.<br/><br/>Given.<br/><br/>Joshua found the problem<br/><br/>Joshua drops Sample-Object.<br/><br/>Joshua drops Sample-ZMO.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "the problem was my blasted royalty flag."<br/>Trispis says, "Try now, folks. sorry for the confusion."<br/>Trispis says, "Try to set an attribute on the sample-object."<br/><br/>David says, "It worked! Yay!"<br/><br/>Akiko says, "Set"<br/><br/>Xira does a jig<br/><br/>Trispis says, "man, how embarrassing."<br/><br/>Nhoj cheers!<br/><br/>Xira says, "what happened?"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "I should have remembered that admin-owned restriction."<br/>Trispis says, "Um... You can't play with stuff I own, no matter what... just<br/>because I'm an admin."<br/><br/>Nhoj nods.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "So, I chowned it all to Joshua. (:"<br/><br/>Xira says, "hehe"<br/><br/>David says, "Ah, why don't you tell us about all the restrictions now, then?"<br/><br/>Joshua has disconnected.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Well... I'll get to the restrictions in a minute. Let me finish<br/>the purpose of zones and the various types."<br/>Trispis says, "As you can all now see, the benefit of a zone is that it allows<br/>multiple players to control objects."<br/>Trispis says, "that is... It allows 'group projects'."<br/>Trispis says, "We can all work on this object together, at the same time,<br/>without having to chown it back and forth among us."<br/>Trispis says, "Here's an example of a beneficial use of Zones..."<br/>Trispis says, "Let's say you have several characters (alts) on a game."<br/>Trispis says, "And... one day you hear a report of something being broken on<br/>an object owned by one of your alts, but you don't want to give away your<br/>identity by logging that character in immediately to fix the problem... but<br/>you still wanna fix it."<br/>Trispis says, "You can create zones to achieve the desired end."<br/>Trispis says, "Put all of character A's stuff on a zone and lock that zmo to<br/>all of your alts."<br/>Trispis says, "Likewise for every other character."<br/>Trispis says, "Then, no matter what character is logged in, you have control<br/>of all of their stuffs at once. (:"<br/>Trispis says, "Now..."<br/>Trispis says, "there are 3 types of zones."<br/>Trispis says, "One (which we just used) is the ZMO (or, probably more<br/>tecnically correct, ZMT)... that is, a zone which is controlled by an Object<br/>(or THING)."<br/>Trispis says, "Another, is the ZMR Zone. A zone controlled by a ROOM."<br/><br/>Xira says, "next zmp?"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "And the third is the ZMP Zone, which is controlled by a<br/>PLAYER."<br/>Trispis says, "Each of these has features unique to itself."<br/>Trispis says, "The ZMO Zone (Object/THING-controlled) can have any type of<br/>object zoned to it except a PLAYER."<br/>Trispis says, "Thus, THINGS, ROOMS, and EXITS can all be zoned to a ZMO (or<br/>ZMT)."<br/>Trispis says, "The ZMR Zone is restricted to just objects of type ROOM."<br/>Trispis says, "That is, you can only zone ROOMs to a ZMR."<br/>Trispis says, "Exits and Things cannot be zoned to a ZMR."<br/>Trispis says, "What, you might ask, is the good of a ZMR, then... if it can't<br/>have the other types zoned to it?"<br/>Trispis says, "Well.. the ZMR has the benifit of behaving very similar to the<br/>MUSH's Master Room, in that: All objects dropped in the ZMR become global to<br/>that zone (any room zoned to the ZMR), and thus any $commands on those objects<br/>are 'zone global commands'."<br/><br/>David says, "Cool."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "The ZMO has a similar feature, though. Any $commands on the ZMO<br/>are global to that zone, as well."<br/>Trispis says, "What about the ZMP? What benefits does it offer?"<br/>Trispis says, "The ZMP offers a benefit that can't be had from either of the<br/>other two..."<br/><br/>Nhoj says, "You can have players on the ZMP?"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "In addition to being able to zone all non-PLAYER type objects,<br/>PLAYERS who are on the zonelock of the ZMP can also @chown things directly to<br/>the ZMP, thus immediately adding them to the zone for others to work on."<br/>Trispis says, "No... you can't have PLAYERS on the ZMP."<br/>Trispis says, "Which brings me to restrictions."<br/><br/>Xira says, "so you can make somone take ownership of an object right?"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Ermm... Xira: You can... but only the ZMP. You can only make<br/>the ZMP take ownership."<br/><br/>Xira says, "K"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Some restrictions of zones are as follows..."<br/>Trispis says, "An admin owned object cannot be controlled by anyone,<br/>regardless of the zmo control."<br/><br/>Nhoj says, "What if the ZMO is set ROYALTY or WIZARD?"<br/><br/>Akiko says, "We noticed. :)"<br/><br/>Nhoj says, "Or the ZMP, etc?"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "The INHERIT flag will change permissions and privileges on<br/>zoned objects, just like it does on non-zoned objects."<br/>Trispis says, "Well.. I /think/ I could have retained ownership of the ZMO in<br/>this instance, but it was simpler to just put it all into mortal situation.<br/>Since that was the intention of Zones in the beginning anyway."<br/>Trispis says, "If you have a ROYALTY or WIZARD player to experiment with, I<br/>suggest doing experiments on your own with some test objects and test<br/>characters.  If you intend to have a ROY or WIZ player involved in a Zone,<br/>you'd better be far more familiar with zones than this lecture will cover."<br/><br/>Akiko grins.<br/><br/>Nhoj nods.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Um... Just for your information (to see the versatility of<br/>zones), the 101 Schoolhouse is made up of /all three/ types of zones."<br/>Trispis says, "Everything in the schoolhouse is owned by 101ZMP."<br/>Trispis says, "Which doesn't require any @chzone-ing (ownership by the ZMP<br/>creates the zone)."<br/>Trispis says, "All rooms are zoned to 101ZMR, where we keep our own set of<br/>zone globals."<br/>Trispis says, "All things and exits are zoned to the 101ZMO (thing).... so<br/>that they can also be maintained by the folks on the zone."<br/>Trispis says, "the purpose of using all three is this:..."<br/>Trispis says, "It allows us to give limited access to certain things on the<br/>zone to players who want to work on limited portions."<br/>Trispis says, "If someone wants to tinker with an exitlock, we can put them on<br/>the zonelock of the zmo and allow them the access they need without giving<br/>them access to rooms ..."<br/>Trispis says, "And vice-versa for access to rooms and not exits."<br/>Trispis says, "Being on the ZMP's zonelock is like being a wizard in this<br/>zone... it will even allow you to put yourself on zonelocks of<br/>ZoneMaster&lt;whatever&gt;'s owned by the ZMP."<br/>Trispis says, "final note on restrictions."<br/>Trispis says, "Zone privilege does not allow you to @nuke objects owned by<br/>other players on the zone."<br/>Trispis says, "If you don't own it, you can't nuke it."<br/>David says, "What if the ZMP owns it?"<br/>Trispis says, "You can change lots of flags, add/remove/edit attributes...<br/>just as if you did own it, but you can't nuke it."<br/>Trispis says, "Nuking requires that you own it."<br/>Trispis says, "If the ZMP owns it, you can't nuke it."<br/>Trispis says, "I'm pretty much through with my illustration/lecture on zones."<br/>Trispis says, "Any questions?"<br/><br/>Xira waves extatically! "Grinna!"<br/>Xira says, "yes trispis."<br/>Xira says, "look at my attribute I put on the Sample object."<br/><br/>Trispis will take questions for about 25 min.<br/><br/>NHOJ [#1906]: Cows can moo.<br/>AKIKO [#1804]: hah!<br/>XIRA [#2362]: $Xira:@emit=Oh my god look over there!<br/>DAVID [#1907]: Anything you can do, I can do better...anything I can do better<br/>then you...<br/>TEST [#1623]: test<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Okay."<br/><br/>Xira says, "what is wrong with it?"<br/><br/>THING: Sample-Object-#2779-n<br/>Owner: Joshua-#375-PenA<br/>Zone: Sample-ZMO-#2780-Vn<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Look at the flags on the sample-obj"<br/><br/>Xira says, "okay, I can set flags right?"<br/><br/>David says, "Can you put an zone thing on itself, thus letting anyone on the<br/>lock add people?"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Do: @set sample-object=!no_command"<br/>Trispis says, "Try it, Xira."<br/><br/>Xira says, "I did."<br/><br/>NHOJ [#1906]: Cows can moo.<br/>AKIKO [#1804]: hah!<br/>XIRA [#2362]: $Xira:@emit=Oh my god look over there!<br/>DAVID [#1907]: Anything you can do, I can do better...anything I can do better<br/>then you...<br/>TEST [#1623]: test<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Yes, David."<br/>Trispis says, "I've seen it done, but normally don't do it."<br/>Trispis says, "Xira: there's no equal sign (=) used in @emit"<br/><br/>FugueEdit &gt; &amp;XIRA #2779=$Xira:@emit=Oh my god look over there!<br/><br/>Sample-Object/XIRA - Set.<br/><br/>Trispis fixes.<br/><br/>Oh my god look over there!<br/><br/>Trispis grins.<br/><br/>Akiko says, "commands /on/ a ZMO are global to all rooms in the zone?"<br/><br/>Trispis may have to leave unexpectedly.<br/><br/>David test some security...<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Akiko: Yes... they're global to all rooms @chzoned to that<br/>zmo."<br/><br/>Akiko says, "But not objects inside?"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Um... Test it and see (more advanced than this lecture was<br/>intended)."<br/><br/>Akiko says, "Can you chain ZMOs?"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Yes."<br/>Trispis says, "You can zone a zmo to another zmo."<br/><br/>David says, "Hmmm...it worked..."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "the ZMO is not special. It's just a focal point for objects<br/>zoned to it."<br/>Trispis says, "It's where the server looks for permissions."<br/>Trispis says, "Note: Any given object can only be @chzone-ed to /one/ ZMO at a<br/>time. The only time an object can belong to more than one zone is when a<br/>ZMPlayer is involved. i.e., an object can be owned by a zmp and chzoned to<br/>some other ZMObject (thing or room)."<br/>Trispis has about 5-10 min left, then must leave.<br/><br/>David says, "Trispis, do you see what I'm trying to do?"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Before I go, I want to apologize again for forgetting about the<br/>ROYALTY issue. That was a silly mistake (one I've made a hundred times and<br/>never learned from)."<br/>Trispis looks, David.<br/><br/>DAVID [#1907]: $david:@set/adescribe me=!no_command<br/><br/>Oh my god look over there!<br/><br/>Xira says, "thanks"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Yes, I see. And I think that should work... if the object has<br/>an &amp;adescribe attribute."<br/>Trispis says, "but..."<br/>Trispis says, "The correct syntax is...<br/><br/>$david:@set me/adescribe=!no_command"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Um... unless the adescribe attribute is protected by the server<br/>in some way (similar to the @describe attribute, which cannot be set<br/>!no_command or !visual."<br/>Trispis says, "er... correction."<br/>Trispis says, "@describe cannot be set 'no_command' or '!visual'"<br/>Trispis says, "Wait."<br/>Trispis says, "maybe i had it right the first time."<br/><br/>Akiko grins.<br/><br/>Grinna giggles.<br/><br/>Trispis is obsessed with his pending appointment.<br/>Trispis thinks.<br/><br/>David has to go real quick...but I'll read the log...and will this work in to<br/>add people?<br/><br/>Xira scratches his head "I am lost"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Yes, I think it will, David."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "If the ZMO is zoned to itself, you should be able to add people<br/>to the zonelock."<br/><br/>Xira says, "and did you get my messed up psyco-babble @mail?"<br/><br/>Akiko says, "Well, that was invigorating."<br/><br/>Trispis didn't get any mail.<br/><br/>Sample-Object(#2779)<br/>Type: Thing Flags:<br/>Owner: Joshua  Zone: Sample-ZMO(#2780Vn)  Ducats: 1<br/>Parent: *NOTHING*<br/>Powers:<br/>Warnings checked: none<br/>Created: Sat Jul 25 15:05:41 1998<br/>Last Modification: Sat Jul 25 16:16:39 1998<br/>NHOJ [#1906]: Cows can moo.<br/>AKIKO [#1804]: hah!<br/>XIRA [#1623]: $Xira:@emit Oh my god look over there!<br/>DAVID [#1907]: $david:@set me/adescribe=!no_command<br/>TEST [#1623]: test<br/>Home: Meeting Room(#1098R)<br/>Location: Meeting Room(#1098R)<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Anyway...
