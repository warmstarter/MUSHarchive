        Date: Sun, 22 Sep 1996 21:11:58 -0400 (EDT)<br/>Subject: Effeciency class log -- Paleran<br/><br/>Paleran says, "I believe we have enough players to begin."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "First thing: Please page if you wish to speak so that the spam level <br/>      may be decreased in the room."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Welcome to the Coding School's Nth class on efficiency. Eru knows how<br/>      many of these have been done, but it is always a topic everyone enjoys <br/>      hearing about as different players have different views."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "The first topic will be on fundamentals of efficient coding."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "To start off with, the old @commands versus functions debate."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Now everyone should realize one thing: You need at least one <br/>      @command, or 'think' in order to have your command evaluated when invoked<br/>      (this goes without saying that ufun()s are an exception.)"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "But now the question is (rhetorically): What should I use after the <br/>      initial stages of the code are in place?"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Most people believe that functions are the end all be all to <br/>      efficient coding. This is not necessarily true."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Example: Try to think of how to code a +clear for a +mail system. In <br/>	this command, an edit of multiply accessed attributes is invoked to <br/>	decrement a counter that contains the number of players that contain <br/>	that message in their mailbox."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "This, of course, is one method, but in order to do this, a simple <br/>	'think functions' will not suffice as queue evaluation becomes a <br/>	serious factor."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "So, one must resort to @dolist instead of iter() for this example."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "In most cases, however, functions are the most efficient way to solve <br/>	a coding problem."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Any questions so far before I move on?"<br/><br/>Stoney says, "YEs. Why exactly do you have to use an @dolist in that situation?"<br/><br/>Paleran smiles, "I figured someone would ask that."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "It is a result of a topic I shall be covering a little later; the <br/>	queue evaluation. I will explain this in a bit, but were you to code <br/>	that command with an iter(), a situation might arise that would force <br/>	a horrible lag on the MUSH. Imagine someone deleting 100 messages. <br/>	That takes only one queue call with an iter(), but 100 with a @dolist. <br/>	I'll explain why the latter is more desirable."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Any other questions?"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Okay, moving on: The @wait &lt;gasp&gt;...Everyone hates the @wait command."<br/><br/>Stoney says, "Ah"<br/><br/>Jas says, "I do?"<br/><br/>Gruumsh loves it. :)<br/><br/>Paleran says, "HOld up a moment here, gaskin?"<br/><br/>Gruumsh puts @wait's on everything.<br/><br/>Gruumsh grins. :)<br/><br/>Gaskin says, "How much CPU time do MUSHcode functions use up, anyway? Surely <br/>	even something like the Pentium Elendor runs on should be able to cope <br/>	with anything we could throw at it?"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "In most cases, yes..."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "A simple addition or subtraction scheme takes nanoseconds for the <br/>	CPU to process, but something like an iter() can become seriously CPU <br/>	extensive were it abused; as in the +clear example I drew upon before."<br/><br/>Gruumsh steps closer to his screen, so he will see the text nanoseconds faster.<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Moving on to @waits."<br/><br/>Gaskin nods.<br/><br/>Paleran says, "There is only one instance where @waits become a serious problem: <br/>	Expansive timed waits. This may include a very large timed wait, or a <br/>	counter-type wait where an infinite loop is invoked."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "The reason this is a problem is as follows:"<br/><br/>Gruumsh raises his hand.<br/><br/>Paleran stops mid-sentence, "Gruumsh?"<br/><br/>Gruumsh says, "This morning I coded a warg with multiple @waits on its @a*'s, <br/>	making it have timed grunts and snarls for effect, so you would not <br/>	know what caused it to do that.."<br/><br/>Gruumsh says, "My max was like 6 seconds.. is this a really bad thing? :)"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "For @a* commands, not necessarily. I code those instances on objects, <br/>	myself."<br/><br/>Stoney sneaks ou tof the room while the teacher isn;t looking...<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Better, though, to have it respond to actions via ^-listen commands, <br/>	so that way you can narrow down when it gets invoked."<br/><br/>Gruumsh nods.. "Thats a good idea. :)"<br/><br/>Gruumsh writes that down in his notebook.<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Which brings me to my point I was going to express before...On a <br/>	small MUSH, using @waits is common and perfectly acceptable. As soon <br/>	as you start growing, and these @waits become more extensive, you run <br/>	into the problem of queue delay, which ultimately lags the MUSH."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Most of you may or may not have noticed, but there is always one <br/>	object that resides in the @wait queue...Anyone (besides Frodo) know <br/>	what this is?"<br/><br/>Paleran looks around, "Guess not...It's what is called a cron counter."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "A cron counter is a process that is set up to run infinitely, <br/>	triggering objects across the MUSH at certain time intervals."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "+species, +culture, bulletin board updates, mobile objects are all a <br/>	part of this cron counter."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Now, although some may argue that this is no more efficient than <br/>	having numerous @waits on the queue, I'll suffice it to say that it is <br/>	much more amiable from the administrative perspective."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Perhaps Lukthil would be able to answer this question, but he's not <br/>	here :) (I don't think)"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Moving along in series, we come to queue management. Some of you <br/>	probably do not know why there are two sets of queues for @wait <br/>	processes: semaphore and timed waits."<br/><br/>Gruumsh says, "Not a clue."<br/><br/>Gaskin says, "For getting your code to run in order?"<br/><br/>Gaskin says, "Semaphores, I mean. Though I never actually managed to work out <br/>	how. :)"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "The answer is complicated, but semaphores do allow an object to <br/>	repond to queue cycles more effectively. Example: a @wait me= in an <br/>	attribute will force an object to sit in the semaphore queue until <br/>	@notified."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Yes Gaskin, exactly."<br/><br/>Gruumsh mumbles. "Show off."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Here is how the MUSH works on a very basic level:"<br/><br/>Gruumsh eeps, and must go code. He will read the log.<br/><br/>Paleran says, "It sits, waiting for some invocation of a command to pass the parser.<br/>	 As soon as the parser sees this, it examines the source of the <br/>	invocation and the type of command. If it is a basic MUSH command, <br/>	such as WHO or PAGE, it will evaluate immediately from this MUSH queue. <br/>	If it is a user-defined command (+com, +who, any commands on<br/>	yourself), it is placed into the player/object queue. If it is a <br/>	@wait/semaphore, it is shoved into those respective queues. Now, when <br/>	the MUSH queue cycles through and completes its actions, it retrieves <br/>	the first queued item on the player queue and object queue, and <br/>	evaluates it."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "@wait/semaphores are weird. I'm not sure exactly how they are <br/>	parsed, aside from the knowledge that it is a separate process from <br/>	the MUSH queue, and a clock checks to make sure what needs to be <br/>	evaluated."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Now, to reiterate Gaskin's point, since the MUSH evaluates things at <br/>	different speeds, a command that was called 5 seconds before a simple <br/>	command might not finish evaluation until after it. Which leads to <br/>	serious problems in many cases."<br/><br/>Paleran phews, "Any questions? :)"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "OKay, moving on once again: function usage."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "ufuns() are everyone's favorite function, well most players at least :)"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Reason: not only does it cut down on code length making code easier <br/>	to read (we all know how horrid that is), it not only speeds up <br/>	evaluation, but also allows for multiple uses of this function from <br/>	different commands"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Can anyone give an example of where a ufun would be more desirable?"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Anyone awake? ;)"<br/><br/>Gaskin is, but doesn't understand the question. :)<br/><br/>Guareth has never coded on a MUSH before, he just has nowhere to be right now ;)<br/><br/>Mara nods and thinks if gaskin doesn't understand it she definately won't<br/><br/>Searonett is, but has never used the ufun. "Haven't coded since last year. got <br/>	burnout." :)<br/><br/>Guareth says, "Oh ufun... I've used something like that on a MUSE."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Okay... How about this: Which is better: <br/>	switch(u(test),cases,u(actions based on cases)) or <br/>	switch(example,cases,actions for each case) when coding something like <br/>	a +who/switch command?"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Think about this carefully :)"<br/><br/>Gaskin hmmms. "The second? But it'd be spammier." :)<br/><br/>Paleran says, "To whom?"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "the player, of course :) But not to the MUSH."<br/><br/>Gaskin nods, "Whoever is ex'ing the object..."<br/><br/>Gaskin says, "Well, it'd be harder to update, then? Or slightly slower. :)"<br/><br/>Gaskin says, "No, slightly faster!"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "In a +who/switch, you need to evaluate different levels of output <br/>	based on the given switch. A PERSONAL switch needs to check the <br/>	executor's LIST_PERSONAL (or whatever it is) for dbrefs, or a LOCATION <br/>	switch needs to check the location of the given input"<br/>&gt; It may be pointed out here that usually it is better coding style to<br/>&gt; separate the switches into multiple commands<br/><br/>Gaskin gives up.<br/><br/>Paleran is coming to it, Gaskin :)<br/><br/>Gaskin sorries.<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Now first, the second method of checking each input and basing <br/>	actions on that input (switch = input) requires a simple check of the <br/>	argument, then parsing the correct case based on the argument. The <br/>	delay that comes from doing this can be minimal, or numerous."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Let's say that a +who command takes four lines of code to create. <br/>	Now for each case, you'd have to repeat that same command (or series <br/>	of functions) and parse the output based on the switch (filtering, in <br/>	other words)."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Now, you can either repeat these four lines of code for EACH SWITCH, <br/>	or! You may use a ufun() to cut down on this"<br/><br/>Paleran hopes everyone is a little clearer on this. I don't want to dwell too <br/>	long on this topic :)<br/><br/>Paleran will reserve further discussion of this for another class. Moving on<br/><br/>Paleran says, "The xget() versus get() debate."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Anyone have any thoughts as to which is faster?"<br/><br/>Paleran sees the class has withered greatly.<br/><br/>Frodo raises his hand, "xget is alleged to be faster, but my guess is that the <br/>	difference is trivial"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Not so much trivial, but based on what exactly you are doing with <br/>	it. The answer is, it's complicated :)"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Simple put, though:"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "xget() is faster than get if you need to evaluate both arguments, <br/>	whereas get is faster if the second argument requires NO evaluation."<br/><br/>Gaskin writes that one down. :)<br/><br/>Paleran can get into a long-winded discussion as to why, but I'll spare you <br/>	guys :)<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Another example: iter() versus map()"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Which one is faster? :)"<br/><br/>Frodo thinks that iter() would be faster, since it doesn't have to go and <br/>	dereference the function, since it is inline.<br/><br/>Gaskin says, "Map()=Ufun() for lists? :)"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Usually, yes. But there is one isolated case that map() is faster"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Where the first argument of the iterative function requires a <br/>	retrieval of an attribute."<br/><br/>Frodo nods.<br/>Paleran says, "Example: iter(get(#10000/shire_list),stuff) is slower than <br/>	map(#10000/shire_list,stuff)"<br/>&gt; Azahkil pointed out to me later that this wasn't the best example, I'll keep <br/>&gt; those pages in the log<br/><br/>Paleran says, "filter, fold, and numerous others need to be examined thoroughly if <br/>	you're striving for the most efficient coding possible."<br/><br/>Paleran will skip right along to...<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Efficient coding: how necessary is it?"<br/><br/>Azakhil has never seen map used like that...I thought the first arg was the <br/>	function and the 2nd the list<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Yup, you're right :)"<br/><br/>Paleran got the arguments flipped, sorry.<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Back to the efficient coding question, the answer is, it really <br/>	doesn't for 95% of all player's code."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Reason being:"<br/><br/>Frodo suspects that the limiting factor in lag is usually things like checking <br/>	permissions on zones and things, along with net lag, and that <br/>	squeezing a few cycles here and there doesn't make much difference.<br/><br/>Paleran says, "The sole 5% are the global functions on a MUSH, the ones that are <br/>	invoked on a daily basis by numerous players."<br/><br/>Frodo nods. "The globals need to be efficiently coded. That's where the <br/>	machine spends its time."<br/><br/>Paleran nods, "Pretty much, Frodo. It's a case-by-case scenario."<br/><br/>Frodo says, "A lot of functions only get executed once a month... no point <br/>	worrying about time there."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Right, whereas the local objects that makes up the 95% of the MUSH, <br/>	such as guards, books, etc., are really incosequential to the <br/>	effeciency of the MUSH."<br/><br/>Gaskin mumbles, "Hacker mentality."<br/><br/>Azakhil pages: not to interrupt your class further, but with map() to get the <br/>	list, you still need a get....ie:<br/>	map(function,get(oject/list))<br/>	if Function is on the object calling map()<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Although...It is generally appreciated to code as efficiently as to <br/>	the limits of your abilities :) As soon as you start worrying about <br/>	whether xget or get is more efficient, you need to re-evaluate exactly <br/>	how much this command will be invoked and if this is actually<br/>	worth the trouble :)"<br/><br/>Paleran pages Azakhil with 'It was a bad example, yeah.'.<br/><br/>Paleran pages Azakhil with 'It's not usually something I worry about<br/>	too much, but was the best I could come up with on the fly :)'.<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Note that global code also encompasses ZMO coding. Not invoked<br/>	nearly as much as the commands in the Master Room, but should be coded<br/>	semi-efficiently as they will be executed more than local commands."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "One last point before I open the floor: external coding."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Were you able to see the entire MUSH, you would notice a large<br/>	number of players with OOC code, com macros, etc. (well, maybe not<br/> 	so much now as before). These things are much more amiably placed<br/>	on external programs such as tf where you may execute them<br/>	locally, instead of making the MUSH do the work."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Personally, I have 2436 bytes on my object character. Probably<br/> 	one of the lowest in the game due to one fact: Most of my<br/> 	macros/code is placed into tf, where the MUSH-tf interaction is<br/>	much faster than completely via the MUSH."<br/><br/>&gt;From afar, Azakhil nods, "I'm not ripping on you, your doing fine, I<br/> 	agree with most or your examples..just thought I'd point it<br/> 	out....what you mentioned was true in speed if the function, is on<br/>	the same object....and if it is a v() list...I think...<br/><br/>Long distance to Azakhil: Paleran nods, "That is the case I had thought<br/>	about before...Not sure why I used #10000 exactly :)<br/><br/>Frodo nods. "TF is also good for storing wardrobes and stuff off line."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Well, that's all I have to say for this session. Any questions<br/>	on any point I have covered?"<br/><br/>Across Middle-earth, Eonwe shouts, "+wardrobe is offline while I work on it."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Weird :)"<br/>&gt; Although unrelated to the class, I kept that there because it was cool:)<br/><br/>Samwise only takes up 2190..:P<br/><br/>Paleran nods, "Yeah, I do have a /ic and /ooc macro where my description<br/>	gets updated based on my WHO status.<br/><br/>Paleran says, "You don't need a &amp;HISTORY, sammy :)"<br/><br/>Samwise grins.<br/><br/>Gaskin grins.<br/><br/>Gaskin says, "I've got a few questions..."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Shoot :)"<br/><br/>Paleran quickly hides behind Frodo as a guard.<br/><br/>Gaskin says, "Though perhaps not related to your points. :) First, is<br/> 	working with a large object slower than working with a small one?<br/> 	ie. is getting attributes from a 2k object faster than from a 20k<br/>	one?"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Minimally, yes."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Were you to say 7 meg as opposed to 2k, I would say most<br/>	definately :)"<br/><br/>Frodo says, "I believe there are clever hashing functions in the way that<br/>	attributes are stored and located."<br/><br/>Paleran nods, "hashing is the fastest attribute retrieval method, I<br/>	believe, for these objects."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "The Mail database takes a serious amount of time for the parser<br/>	to extract the attribute it needs, whereas an object such as a<br/>	palyer character as myself takes fractions of a second."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "And we're talking in small increments here :) milliseconds as<br/>	opposed to nano or picoseconds. Not something altogether<br/>	noticeable isolated, but compounded can be quite harsh on the MUSH<br/>	process altogether."<br/><br/>Gaskin OKs, "Another question- do the length of attribute names make any<br/>	difference at all to the MUSH? Is getting<br/>	#19499/GASKIN_MADE_THIS_ATTRIBUTE faster than #19499/GMTA?"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Does that answer your question, Gaskin? It's not something to<br/>	worry about :)"<br/><br/>Frodo has to run and will catch Gaskin's questions in the log. "Thanks,<br/>	Paleran!"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Thank you, Frodo :)"<br/><br/>Gaskin was just wondering. These are the questions he never got to ask<br/>	before. :p<br/><br/>Frodo says, "Lukthil once told me that attribute names don't make any<br/>	significant difference."<br/><br/>Frodo leaves the classroom.<br/><br/>Paleran says, "They don't for this reason:"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Attribute names are checked character by character. As soon as<br/> 	it finds a perfect match and has no unresolved conflicts, it will<br/>	return the value of the attribute."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Were you to have a number of attributes like<br/> 	#19499/GASKIN_MADE_THIS_ATTRIBUTE1 then 2, then 3, etc...that<br/> 	*might* have a small impact, but isolated nothing to be concerned<br/>	about."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Also, I think there is a limit as to the attribute name's<br/>	length. Not too sure, though. Something to find out :)"<br/><br/>Paleran eeps as his guard is gone, "Well, shoot em off if you got em, Gaskin :)"<br/><br/>Gaskin grins. "While I'm on a roll, what's the maximum length an<br/>	attribute can be?"<br/><br/>Paleran bzzzt, "Already answered. Next question :)"<br/><br/>Gaskin says, "Is was? Curses. :)"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Also, I think there is a limit as to the attribute name's<br/>	length. Not too sure, though. Something to find out :)"<br/><br/>Baria leaves the classroom.<br/><br/>Celwe has a question that has nothing to do with the topic. :) "Where can<br/>	I find a good coding FAQ besides Amberyl's?"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "There's one somewhere on the Web that I found the other day.<br/>	Derned if I knew the URL, however."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Do a search in altavista for 'MUSH code' :)"<br/><br/>Samwise has a question related to that, "Is there a place to learn about<br/>	hardcoding?"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "No, there isn't Samwise."<br/><br/>Gaskin buys C++ for Dummies.<br/><br/>Paleran says, "In order to hardcode you have to be one of the following:<br/> 	extremely adaptive to noticing patterns and creating extensions to<br/> 	those patterns, or extremely knowledgable in C and UNIX coding. Or<br/>	any intermix between the two :)"<br/><br/>Samwise ohs, "Darn."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "MUSHcode is in straight C, not C++ :)"<br/><br/>Gaskin buys C for Dummies.<br/><br/>Samwise says, "Well, I just need to learn UNIX and C, I guess..&lt;sigh&gt;"<br/><br/>Gaskin raises his hand, and actually meant the maximum size of attribute<br/>	*contents* back there. :p<br/><br/>Paleran says, "For example, Belegril/Xatra knows absolutely nothing about C,<br/> 	yet he created a series of functional equivalents to @wait and<br/> 	@force. Not altogether too hard if you're an excellent problem<br/>	solver. Then myself, I learned C first so it was slightly<br/>	easier for me to hardcode more original functions."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Contents! Oh :)"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "4K, I believe..."<br/><br/>Gaskin ahs.<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Or it might be 8K on Elendor. Not sure what Lukthil modified it<br/>	to. I know for a fact that it is 4K by default :)"<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Any other questions? Gaskin or anyone?"<br/><br/>Samwise shakes his head, "Nope. Good class..:)"<br/><br/>Gaskin agrees, "Time for a quick code spring cleaning..."<br/><br/>Paleran says, "Okay, well I thank you all that stuck my boring lecture out<br/>	until the end, and happy coding :)"<br/><br/>Samwise waves<br/><br/>
