        Thursday Nights, 1 Yes, it's time again for a TIM Coding Workshop, this time part of the "MasterTrack" series (you know coding and want to really nail it down) on Attribute Aliases and Functions. Come on in, just sit in the back if you want, or dive in with the fun. Tonight's Lecturer: Sketch. Beginner courses will continue to be held on Thursday evenings.<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Abe Vigoda Memorial Lecture Hall<br/><br/>The campus' main lecture hall is wide and spacious, with rows of uncomfortable seats inclining downward towards the wooden podium. Whiteboards, covered with indecipherable scribbles, line the back wall, and a globe (globe?) of TIM rests to the podium's right. Pieces of paper and empty drink cups litter the floor beneath the seats.<br/><br/>Reo has arrived.<br/><br/>Reo says "Anyway."<br/><br/>Reo says "JE suis bien."<br/><br/>Arki has arrived.<br/><br/>Arki has left.<br/><br/>Br'fin carefully scoops up Arki and puts her on his shoulder, where she trills softly.<br/><br/>Br'fin takes out Arki.<br/><br/>Br'fin says "mmmf, need to dust off my puppet controller"<br/><br/>Coal has arrived.<br/><br/>Coal waves.<br/><br/>Br'fin says "Heya Coal."<br/><br/>Gondwana has arrived.<br/><br/>Reo dropped Gondwana.<br/><br/>Sydney says "Do y'all have lizards?"<br/><br/>Reo says "I do."<br/><br/>From Br'fin's shoulder, Inkwell cheeps<br/><br/>Reo grabs Gondwana.<br/><br/>Sydney says "Nice name."<br/><br/>cylver, wearing a lizard moustace, says, "Got Lizards?"<br/><br/>Br'fin says "I've a couple, an an archaeopteryx and probably a few other puppets about somewhere, not lizards though."<br/><br/>Br'fin scritches Arki who churrs brightly.<br/><br/>From Reo's shoulder, Gondwana trills happily.<br/><br/>Kahlua has arrived.<br/><br/>Coal waves to Kahlua.<br/><br/>Kahlua says "Woohoo"<br/><br/>Br'fin says "Hey Kahlua"<br/><br/>Kahlua says "Hewwo Coal, Br'fin"<br/><br/>Coal saved you a seat.<br/><br/>Kahlua says "Why, thanks! Please remove that landmine, and I'll be all set"<br/><br/>Sketch shouts "Mooooooo."<br/><br/>Coal puts down some tacks instead.<br/><br/>Reo secretly puts a tack on Sketch's chair.<br/><br/>Squeaky says "Mu"<br/><br/>Storm has arrived.<br/><br/>Coal monobrains with Reo. Kinda.<br/><br/>Coal says "Hi Storm."<br/><br/>Natalie has arrived.<br/><br/>Storm says "Hiya Coal."<br/><br/>Kahlua says "You're so kind, all of you."<br/><br/>Coal says "Hey Natalie."<br/><br/>Natalie waves around.<br/><br/>Sketch shouts "The TinyTIM Coding Workshop series continues today with the premiere of the MasterBuilder Fast Track, focusing on Attribute Aliases and Functions. Hey ho, you must go."<br/><br/>Reo says "monobrain, divictim."<br/><br/>Sketch shouts "To get there, go 18, N, N, ABE from the Nexus."<br/><br/>Patrick has arrived.<br/><br/>Sketch shouts "The beginner's coding workshop continues on Thursday."<br/><br/>Coal says "Or take the bus.

"Could you set the @functions on a parent object, and then set your @functions to it?"<br/><br/>Sketch says "Forgot the parenthesis, Squeaky."<br/><br/>Squeaky says "Uh Huh :)"<br/><br/>Sketch says "I believe so."<br/><br/>Reo says "And recursively use the functions on the parent object's @functions, Coal?"<br/><br/>Sketch hands out a few other weird functions on those.

"I love those wacky things."<br/><br/>Squeaky says "In a system of full capitalism, there should be a complete separation of state and economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as state and church."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Both those functions were created for planes I've done on TIM, but I have them around to share."<br/><br/>Coal got a list of objects with interesting functions on them from someone ages ago (might have been Territan).

A count of how many v's you've been passed?"<br/><br/>Sketch says "No."<br/><br/>Sketch says "That's actually a cool idea to bring to R'nice."<br/><br/>Coal says "There's a limit to the number of arguments, though, right? 0-9?"<br/><br/>Reo says "What the hell is Daron saying?"<br/><br/>Daron says "Ok, and the parser will give an error if you pass 2 things and try to access v(3) right?"<br/><br/>Sketch has to go test now.<br/><br/>Daron says "test?"<br/><br/>Coal says "I think it gives you a zero/null value, Daron. It does in TinyMUSH."<br/><br/>Daron says "Is the class over?"<br/><br/>Kylene wasn't told there'd be a test!<br/><br/>cylver says "Reo: It's C stuff. Don't worry about it."<br/><br/>Natalie hopes it's open-help.<br/><br/>Sketch says "No, in fact, it can be V(0) through V(39)!"<br/><br/>Br'fin says "What other questions do folks have?"<br/><br/>Coal says "Really?"<br/><br/>Sketch must have thrown something at R'nice some time.<br/><br/>Kahlua says "That's a lotta arguments."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Class isn't over."<br/><br/>Coal says "Why to 39?"<br/><br/>Reo sues Daron for taking his vauable classroom hours up. :)<br/><br/>Daron says "Ah, good."<br/><br/>Sketch is going to attack one or two more functions for you to grok.<br/><br/>Daron's that keener at the front.<br/><br/>cylver says "Because 40 is a nice round number."<br/><br/>Natalie says "It rained for 40 days and nights, so it follows that.."<br/><br/>Natalie ducks.<br/><br/>Br'fin quacks()?<br/><br/>Sketch says "Let's go after one I love. UAPPEND."<br/><br/>Sketch says "EXAMINE #69/UAPPEND."<br/><br/>Sketch says "The MATCH function returns a 1 if the two arguments match, and a 0 if they don't."<br/><br/>Sketch says "For example, SAY MATCH(Bob Saget,Bob Saget)"<br/><br/>Sketch says "Or SAY MATCH(Marcia,Sketch)"<br/><br/>Squeaky says "0"<br/><br/>Reo says "0"<br/><br/>Natalie says "0"<br/><br/>Squeaky says "0"<br/><br/>Reo says "0"<br/><br/>Natalie says "1"<br/><br/>Reo says "I got a 0 on the Bob Sagets..."<br/><br/>Squeaky says "0"<br/><br/>Reo says "0"<br/><br/>Squeaky says "I get 'o' on Marcia, Sketch"<br/><br/>Natalie says "0"<br/><br/>Sketch says "Oops."<br/><br/>Sketch says "It checks the NUMBERs."<br/><br/>Sketch sometimes gets these mixed up. Even me!<br/><br/>Kahlua says "How does it work, then?"<br/><br/>Squeaky says "0"<br/><br/>Sketch says "The CONCAT function, given two arguments, returns those arguments with a space between tem."<br/><br/>Squeaky says "1"<br/><br/>Sketch says "The MATCH function, given two numbers, returns a 1 if those numbers are the same, and a 0 if they aren't.,"<br/><br/>Kahlua says "Oh. OK. Just numbers."<br/><br/>Reo says "1"<br/><br/>Sketch says "In fact, we're going to OPTIMIZE UAPPEND tonight."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Because since UAPPEND was first written, a new function made an appearance."<br/><br/>Sketch says "But first, let's just break it apart."<br/><br/>cylver says "If() comes to mind."<br/><br/>Sketch says "There you go."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Egad, I'm so off."<br/><br/>Coal says "eq() also comes to mind."<br/><br/>Sketch is confusing MATCH with EQ.<br/><br/>Sketch &amp;lr;---- Dunce.<br/><br/>Sketch says "Let's try again."<br/><br/>Daron says "match returns the index of v(1) in v(0)"<br/><br/>Sketch says "The MATCH function, given a string, and a word, tells you if the word is in String."<br/><br/>Sketch says "If there is no such match, it returns a 0."<br/><br/>Sketch says "So, let's look at switch(match(v(0),v(1)),0,concat(v(0),v(a)),v(0))."<br/><br/>Coal says "So UAPPEND compares a word to a list of words and if the word is not there, it tacks it on the end of the list?"<br/><br/>Reo says "aha."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Yes."<br/><br/>Daron nods.<br/><br/>Kahlua says "Uh, Sketch?"<br/><br/>Sydney lightbulbs!<br/><br/>Sketch typed v(a) by mistake.<br/><br/>Coal says "And if it is there, it just returns the list."<br/><br/>Kahlua says "Match appears to return the POSITION in the string of the word that matches"<br/><br/>Reo says "My granny wears really torn panties "<br/><br/>Sydney sees an application for UAPPEND.<br/><br/>Sketch says "Yes, I just said that, Kahlua."<br/><br/>Daron says "and 0 if nothing, Kahlua."<br/><br/>Reo says "My granny panties wears really torn"<br/><br/>Reo says "Neat."<br/><br/>Sketch says "How are we doing with people?"<br/><br/>Kahlua says "I didn't see where you said that. Sorry."<br/><br/>Kylene would like to see an example or two.<br/><br/>Sydney nods.<br/><br/>Coal says "So SWITCH() could easily be replaced with IF() since we're looking for a zero/not zero response here, right?"<br/><br/>Sketch says "Right."<br/><br/>Sketch says "You could theoretically make UAPPEND to be IF(match(v(0),v(1)),v(0),concat(v(0),v(1)) and it would work the same."<br/><br/>Sketch says "This would gain you a few characters."<br/><br/>Popsnuh has arrived.<br/><br/>Biff the Wonder Parrot has arrived.<br/><br/>Biff the Wonder Parrot perches happily on Kahlua's shoulder.<br/><br/>Biff the Wonder Parrot whips out a handful of chicken-fried mealworms and munches them down.<br/><br/>Sketch says "The UAPPEND command, in that case, would say IF you can find the NEW WORD (v(1)) in the OLD GROUP OF WORDS (v(0)), return just the OLD GROUP OF WORDS. Otherwise, return the OLD GROUP OF WORDS COMBINED (concat) with the NEW WORD."<br/><br/>Sketch wants to whip the lectures into summaries at some point, anyway.<br/><br/>Daron volunteers?<br/><br/>Sketch says "Does this explanation make sense to anyone? Whisper or page if not."<br/><br/>Coal whips Daron.<br/><br/>Sydney gets it astonishingly clearly now.<br/><br/>Daron laughs between ouches.<br/><br/>Sydney's brain makes a loud "click" sound.<br/><br/>Kylene says "I see how it works... I'm still trying to figure out why it works, but I'll get that later."<br/><br/>Daron says "Uhoh, Sydney's loaded."<br/><br/>Kahlua squirts some oil into Sydney's ears<br/><br/>Reo says "uappend(All around the mulberry, bush) results:"<br/><br/>Reo says "All around the mulberry bush "<br/><br/>Reo says "But uappend(All around the bush mulberry, bush) results:"<br/><br/>Reo says "All around the bush mulberry"<br/><br/>Sydney has a thing which keeps track of folks who speak French on TIM. This would be a great thing to use with that.<br/><br/>Squeaky says "All around the bush raspberry"<br/><br/>Kylene speaks French, Sydney, for the record. :)<br/><br/>Sketch says "The UAPPEND function would enable you to just keep adding folks without worrying about doubles. This is actually how that box I drop in the Nexus that people add ideas to works."<br/><br/>Daron understands more than he thinks.<br/><br/>Popsnuh says "OK. How do you stop uappend from maxing out one of the Va, Vb functions, then?"<br/><br/>Sketch says "You don't."<br/><br/>Sketch says "You have to keep an eye on it, like I do. Attributes max out at around 10k."<br/><br/>Coal says "How large can they get without maxing out?"<br/><br/>Popsnuh says "Well, when the box gets flooded, it must blow away what's being stored there due to size limits, no?"<br/><br/>Coal says "Ah. Never mind."<br/><br/>Sketch says "No, it just stops adding them."<br/><br/>Sydney says "Hopefully a list of names wouldn't max out. Not a list of French-speakers, anyhow."<br/><br/>Sketch then copies off the attribute, and then clears the original.<br/><br/>Daron understands more than he SPEAKS, he meant.<br/><br/>Sketch says "OK, let's now go after my all time favorite for this sort of work, the one that makes people shrink in fear."<br/><br/>Sketch says "The ITH function."<br/><br/>Daron says "Sketch when you clear out the original and then start a new one, to you change the use of uappend to concat() the two?"<br/><br/>Sketch says "First, let's hit you up with it so you get slammed by code, so that way you're even more impressed with you learn it."<br/><br/>cylver says "Couldn't you use a combination of @trigger, @wait and words() to warn you if it was getting close to being full?"<br/><br/>Squeaky says "#69/ITH943)"<br/><br/>Squeaky says "Argh"<br/><br/>Squeaky says "43rd"<br/><br/>Sketch says "No, Daron, I don't.

By coyote."<br/><br/>Kahlua hands Coal the pins<br/><br/>Sketch says "Given two arguments, it returns them combined with NO spaces, unlike CONCAT."<br/><br/>Sketch says "This becomes important when you realize what ith does."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Ith puts the right letters at the end of a number, like 1st, 2nd, 2034th, etc."<br/><br/>Sketch says "First of all, I needed to figure out the formula for that."<br/><br/>cylver groks.<br/><br/>Sketch says "The numbers 1, 2, 3 and special cases."<br/><br/>Sketch says "1 gets st, 2 gets nd, and 3 gets rd. Everything else gets th."<br/><br/>Sketch says "EXCEPT, of course, for anything ending in 11, 12, and 13, which all end in th."<br/><br/>Reo says "all numbers that end in them, right?"<br/><br/>Sketch says "So you CAN'T just say "Everything ending in 1 is a "st"."<br/><br/>Reo says "Oh. Whoops."<br/><br/>cylver says "Nope. 11,12, and 13 don't."<br/><br/>Reo nods.<br/><br/>Sketch says "Or, you get 11st."<br/><br/>Kahlua says "12rd"<br/><br/>Kahlua says "13nd"<br/><br/>Reo says "Backwards, but yes Kahlua."<br/><br/>Kahlua says "hee hee"<br/><br/>Kahlua says "I like them that way"<br/><br/>Sketch says "Or you get something like 23413rd. But in face you WOULD get 2341st."<br/><br/>Coal says "Eleventeenth."<br/><br/>Popsnuh says "Sevenst."<br/><br/>Kahlua says "Fourteenrd"<br/><br/>Sketch says "So, let's then figure out the formua."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Formula."<br/><br/>Marcia dives head first into a vat of chocolate.<br/><br/>Marcia has left.<br/><br/>Sketch says "If the last number is 1, 2, or 3, put st, nd, or rd at the end.

Otherwise, give it th."<br/><br/>Sketch says "th."<br/><br/>Coal is an echo of Sketch.<br/><br/>Sketch moos.<br/><br/>Coolman has arrived.<br/><br/>Sketch is making more mistakes tonight. Geez. Must be the boxers.<br/><br/>Popsnuh says "!!"<br/><br/>Sketch is wearing the error boxers.<br/><br/>Br'fin giggles<br/><br/>Coal makes a mental note to wash Sketch's boxers.<br/><br/>Sketch says "MUST REMOVE ERROR."<br/><br/>Coal says "Hot water this time!"<br/><br/>Coal says "Extra soap!"<br/><br/>Sketch says "Anyway. So let's see how that massive-ass function holds up."<br/><br/>Kylene says "Aieee!"<br/><br/>Reo says "Get the sysadmin out there."<br/><br/>Sketch says "switch(mid(v(0),sub(strlen(v(0)),2),2),11,cat(v(0),th),12,cat(v(0),th),13,cat(v(0),th),switch(mid(v(0),sub(strlen(v(0)),1),1),1,cat(v(0),st),2,cat(v(0),nd),3,cat(v(0),rd),cat(v(0),th)))"<br/><br/>Sketch says "Let's review the functions it uses."<br/><br/>Coolman sits down, and ponders what is going on.<br/><br/>Sketch says "SWITCH makes a choice based on what the argument is. For example, SAY SWITCH(1,1,ONE,2,TWO,3,THREE,FOUR)"<br/><br/>cylver says "MID takes letters from a string, strlen returns the length of a string."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Which returns "ONE", because the first argument matched 1, and it returned the string afterwards."<br/><br/>Reo says "Hey, you can also use ith to talk like a midievalan."<br/><br/>Reo says "fudgeth"<br/><br/>Sydney baps Reo.<br/><br/>Sketch says "Everyone here understand SWITCH?"<br/><br/>Kahlua says "Not a but"<br/><br/>Kahlua says "Bit"<br/><br/>Br'fin does<br/><br/>Kahlua says "Seriously"<br/><br/>Squeaky says "A tad."<br/><br/>Kylene says "I thought I did, but that looks a bit different."<br/><br/>Kahlua says "I have no idea why that returned ONE"<br/><br/>Sketch says "SWITCH is one of those functions that's very important, so let's go over it."<br/><br/>Br'fin thinks fondly of switches he has known before.<br/><br/>Coolman does not, but walked in late.<br/><br/>Sketch says "Let's Try it with examples."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Let's lay it out this way: SWITCH(STRING,MATCH1,RESULT1,MATCH2,RESULT2,MATCH3,RESULT3)"<br/><br/>Sketch says "If STRING matches MATCH1, return RESULT1."<br/><br/>Kylene says "Got it."<br/><br/>Sketch says "This is important, even if it matches MATCH2 or MATCH3, it just returns the FIRST time it matched, MATCH1."<br/><br/>cylver says "It's an elegant way of doing nested IFs."<br/><br/>Kahlua says "Ah! I get it!"<br/><br/>Sketch says "Actually IFs were a way of doing simple SWITCHes."<br/><br/>Reo says "So optimally the STRING would be somthing different every time, in order to check multiple things against the same list."<br/><br/>Daron says "nested ifs'll get a different response, cylver."<br/><br/>Sketch says "IF came long after SWITCH."<br/><br/>Daron says "nested ifs could have multiple matches that'd work. switch can't."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Right, Reo."<br/><br/>Daron says "which is why switch was used in uappend."<br/><br/>Coal says "Or, Reo, you could have something that narrows down a choice. X might match both MATCH1 and MATCH2, but Y only matches MATCH2."<br/><br/>Coolman says "Too confusing for me, I'll catch the log later. Bye for now everyone!"<br/><br/>Farward says "Nested ifs would not do that, Daron. A series of un-nested ones would, though."<br/><br/>Daron says "They would, Farward."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Are we all better on SWITCH()? Remember, there's a command, @SWITCH, which is VERY similar in nature."<br/><br/>Reo doesn't get what you mean, Coal.<br/><br/>Natalie gets it!<br/><br/>Reo says "I get it."<br/><br/>Natalie says "/world trippy"<br/><br/>Coolman has left.<br/><br/>Natalie says "Ack."<br/><br/>Coal will page you, Reo.<br/><br/>Sketch gets Natalie's hint!<br/><br/>Kahlua says "Heh. Now we see who's paying attention."<br/><br/>Sydney says "Wait a minute. There's @switch and switch()?"<br/><br/>Sydney boggles.<br/><br/>Sketch says "Sure."<br/><br/>Sydney says "Why?"<br/><br/>Natalie laughs!<br/><br/>Natalie says "It was no hint. Honest!"<br/><br/>cylver says "@switch will do commands."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Because Functions and Switches do different things."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Functions are for manipulating strings."<br/><br/>Sketch says "The @SWITCH command is for doing a command."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Example:"<br/><br/>Natalie IS paying attention, btw. She learns better in paragraphs.<br/><br/>Sketch says "A good Sketch example, actually."<br/><br/>Sketch says "@LISTEN ME = * has arrived."<br/><br/>Sydney has used @switch like that.<br/><br/>Sydney says "On my greeter."<br/><br/>Sydney says "It greets me differently than anyone else."<br/><br/>Sketch says "@AHEAR ME = @SWITCH GET2(V(0),sex)=*F*,say Hello.

Have 0 (or 1) be the string so that the first 0 (or 1) result determines what RESULT you get."<br/><br/>Sketch says "That gets into how TIM evaluates functions, far beyond today."<br/><br/>Sketch says "But yes, that does work."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Back to ITH!"<br/><br/>Sketch says "switch(mid(v(0),sub(strlen(v(0)),2),2),11,cat(v(0),th),12,cat(v(0),th),13,cat(v(0),th),switch(mid(v(0),sub(strlen(v(0)),1),1),1,cat(v(0),st),2,cat(v(0),nd),3,cat(v(0),rd),cat(v(0),th)))"<br/><br/>Sketch says "STRLEN, as said, returns the LENGTH of a string.

Gotta get rid of the rivals, you know.<br/><br/>Daron nods, "I was wondering if there was an argc for functions, R'nice."<br/><br/>R'nice says "Should I ask what pretty printer is?"<br/><br/>Sketch says "Pretty printed used to split up functions based on switches."<br/><br/>Sketch says "But I'll get that working some other day."<br/><br/>Kahlua says "Coal, if you want the job transcribing nicely formatted functions out to all of us, I'm SURE you can have it"<br/><br/>Sketch says "So, I'll do it by hand."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Let's take ITH:"<br/><br/>Sketch says "switch(mid(v(0),sub(strlen(v(0)),2),2),11,cat(v(0),th),12,cat(v(0),th),13,cat(v(0),th),switch(mid(v(0),sub(strlen(v(0)),1),1),1,cat(v(0),st),2,cat(v(0),nd),3,cat(v(0),rd),cat(v(0),th)))"<br/><br/>Sketch says "And give it english instead."<br/><br/>R'nice nods.<br/><br/>Sketch says "If the(last two letters of the argument) are.... 11, then add "th", 12, add "th", or 13, add "th". OTHERWISE, if the last character is 1, add "st", 2, add "nd", or 3, add "rd". Otherwise, add th."<br/><br/>Sketch says "As farward pointed out, there's ways to compress this code, but this is how ith() functions for the moment."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Note that in SWITCH, the last lone argument says "If nothing matched, then put this.""<br/><br/>Popsnuh says "Oh. Oh. Cool."<br/><br/>Sketch says "So for example, feeding an "x" to SWITCH(v(0),A,BOB,C,JIM,D,AL,FRANK) will return FRANK because FRANK is the last argument, and matches whatever didn't match anything before (A, C, or D)."<br/><br/>Kahlua says "The proverbial SWITCH Booby-prize, as the help file says"<br/><br/>Sketch says "To review, if V(0) were C, it would return JIM, just so you can be sure you're still following."<br/><br/>Coal says "AKA the default."<br/><br/>Daron goes home.<br/><br/>Daron says "froopie!" and boots his jammie self outta here.<br/><br/>Daron has left.<br/><br/>Sketch says "So what you see up there in ITH is basically a few levels of checking against a number. Taken apart, it's pretty straightforward."<br/><br/>Sketch says "You're piecing together smaller functions to make a large, specialized one.

TOC."<br/><br/>Sketch says "EXAMINE #69/TOC."<br/><br/>Reo says "I'll just look at the object in this room if you don't mind :)"<br/><br/>Sketch says "Now, the FIRST thing to do is to make it clear that TOC has SEVERAL arguments it gets fed, and some of them are optional."<br/><br/>Sketch says "That's why you see two switch functions in there."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Additionally, this function has a number of customized functions from elsewhere."<br/><br/>Sketch says "But let's see what it does."<br/><br/>R'nice says "No, there's nothing argc like, I'm afraid. It could probably be added, if there was a demand for it. Right now, you just have to keep processing args until you hit one that's nothing."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Type This: TOC(Bob,Mark)"<br/><br/>Sketch says "SOrry, SAY TOC(Bob,Mark)"<br/><br/>Kahlua says "Oooh!"<br/><br/>Kylene says "bob........................................................................mark"<br/><br/>Squeaky says "Bob........................................................................Mark"<br/><br/>Br'fin says "Or just pass in the number of args you expect and process lists as space seperated things"<br/><br/>Sketch says "So V(0) is the text on the left, V(1) is the text on the right."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Can someone guess what V(2) does in that function?:"<br/><br/>Kahlua says "Puts in the ellipses?"<br/><br/>Farward says "It checks to see if you put in three arguments instead of two?"<br/><br/>Sketch says "But the elipses are in regardless of if there's a third argument."<br/><br/>Coal says "v(2) is ... or some other character instead."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Correct."<br/><br/>Sketch says "The V(2) is checked.

Whee.<br/><br/>Sketch says "What the S function is SUPPOSED to be used for is substituions, like the percent substitions."<br/><br/>Coal takes out her little Sketch doll and removes the pins from the kidneys.<br/><br/>Br'fin says "Or the square brackets"<br/><br/>Kahlua pats Coal on the head.<br/><br/>Sketch says "It forces the TIM Parser to substitute the percent substitutions in immediately, before it generally goes after other aspects of the code."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Programmers who have been here a while now will stick in S() everywhere, to force the parser to deal with THAT first."<br/><br/>Sydney says "What happens if the parser doesn't do v(1) first in TOC?"<br/><br/>Br'fin randomly checks something for where he stuck in the S()<br/><br/>Sketch says "The functions or brackets or characters that force TIM to deal with the functions and code in special order is passed around like little mysterious trinkets among the coders."<br/><br/>Sketch says "THAT is something for another day."<br/><br/>Sketch says "So, very quickly, the TOC function in english:"<br/><br/>Kahlua traded S() for New York<br/><br/>Sketch says "cat(s(v(0)),repeat(switch(v(2),,.,mid(v(2),0,1)),sub(switch(v(3),,79,v(3)),add(strlen(v(0)),strlen(v(1))))),s(v(1)))"<br/><br/>Farward yawns. "G'nite."<br/><br/>From Farward's hand, hi ho waves goodbye.<br/><br/>Farward goes home.<br/><br/>Farward has left.<br/><br/>Sketch says "Combine the following: The First argument, followed by (either 79 or the third argument) (dots or the second argument), followed by the Second argument)."<br/><br/>Sketch says "That's it roughly."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Actually, it adds up the amount of the two first arguments and subtracts that from 79 (or the third argument)."<br/><br/>Sketch says "This function took me an evening to get write."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Right."<br/><br/>Br'fin says "Mmm, I tend to prefer to use s() internalyll when determining some names or attributes, but don't like interpreting user input, ever"<br/><br/>Sketch says "Don't think this stuff just shoots out of some people and you don't have the "knack"."<br/><br/>Sketch says "This is all experimentation and learning."<br/><br/>Popsnuh says "Ok. I don't feel like such a lame ass."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Now, any questions, about ANYTHING."<br/><br/>Popsnuh says "Not yet. I'm trying to digest everything."<br/><br/>R'nice says "Why did Moses hit the rock instead of speaking to it?"<br/><br/>Coal says "What's the meaning of life?"<br/><br/>Kylene says "OK, totally unrelated to what we're discussing..."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Because then we'd be praying to him instead of Jesus, and the whole thing would collapse into shit."<br/><br/>cylver says "How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?"<br/><br/>Sketch says "Footrubs."<br/><br/>Sketch says "40 pounds."<br/><br/>Popsnuh says "Are those Bugel Boy jeans you're wearing?"<br/><br/>Sketch says "Why, yes."<br/><br/>Coal says "Snuh, he's in boxers."<br/><br/>Popsnuh says "AAAAAA"<br/><br/>Sketch says "It's OK. Now I'm out!"<br/><br/>Coal could send you a picture?<br/><br/>Br'fin eeks, Sketch is now out of his boxers?<br/><br/>Sketch says "Hit me with that question, Kylene!"<br/><br/>Kylene grins.<br/><br/>Reo says "Bugle boy. Because we really, really wanted to call them Bulge Boy."<br/><br/>Kylene says "OK, A while ago I made an object that had a command on it 'play &amp;lr;whatever&amp;gr;' but now it doesn't work anymore... apparently there's a recent command or function or something, 'play', but there's no help for it."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Yes, that was recently added and I didn't document it yet."<br/><br/>Kylene says "OK."<br/><br/>cylver says "Try play curses"<br/><br/>Sketch says "This occasionally happens when we add new commands. It breaks some things."<br/><br/>Kylene sees a better way to program the thing anyway, after tonight. :)<br/><br/>Sketch says "New commands are added very rarely, compared to @commands and functions."<br/><br/>Sketch frolics around foolishly!<br/><br/>cylver says "There's a notice in the MUSHRoom about the play command."<br/><br/>R'nice *added* the play command, and still got bitten by it breaking an object of his :)<br/><br/>Sketch hopes this has been informative, even with the many mistakes.<br/><br/>Br'fin giggles<br/><br/>Popsnuh says "Yes."<br/><br/>Kylene says "It sure has. Thanks a lot."<br/><br/>Sydney says "Thank you, Sketch!"<br/><br/>Sketch says "Some of this code has been years old, so I didn't quite remember it all."<br/><br/>Coal goes home.<br/><br/>Coal has left.<br/><br/>Kylene yawns, gathers up her notes, and wanders off to bed.<br/><br/>Sketch mooos.<br/><br/>Kylene says "Night, all!"<br/><br/>Popsnuh says "Nuight!"<br/><br/>Sketch says "Less crap left around."<br/><br/>Kylene goes home.<br/><br/>Kylene has left.<br/><br/>Sydney goes home.<br/><br/>Sydney has left.<br/><br/>Br'fin says "Random things, it can be quite useful o write code offline. and then put the code all one one line when you're reayd to paste it onto TIM"<br/><br/>Squeaky says "Thanks, Sketch. I'm getting code better, thanks to you"<br/><br/>Reo wipes his ass with the transcript he got tonight.<br/><br/>Sketch is always around to answer any questions, if in the next few days you really get into it.<br/><br/>Reo says "Nice, reliable modem."<br/><br/>Kahlua says "Thanks Sketch."<br/><br/>Sketch bows.<br/><br/>Sketch heads out to the Nexus.<br/><br/>Sketch has left.<br/><br/>
