"Speak now if you want to be edited<br/>out of the log or forever hold your peace. ;o"<br/>Dunross chuckles, "I'm cool with it."<br/>Moth is cool<br/>Parity says "Dunross, you don't already have an object. You'll need one for the practical<br/>parts of class. Make one with '@create &lt;some object name&gt;' and then '@lock/uselock &lt;some<br/>object name&gt;=me' and '@set &lt;some object name&gt;=visual'"<br/>(post-log addendum: also, @set &lt;some object name&gt;=commands)<br/>Dunross nods.<br/>Parity says "Visual lets me see what you've done, and the uselock means only -you- can<br/>trigger the commands you put on the object, which is helpful if we all create a command<br/>with the same name. :)"<br/>Dunross nods.<br/>Moth grins<br/>Dunross finishes.<br/>Dunross says "Okay, I changed it to a gondola."<br/>Moth lafs<br/>Moth almost did that<br/>Dunross chuckles, "might as well."<br/>Parity says "Okee, in the last class I introduced $-commands in a kind of 'do this' way,<br/>and we created commands by making attributes like, '&amp;my-cmd myobject=$command:@pemit <br/>%#=Something'"<br/>Dunross nods.<br/>Parity says "Everybody understand that?"<br/>Dunross nods, has done that a lot.<br/>Moth noddles<br/>Parity nods, "Good. :) Now, you can do more with commands than that, as you might have<br/>noticed. Commands often take arguments, like '+finger &lt;some name&gt;'<br/>Dunross says "So +finger is basically a command string with a lot formatting in the emit?"<br/>Parity nods, "That's precisely it."<br/>Moth says "Ahhhhhh"<br/>Dunross nods, "Okie. Huh."<br/>Parity says "Now, the way we get arguments into our command is pretty simple. When we<br/>make a $-command, we can put a '*' anywhere we want to allow arbitrary text."<br/>Parity says "For example, '&amp;echo-cmd myobj=$echo *:@pemit %#=You typed '%0'.' will create<br/>an 'echo' command that will tell you what you typed."<br/>Parity invites everyone to try making a command like that.<br/>Moth says "Is that what folks do to have a pemit that 'so and so just looked at you'?"<br/>Moth says "Basically?"<br/>Parity says "Not quite. That's more like the drop/adrop/odrop example from last class.<br/>There's a set of those attributes, desc/adesc/odesc."<br/>Dunross says "Oh, did I need to se my object COMMANDS?"<br/>Parity says "Desc is what people see when they look at you, obviously."<br/>Moth nods... wasn't sure if it was similar or not<br/>Parity says "Adesc is an arbitrary action that happens when somebody looks at you."<br/>Moth says "Oh yeah you do, Dun"<br/>Dunross nods.<br/>Parity says "So, '@adesc me=@pemit me=%n just looked at you.' does that."<br/>Moth says "Ah okay... thanks;)"<br/>Dunross ahs!<br/>Dunross gets the gondola to speak!<br/>Moth lafs<br/>Parity grins.<br/>Parity says "If you can drop your objects so I can see your work..."<br/>Dunross nods.<br/>Moth sets Prospero down.<br/>Dunross dropped gondola.<br/><br/>Prospero:<br/>ECHO-CMD:$echo *:@pemit %#=You typed '%0'.<br/><br/>Prospero wiggles his way across the floor in search of raisins.<br/><br/>gondola:<br/>ECHO-CMD:$echo *:@pemit %#=You typed '%0'.<br/><br/>Moth grins<br/>Moth offers Prospero a raisin.<br/>Parity nods, "Okee. Now, you don't have to limit yourself to a trailing '*' that gets put<br/>into %0. A lot of the time you want a command that takes two arguments, like '+mail <br/>bob=subject'.<br/>Parity says "That's easily handled, with a command like "$twoargs *=*:@pemit #384=You<br/>claim that '%0' is equal to '%1'." ..."<br/>Parity invites everyone to try that.<br/>Parity says "Err."<br/>Parity says "With %#, not my dbref. :)"<br/>Moth grins, you sure?;)<br/>Parity is sure. :)<br/>Dunross says "Do you have to do the &amp; part for the attribute?"<br/>Parity nods, "Sorry, I was doing shorthand... what I typed was only the value.

"Yes, Dunross?"<br/>Dunross says "So in your last example with the oops, in the paired if-then,<br/>#-1 NOT FOUND,is not a player, the bit with the Oops -- is like an 'if' with no<br/>'then' or was it like a second 'then' with the previous 'is not a player'?"<br/>Parity uhms.<br/>Parity says "If you think of switch as a chain of 'if-then-else' statements,"<br/>Moth says "It's the else part of that"<br/>Parity says "The default case is the final 'else'"<br/>Moth says "like the Bigger than two"<br/>Parity says "<br/>IF 0 THEN<br/>        NOT CONNECTED ; <br/>ELSE IF 1 THEN<br/>        CONNECTED ; <br/>ELSE IF #-1 NOT FOUND THEN<br/>        NOT PLAYER ; <br/>ELSE<br/>         ERROR<br/>ENDIF<br/>"<br/>Dunross ahs and noddles.<br/>Dunross says "Okay, right, sorry. if-then-else."<br/>Dunross says "So you can see each sequence after the first as a series of elses, in a way?"<br/>Parity nods to Dunross, "Yes. switch() is very much like a chain of if-then-else. It<br/>is actually possible to make switches where more than one thing matches, but there is<br/>an implicit else in there.<br/>Parity says "So only the first match will be 'true'."<br/>Dunross nods.<br/>Moth nods<br/>Parity notes that in conditions '*' matches anything and '?' matches any single character.<br/>"I don't want to go into that today, but remember it so you'll understand why a '*' or a<br/>'?' in a condition has unexpected results."<br/>Dunross nods.<br/>Parity says "Okee. ;)0"<br/>Parity says "Now, let's talk about the -other- switch, the command '@switch'."<br/>Parity says "Try typing in, '@switch 0=0,zero,1,one'"<br/>Parity says "err."<br/>Parity says "Don't. :)"<br/>Moth lafs<br/>Dunross says "Heh."<br/>Parity says "Try typing in, '@switch 0=0,say zero,1,say one'"<br/>Dunross says "zero"<br/>Parity says "And then, '@switch 1=0,say zero,1,say one'"<br/>Moth says "zero"<br/>Dunross says "one"<br/>Moth says "one"<br/>Parity says "Try typing in, '@switch something=0,say zero,1,say one,say unexpected value'"<br/>Dunross says "unexpected value"<br/>Moth says "unexpected value"<br/>Dunross reads those statements again.<br/>Dunross nods.<br/>Parity nods, "You'll notice that, except for being a command, @switch behaves very much<br/>like switch(). It's a series of if-then-elses, but instead of 'evaluating' to 'say zero'<br/>it 'executes' the command 'say zero'.<br/>Moth ahhhhs<br/>Dunross says "That's important."<br/>Dunross says "The distinction, that is."<br/>Parity nods!<br/>Parity says "Very."<br/>Dunross says "So, which is better? Does one take up more mush-brain than the other?"<br/>Parity says "You should use switch() instead of @switch when you can."<br/>Dunross nods.<br/>Parity says "switch() is better, for two reasons; it's more efficient, and it lets you<br/>reuse more code."<br/>Parity says "Let's re-implement our connected command with @switch."<br/>Dunross nods.<br/>Moth nods<br/>Parity says "&amp;newswitch-cmd myobj=$newswitch *:@switch hasflag(*%0,connected)=0,@pemit<br/>%#=Not connected,1,@pemit %#=Connected,#-1 NOT FOUND,@pemit %#=Not a player,@pemit<br/>%#=Error."<br/>Dunross says "Ack don't tell me yet! ;)"<br/>Parity will give you an exercise soon, it promises. ;)<br/>Parity says "Hopefully what I typed is something like what you were doing? Is it clear<br/>to everyone?"<br/>Moth nods<br/>Moth needs syntax, trust me;p<br/>Dunross nods, is still doing it, "Yes, I had started '@switch 0=0,is not connected'<br/>instead..?<br/>Dunross says "But you still have to use hasflag()."<br/>Parity says "Well, yes. :)"<br/>Parity says "hasflag is the function that tells you if someone is connected."<br/>Parity says "'@switch 0=0,is not connected' will -always- come back with 'is not<br/>connected'"<br/>Parity says "Because '0' always evaluates to '0'."<br/>Moth says "Like I did earlier with putting Scaramouche in the command?"<br/>Parity says "Worse, you won't see anything, because it will try to executed 'is not<br/>connected' as a command, and your -object- will see 'Huh?' ... but the person<br/>invoking the command will see nothing."<br/>Moth says "Oh..."<br/>Parity says "So, in the @switch case we need an @pemit on -every- branch."<br/>Dunross blahs, tries to get it on the gondola.<br/>Parity says "In reality, we would never code this like this."<br/>Dunross says "Yeah, I like switch() better for that example."<br/>Parity says "You use @switch when you want to do very different things in each branch."<br/>Parity is just trying to keep it simple and familiar.<br/>Moth nods<br/>Parity says "And, while I'm at it, to demonstrate why and when switch() is<br/>preferable to @switch."<br/>Moth can see why switch() is preferred<br/>Moth says "Much less typing for starters"<br/>Dunross says "Clearer relationships between the if-then-else."<br/>Moth nods<br/>Dunross nods, gets it to work.<br/>Parity nods, "But you can do things in @switch that you simply cannot do in switch()."<br/>Dunross says "Really?"<br/>Parity nods.<br/>Parity says "Type, 'help commands' ..."<br/>Parity says "Err."<br/>Parity says "try, 'help command list' rather. :)"<br/>  Help available for MUSH Commands:<br/> <br/>  drop         enter        examine      get          give         goto<br/>  help         inventory    kill         leave        LOGOUT       look<br/>  move         news         OUTPUTPREFIX OUTPUTSUFFIX page         pose<br/>  PUEBLOCLIENT QUIT         read         say          score        SESSION<br/>  take         throw        use          version      whisper      WHO<br/>  "            :            ;

You were so patient, seriously."<br/>Moth says "Summary syntax would be nice, actually:)"<br/>Parity says "An attribute is set with, '&amp;&lt;attribute-name&gt; &lt;object-name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;"<br/>Parity says "A value like, '$&lt;something&gt;:&lt;something&gt;' is a command."<br/>Parity says "'&amp;my-cmd myobj=$mine:@pemit %#=It's all mine!' will create a command<br/>'mine' on 'myobj' that will pemit 'It's all mine!' to the invoker."<br/>Parity says "If you use '*' in the command format, any string will match the '*',<br/>and you can get what the invoker typed with '%0' for the first *, %1 for the<br/>second *, and so on, up to '%9' for the tenth *."<br/>Parity says "'&amp;my-cmd myobj=$mine *:@pemit #384=%0 is all mine!' will pemit,<br/>for example, 'The ferret is all mine!' if you type 'mine ferret'"<br/>Parity says "'&amp;my-cmd myobj=$mine *:@pemit %#=%0 is all mine!' will pemit,<br/>for example, 'The ferret is all mine!' if you type 'mine ferret'"<br/>Parity says "switch() is a function; functions replace themselves with text<br/>according to certain rules. switch() has special 'if-then-else' rules for<br/>what it is replaced with."<br/>Parity says "switch(1,1,one,0,zero,unexpected value) is replaced with 'one'."<br/>Parity says "Functions are evaluated from the inside out, so you can put a<br/>function inside of a function."<br/>Parity says "switch(hasflag(me,connected),1,one,0,zero,unexpected value) is<br/>replaced with 'one' if you're connected, 'zero' if you're not, and 'unexpected<br/>value' if you're on a MUSH that doesn't know about the special word 'me' and<br/>tries to find an object named 'me'."<br/>Moth chuckles<br/>Parity says "switch(hasflag(#1,connected),1,one,0,zero,unexpected value) is replaced<br/>with 'one' if 'God' is connected, 'zero' if 'God' is not connected, and 'unexpected<br/>value' only if something is really weird and #1 is not a player."<br/>Parity says "@switch is like switch(), except that instead of replacing itself with<br/>a value, it executes a set of commands."<br/>Parity says "'@switch 1=1,say one,0,say zero,say unexpected value' makes the<br/>executing object (You if you type in directly, the command-object if you put<br/>it in a command) do the command 'say one'."<br/>Parity says "'@switch hasflag(#1,connected)=0,@pemit %#=God is not connected,<br/>1,@pemit %#=God is not connected,@pemit %#=What? God is not a player?' will<br/>@pemit a different thing depending on whether 'hasflag()' (a function, which<br/>should replace itself with some text) replaces itself with '1' '0' or some<br/>error message."<br/>Parity says "When writing an @switch, you can use %0 from a command argument<br/>as your 'first argument/test argument' value."<br/>Parity says "And you should put your commands inside of curly braces {}."<br/>Dunross says "You type too fast, Parity. And I type fast. :P"<br/>Parity says "'&amp;switch-cmd myobj=$myswitch *:@switch %0=hi,@pemit #384=Well,<br/>hi there!,bye,@pemit %#=Good-bye, then!,@pemit %#=What?' will create a command<br/>that pemits 'Well, hi there!' if you do 'myswitch hi', 'Good-bye, then!' if you<br/>do 'myswitch bye', and 'What?' if you do anything else. The curly braces mark<br/>off your commands, so you can have commas that are not treated special as part<br/>of the @switch, you can put a whole string of commands seperated by ';' inside<br/>instead of one @pemit, etc."<br/>Parity says "And, finally, you can get help with 'help command list' 'help<br/>function list' 'help switch()' 'help @switch' and others. ;)"<br/>Moth has to note for the record that you've been great, horrendously patient,<br/>extremely courteous and folks need to take advantage of these classes... When<br/>can we do this again?<br/>Parity says "help hasflag() for instance. :)"<br/>Parity expects to hold another class in two weeks.<br/>Moth says "Woo!"<br/>Moth will be there...<br/>Dunross says "Most excellent."<br/>Parity says "That seems like a good amount of time between classes. :)"<br/>Parity says "Any more questions?"<br/>Moth nods, allows brain cells to rejuvenate, hopefully<br/>Parity grins.<br/>Dunross says "Moth is right, Parity. I've been in environments for 10 years and that<br/>was the most patient coder-lesson experience I've ever had."<br/>Moth says "And if you can teach -me- to code, you can teach -anyone-... ;)"<br/>Dunross says "Yeah. Moths are slow. ;)"<br/>Parity has an ulterior motive.. if it can teach people to code, the will be more<br/>code-wizards and it will be less overworked... :)<br/>Moth chuckles<br/>Dunross laughs, "No joke. That's how you do it."<br/>Dunross says "Thanks a million. :)"<br/>Moth says "Well, I will try.."<br/>Parity says "No problem. :)"<br/>Moth says "Thanks a mill..."<br/>Parity has a question for all you now. :)<br/>Prospero dropped Ball.<br/>Houston, we have lift-off. The ferret launches the ball across the room.<br/>Dunross says "Oh, God. Is that what you made today?"<br/>Moth says "Oh sure"<br/>Dunross says "Oh, certainment."<br/>Parity says "Do you have any idea what you'd like to see addressed in the<br/>next session?"<br/>Moth is so new to coding, I wouldn't be able to tell you...<br/>Moth says "I mean, I guess that's evident;p"<br/>Parity grins.<br/>Ball has left.<br/>The ferret gets the ball. Clever Prospero!<br/>Dunross says "Well, I like trying to understand the functions. I mean, we are<br/>pretty functional...both Moth and I have built and done things, but again, it's<br/>not efficient or taking advantage of things like switch()."<br/>Parity says "Well, I expect it to be phrased as 'how to do X' not 'how to use the<br/>such-n-such command' ;)"<br/>Moth nods...<br/>Moth needs to figure out how to build.... water... laf<br/>Dunross says "I'd like to see stuff on how to set up a Master Room. laf. ;)<br/>Functions on objects, globals, etc."<br/>Moth says "Weather"<br/>Dunross says "Oi. Weather."<br/>Parity mmmmmms.<br/>Moth says "We've got to figure that out tho..."<br/>Dunross says "I like the exercise method you did Parity, adding each time."<br/>Dunross says "And that means I can keep my object with the bits on it to review."<br/>Moth nods<br/>Parity says "Everything I've taught you can be applied to master room objects.<br/>Perhaps we'll try to cover user-functions and other neat tricks next time."<br/>Moth says "Hands on is critical"<br/>Moth nods, cool<br/>Prospero dribbles it up the middle like Julius Erving!<br/>Parity nods, and agrees that hands on is critical.<br/>Dunross nods, has figured out a master room in the backyard of his own place,<br/>but that doesn't really mean much, save it manages to work.<br/>Parity says "Okay, so you like cumulative exercises. What was the thing you<br/>-least- liked in this lecture?"<br/>Dunross says "Least?"<br/>Parity nods.<br/>Moth says "The fact that I was slow... ;)"<br/>Parity can't improve if it doesn't know what it does wrong.<br/>Parity says "And I don't believe I was perfect. :)"<br/>Moth says "I think it was pretty straight-forward..."<br/>Dunross says "Nothing really. I liked working on just a set of related commands.<br/>I liked the exercises. I liked the steps you took and were patient. I thought it<br/>was all well done. When it got slow, it was due to 1. us needing a few minutes<br/>to sort it out, 2. you mistyped something, which happens, no big deal."<br/>Moth says "Maybe give a couple of practical uses for the code bits..."<br/>Moth says "Like...you can use this to do blah"<br/>Parity nods thoughtfully.<br/>Moth says "That's where I have trouble sometimes... figuring out what I'd do with it"<br/>Dunross says "True, maybe then continue work on a project? Like you may have our small<br/>items to practice syntax on, but then we're simultanously working on a larger project<br/>and adding to it each week?"<br/>Parity says "Yes... I think I did that with the 'mywho' from the first lecture, but<br/>not so much in this lecture."<br/>Dunross says "So I could keep Bix, but I also know that I'm trying to work on<br/>Weather stuff at my own place and so maybe relating the two might assist?"<br/>Parity will need to think of a project that uses the techniques. ;o<br/>Moth nods<br/>Moth thinks that having at least one practical application for a section of code<br/>learned would be a great way to tie it all together<br/>Moth says "That'd really be my only suggestion. I think the rest is great..."<br/>Dunross nods. "Well, yer making your ferret, yes? You know how to do the basic<br/>bits to code an animal."<br/>Moth says "Right..."<br/>Parity nods. "Well... truthfully... @switch isn't practical except in the largest<br/>most complex applications, but when you need it, you need it. ;o"<br/>Dunross says "Feed, pet, play."<br/>Moth says "Right... is just saying some of the switch stuff might relate well to<br/>other things I wouldn't think to use it for... b/c of my lack of experience"<br/>Moth says "That's all..."<br/>Parity often does, for example, '@switch hasflag(%#,wizard)=1,one set of actions,0,<br/>another set of actions'<br/>Dunrossnods on switch. "Actually, I have something that might be improved by @switch<br/>my own place, but still, I'm glad we know it...the travelling metaphor, Moth."<br/>Moth doesn't know how it might apply, if at all, to different things, like weather...<br/>or the transportation code on Myriad. That's all.<br/>Dunross nods at Parity, "Exactly."<br/>Parity says "But only when I need a command named the same thing to behave very differently."<br/>Moth nods<br/>Dunross nods, "Yeah, our transport is more a string of emits and then a teleport."<br/>Dunross says "Switch might be overkill. ;)"<br/>Moth nods<br/>Dunross says "But you get the idea. :)"<br/>Moth says "Anyhoo...that'd be my suggestion..."<br/>Parity says "Usually you can stick a 'switch(hasflag(%#,wizard), ... ' into the<br/>text to add extra info for staff."<br/>Parity will work on it. ;)<br/>Dunross says "Thanks again, Parity. ;)"<br/>Moth says "Otherwise, it's great as it is... I think you're doing a fabulous job..."<br/>Moth says "Thanks muchly..."<br/>Dunross says "How does the log stuff work? Does Sio put it up?"<br/>Parity says "Thank you!"<br/>Parity nods.<br/>Dunross cools.<br/>Parity says "The logs will be posted at http://members.fortunecity.com/ogr/"<br/>Parity says "Under 'resources'"<br/>Moth nods, cool<br/>Dunross grabs Bix and runs. :)<br/>Prospero dropped Ball.<br/>Houston, we have lift-off. The ferret launches the ball across the room.<br/>Dunross says "Till next time then. :)"<br/>Moth grins<br/>Parity says "Class dismissed! :)"<br/>Dunross salutes. :)<br/>Parity waves.<br/>Ball has left.<br/>The ferret gets the ball. Clever Prospero!<br/>Dunross laughs.<br/>Dunross goes home.<br/>Dunross has left.<br/><br/>
