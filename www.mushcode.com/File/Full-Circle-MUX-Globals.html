She has expressed interest in becoming a vampire hunter as she was in her background. I've talked to Fundip about this and he says it won't unbalance things as long as she doesn't grab a bung of garou to help her out. So the plan is, as long as there are no objections, to let her become a vamp hunter in secret and away from the sept. If the sept find out she should be punished for violating the peace treaty. Let me know your thoughts on all this. (Her alias is 'sk' if you want to look her over.)<br/>- Pez<br/><br/>-----------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>The above is FYI.

"Would you care for some green tea or coffee, Mister...?" He answered a minute later, "I would very much enjoy some tea, please Ms. Jones and you may call me Doctor Lester." She brewed the teas and delivered them, she noticed the time as 0230. Taking a seat across from him, Dr. Lester smiled and poured milk into his mug. "I can understand how alarming this must be to you, Ms. Jones, but I assure you - your work is very important and neccesary. Would you consider remaining in Investigations in some manner? Perhaps if not for an agency, then how about privately? I am assuming you will have no difficulty with permits and bonds?" Mace considered this, his manner so concerned that she felt compelled to cooperate.<br/>  "Frankly Doctor, I have considered licensing as a private investigator. Even more frank, I want to know what I was dealing with. On both cases you tipped us on... How can I put this?" She hesitated searching for the right words to discuss what she felt were supernatural and non-existant things.

Though Miguel's background was creative and well-written, he would not work well in a MU* environment, where killing PCs is highly discouraged. Also, due to the fact that there are only a few Hunters on this MUX at any given time, I am being very picky about the backgrounds I approve; they must be long (at least a page and a half), and very detailed.

I really only see two workable solutions to this. One, he's killed. The other, he strikes up quid pro quo with the director of the NSA and the head of DSI, agreeing to feed them information directly on matters of national security in New Hope, in return for them partially reinstating him and getting off his back. Also, they have to replace the security deposit on his apartment, since it's their fault it got all messed up. Plus they have the pay the cat's medical bills. ;)He'll also agree to work part-time as an instructor for the NSA, maybe spending a few weeks there every few months, working with their covert action groups.<br/>&amp;N_MAIL_PAULS_RELEASE Notebook=Well DSI is letting Paul go because of the Arcanum's influence in the matter. They will no longer want anythign to do with Paul, but if he does leak any information, they will be forced to take appropriate actions. (OOC: Death, or worse).

All that Paul told Brave was this: that Paul had once worked for the NSA, and that if the NSA found Paul, Paul might vanish one morning and end up vivasected 'like a few others of my team were.' This was disinformation Paul was feeding Brave -- no member of Team 7, to Paul's knowledge, was vivasected. It's purpose was to shake Brave some and try to get him to talk. Well, it didn't quite work out the way Paul wanted, but that's fine.

I began judging a scene last night with Samantha, Robert, Chang Li, and Leah. The scene began in Nature's Promise. (A couple of other people were there but did not get involved; I'm sorry, but I was too zoned to remember who they were. Maybe Gobstopper can help.) Samantha paged me saying that Chang Li wanted to meet her and she was afraid for her life, so could she please set up police reinforcements at Nature's Promise during the meeting. Gobby and I arranged for this. When the meeting was over, Leah Dominated Samantha into just letting Chang Li go, but Leah only got 1 success so I said that Samantha would not go to the extra effort of going up to the plainclothes officers and telling them to change their plans. So when CL and L left, the cops arrested them. Robert left just a few moments afterwards, and asked that a police officer allow him to take some pictures. He did, and those pictures will be turning up in the paper as soon as I get the article written.<br/>  Leah was in a bad mood OOC and was starting to make noises about how she was just hoping the sun would rise and she'd fry. I don't think she really meant it, but she didn't struggle and just let the cops cuff her and put her in the cruiser. Chang Li protested this, and said that he wouldn't go quietly unless they let her go. The cops said they needed to check both of their identities.<br/>  At this point I had to go offline, so Mentos very graciously offered to continue judging the scene for me. I do not know if it turned into a firefight or not; last I heard, Chang Li was considering going quietly as long as the cops took the cuffs off Leah and didn't cuff him. I'm not sure where he is now. I'll write a newspaper article as soon as I figure out exactly how everything turned out, along with some very nice pictures by Robert (who rolled very well on his photography skill, even though the difficulty was pretty high because of the chaos :) ) .

Croyd and Samantha, not being happy with exploring all the vampires' secret places, decided to rent a boat to explore the marshes. Ack! When Sammi paged me telling me this, I told her she was going to get a runaround from the people at the boathouse, saying that they refuse to rent boats out there. She insisted on RP'ing the scene, so she and Croyd came into my room and went through the conversation with the boathouse worker, a lanky, chain-smoking kid named Charlie.<br/>  Sammi flashed her badge which got the kid nervous and talking. He said that there were some troubles a few years ago, when an unspecified number of boats got damaged and an unspecified number of people got hurt and sued. It settled out of court. Since then, Charlie's father, who owns the boathouse, put it into his contracts that no boats will go out to the marshes.<br/>  Sammi thinks OOC that the damage to the boats and/or people was caused by the toxic dumping that was going on there a few game-months ago. Apparently Star told her IC about the dumping. The kid also mentioned alligators, but it doesn't look like either Croyd or Samantha took him seriously when he said that they were what his dad was really afraid of.<br/>  I wouldn't be surprised if Sammi and Croyd start exploring the marshes. I may have to judge those scenes. I wouldn't mind doing it but I'd like to talk to people with Garou alts and Pop Rocks and Elle/Phoebe if she's ever around and make sure that we have our stories straight. Also, it's looking like both of them are looking in the papers/police records for anything funny that's happened in the marshes over the past couple of years. I need to know what has made it into those records. I hope I did this scene okay, I was kind of at a loss because no Garou staff were online at the moment and I had to come up with a reason for them not to get boats really quick. :) I think everything I said was pretty much in line with Phoebe's earlier policies.

Chang Li used Presence 1 (awe), and suceeded in 'impressing' 2 officers so much that they were almost stepping on him to assist the Really Cool Guy into the squad car :). Everyone trooped down to the police station. Once there, Leah and Chang's ID were checked, and then they were released, since there wasn't actually anything they were being held for.<br/>  This came up as an issue: Leah said her character had an int of 4, and so should be smart enough to make sure she had 'legal' ID. Plus, that she had taken a trip and would have a passport left over from that.

Some go to a heaven or a hell or to the Realm of Fightin Spirits. The rest reincarnate into our mortal world; some as humans or animals and some, for their sins, as Gaki, hungry spirits.%r[space(5)]Buddist lore lists many different sorts of Gaki besides the Jiki-ketsu, the blood suckers. There are the Jiki-niku who eat flesh; the Jiki-da who eat tears; the Jiki-fun who eat excrement; the Jiki-doku who eat poison; the Jiki-fu who eat wind; the Jiki-ke who eat smells; and the Jiki-ka who eat fire.%r[space(5)]The only known gaki are the Jiki-ketsu. They claim their bloodline stems from teh firstborn child of Izanagi and Izanami, the Kami who created Japan. Japanese legend records that when these two first experimented with sex, the female Kami initiated it, and their child was a blood-sucking leech. The next time, the male Kami initiated sex and their child was Amaterasu, the Kami of the Sun, the founder of teh Japanese Imperial Line. Some Gaki harmonize this myth with Western Vampire lore by equating Izanagi with Caine and Izanami with Lilith, Adam's first wife, the Semitic demon godess who sucked children's blood by night. They therefore consider Japan to be the original Land of Nod.%r<br/>@lock All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki/TEXT.GAKI1<br/>&amp;TEXT.GAKI2 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=%r[space(5)]The standard Gaki initiation is held in a Gaki Buddist temple, in front of the bloodparents' friends and kindred. The new Gaki swears an oath of loyalty to the bloodparent for at least one lifetime and to the parent's Daimyo for seven lifetimes. The priest officiating then creates an ihai, a memorial tablet, bearing the Blood Name of the new Gaki. After the ceremony, this is kept in the temple. Due to the powerful psychological and mystical factors involved in the ritual, repudiating the oath sworn during the ceremony causes a Derangement if not a loss of Willpower as well.%r[space(5)]The new Gaki may undergo four of five years of euphoria in which social rules seem meaningless, much like the Japanese university student who revels in academic freedom and then, after graduating and getting a job, settles down. Perhaps this early maturation is due to being oathbound. In any case, a Gaki is accepted as a responsible member of immortal society almost immediately after becoming initiated. But until every mortal friend or relative or lover has died, a young Gaki is still called a wakemono, an apprentice, bound by ties of affection as much to the mortal as to the immortal world.%r<br/>@lock All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki/TEXT.GAKI2<br/>&amp;TEXT.GAKI3 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=%r[space(5)]Most Gaki are samurai, oathbound to a daimyo. A Gaki who is not oathbound to a Daimyo is called Ronin (literally wave-person, someone whose life is as unsettled as an ocean wave). So is a gaki who was repudiated by their daimyo, usually for 12 years, though sometimes for as long as a century. Sometimes such repudiation is conditional: "You are no samurai of mine as long as you permit this insult to me to go unavenged." A humiliated Gaki who has lost significant Status in the eyes of friends and daimyo may vow to go Ronin until they have accomplished some notable deed. Or perhaps the gaki will vow to go on a pilgrimage to 33 Chibo temples. If the humiliation is too great, the Gaki will commit suicide, since a newly reborn Gaki has standard Status.%r[space(5)]Two noble bloodlines of Gaki began in the 12th century when the great wars between the Heike and Genji shook Japan. The final combat was at teh bay of Dan-no-Ura when the Genji triumphed over the Heike, and Emperor Antoku and his followers leapt into the sea rather than surrender.%r<br/>@lock All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki/TEXT.GAKI3<br/>&amp;TEXT.GAKI4 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=%r[space(5)]Today each major Japanese city has two Gaki daimyo who try to ignore one another's existence; one Heike, one Genji. Smaller cities only have one daimyo - usually a Heike in the west, near the old Imperial capitol of Kyoto, a Genji in the east near the modern capitol of Tokyo. Some cities have daimyo named for one of the major feudal clans, such as the Takeda or the Oda.%r[space(5)]The Heike are proud of their ancient heritage and follow the old traditions, including loyalty to their samurai. Of course, they expect similar loyalty in return. At home, they usually dress in traditional Japanese grab, delighting in the arts of flower arranging, samisen playing, and swordsmanship and thinking of engineers and programmers as new sorts of magicians.

They are interested in computers, and it has been rumored some have a near-supernatural ability with electronics and hi-tech items. All of them have at least some talents similar to Dominate or Presense.%r[space(5)]These two bloodlines, besides greatly affecting the growth of technology in Japan, have begun looking for ways to expand Japan's influence (and thus their own). Despite the fact taht for most of their history they have remained on Japan and its associated islands, during and after World War II they have expanded into Hong Kong, Shanghai and other nearby areas. Indeed, they are making a concerted effort to become the primary force of Undead on Hong Kong when it is turned over to China, a fact which does not sit well with those other Eastern Vampires aware of their plans.%r<br/>@lock All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki/TEXT.GAKI5<br/>&amp;TEXT.GAKI6 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=%r[space(5)]The other Gaki bloodlines do not have as great an interest in areas outside Japan as do the Heike and Genji, but members of their houses have made trips to Hong Kong.%r[space(5)]The Iga and the Koga are ancient ninja clans, organized into groups of one or two dozen people. Some Iga groups serve the Heike, some the Genji; some Koga groups serve the Heike and some serve the Genji. All Iga pay tribute to their clan chief, the Iga Kashira, who is not allied with either Heike or Genji. All Koga likewise pay tribute to the Koga Kashira. At times Iga and Koga cooperate, but it is an uneasy alliance; they are old enemies. Some of them know the new lore of technology. All of them are experts in martial arts and stealth; many are experts in drugs and poisons.%r[space(5)]The Chibo are Buddhist priests, who have a special scripture, unknown to other Buddhists: The Blood Sutra.

The zaibatsu guarantee employment for the employee's lifetime, and those affiliated with a Gaki stay on with the firm even after they've died. A few bloodlines are affiliated with various yakuza mobs, gambler ganges controlling Japanese crime much as the Mafia runs it in the United States.%r[space(5)]The Gaki do not number their generations, because adoption is too widespread a custom: a Gaki's status depends on the current bloodparent, not the initial one. Some Gaki have two bloodparents: their first contact and the city's daimyo. Some Gaki were initiated by the daimyo but then adopted by someone of lower Status.

They distrust gaiji (foreigners) as donors, partially do to the rumor that many of them carry the HIV virus. A gaijin who has the Linguistics points to speak Japanese still counts as having a Speech Impediment and must gain an additional Linguistics point to be able to read Japanese or count as Illiterate. They are one level lower Status than usual as seen by Japanese.%r[space(5)]Some Gaki believe that Hengeyokai, shapechanging Cats, are above them in the karmic order. Bu they still consider themselves more cultured than hegeyokai and believe that their donors enjoy a better life, particularly since a Gaki is able to give immortatily to a donor, while an animal cannot.%r[space(5)]A few Gaki have persuaded Hengeyokai Cats to serve them. Mostly, Gaki have mortal servants, sometimes hirelings, sometimes old friends or lovers who serve them out of affection. A number of Heike and Genji have mortal families who pride themselves on being samurai to the undead. No Japanese Gaki are known to have vitae-fed mortal servants like the Western Vampire's Ghoul.%r<br/>&amp;TEXT.DIFFERENCE1 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=%r[space(5)]Gaki have a highly limited class of potential victims. They can only feed from people who have the right temperament to become Gaki themselves. The Chibo priests explain that this is part of the Karmic Wheel, which punishes sins of Unrestrained Desire with one or more lifetimes plagued with Hunger. Certainly, the Gaki cannot feed upon people either too young to desire fame, power or pleasure or too enlightened for such desires. Gaki also do not feed on the blood of animals or of other Gaki. As yet, no research has been done to indicate if Western Vampires are able to feed on the blood of Gaki.%r[space(5)]The Hunger affects Gaki perception. If they are down to wo or fewer Blood Points, their vision becomes focused on seeking a Donor. They literally lose sight of the rest of the world and see only potential victims and drifting fog. They can temporarily focus on the blurred world only as an act of Willpower.

What sleep they do get is troubled by nightmares of mingled desire and fear: trapped in a wilderness with nothing to drink but the blood of their dearest friends, or running endlessly over a field of bones from the approach of Fugen, a Buddhist spirit wreathed in fire and whose sword is a long flame.

They cannon pass under the torii gate marked the entrace to the Shinto shrine, which is taboo to anyone ill, injured, in mourning, or bleeding (including mestruating women). Most Gaki cannot enter a non-Chibo Buddhist temple or any room sealed with o-fude, strips of papers on which the Buddhist scriptures have been written.%r[space(5)]A few Gaki honor some Western figures as among the Buddha's many incarnations.

These nightmares are no mere constructs of their own brittle psyche; they manifest as actual dimensional rifts, personalized for the individual Gaki. Since making contact with the West, some Gaki have compared their own situations with that of the Christian damned, caught up in an individual hell.%r[space(5)]Each rift differs substantially from any other. Based on the gaki's own traumas, fears, shames and guilt, the rift epitomizes all the tragedy of her existence. When they sleep, their mind fills with images from this realm - demons, fears, shames; all the travesties they have perpatrated return to them a hundredfold.%r[space(5)]However, the Gaki manifest at least some control of their rifts. Young Gaki learn to extend their rift out ot touch other people. As they grow older, they learn to draw others in. Using the realm of one's own nightmares can be a terrifying experience. Use of any of the powers listed below, successful or not, requires a Courage roll against a difficulty of the power's level; failure costs the Gaki a minimum of one Willpower point, and botchs can send the Gaki writhing in disgust at her own sins.%r<br/>@lock All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki/TEXT.RIFT<br/>&amp;TEXT.RIFT1 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=%r[space(5)]Level 1: The Joining%r%r[space(5)]Sometimes called 'tsutaeru' by the Gaki, this power allows them to silently communicate with both those around them and other Gaki. While this does not allow mind reading, attempts to communicate with Gaki are automatically successful unless teh other Gaki is blocking such contact, and can be made over any distance. Communicating with non-Gaki requires the user of this power to be within eyesight of his target and make a Wits + Linguistics roll against a difficulty of 7.%r<br/>@lock All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki/TEXT.RIFT1<br/>&amp;TEXT.RIFT2 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=%rLevel 2: Glimpse of the Pain%r%r[space(5)]With the second level of Rift, the gaki begins to draw others into her realm of agony, if only for a moment. This power, called 'tsukamu', allows (forces) a target to see the Gaki's own rift. This look at a whole microverse of guilt, sin, frustration, and horror is often more than most can handle. Being blind or closing one's eyes can lessen the agony, but the rift is a complete sensory and psychic experience, so the victim may still be affected (Storyteller's discretion).%r[space(5)]The target, if a Vampire or Gaki, must make a Courage roll with a difficulty of his own Humanity + 2 not to fall into a Courage Frenzy. For others, the Gaki must make a Perception + Intimidation roll with a difficulty of 6, resisted by the target's Willpower roll against the same difficulty. Each additional success the Gaki achieves means the target is incapacitated for an additional turn, frozen with horror at the monstrosity just seen.%r<br/>@lock All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki/TEXT.RIFT2<br/>&amp;TEXT.RIFT3 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=%rLevel 3: Crossing the Iron Bridge%r%r[space(5)]At this stage in a Gaki's development, she begins to deal with her own inner demons. This power allows her to enter into her rift, confronting all that which makes it such hell. The Gaki actually disappears from teh place she was, and will reappear there shortly.%r[space(5)]This is by no means a pleasant experience, and teh character must make a Self-Control roll with a difficulty of her own Conscience for every turn they remain here. Some Gaki use this power for protection, some use it to deal with their own guilt, and some are rumored to have entering into their rift never to return again.%r<br/>&amp;TEXT.RIFT4 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=%rLevel 4: Journeying the Iron Bridge%r%r[space(5)]When a Gaki first becomes able to Cross the Iron Bridge, all he can take with him are tose inanimate items which have a personal connection - clothes keepsakes, etc. - and these for just a short time. With the fourth level of this power, the Gaki can take anything with him, but he must make a Stamina + Survival roll against a difficulty of 6. Failure means any item brought in falls from wherever the Gaki was holding it. In addition, the Gaki can stay in the rift for as long as he wants... or can.%r<br/>@lock All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki/TEXT.RIFT4<br/>&amp;TEXT.RIFT5 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=%rLevel 5: Passing the Inner Realm%r%r[space(5)]At this point the Gaki begins to learn how to manipulate the rift, using this horror to her own advantage. While the rift is not infinite, it is subject only to the limits placed on it by the Storyteller. Thus the Gaki can travel through it, invisible to the outside world, to any point he could see before entering the rift. She can even enter the rifts of other Gaki she could see before using this power.%r<br/>&amp;SUM_GAKI1 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=The Gaki's thoughts on their creation.<br/>&amp;SUM_GAKI2 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=Gaki initiation description.<br/>&amp;SUM_GAKI3 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=Oaths and Gaki thinking.<br/>&amp;SUM_GAKI4 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=The Heike Bloodline<br/>&amp;SUM_GAKI5 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=The Genji Bloodline<br/>&amp;SUM_GAKI6 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=The Iga and Koga Bloodlines.<br/>&amp;SUM_GAKI7 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=The Gaki and generations...<br/>&amp;SUM_GAKI8 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=Prejudice, Enemies, and Ghouling<br/>&amp;SUM_DIFFERENCE1 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=Feeding restrictions and hungry frenzies.<br/>&amp;SUM_DIFFERENCE2 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=Sunlight and sleep<br/>&amp;SUM_DIFFERENCE3 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=Eating and Drinking and religious superstition<br/>&amp;SUM_DIFFERENCE4 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=The Beast and reincarnation<br/>&amp;SUM_VOCABULARY All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=Some common Gaki vocabulary words.<br/>&amp;SUM_RIFT All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=A description of the Rift Discipline and its general overview.<br/>&amp;SUM_RIFT1 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=Rift Level 1: The Joining<br/>&amp;SUM_RIFT2 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=Rift Level 2: Glimpse of the Pain<br/>&amp;SUM_RIFT3 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=Rift Level 3: Crossing the Iron Bridge<br/>&amp;SUM_RIFT4 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=Rift Level 4: Journey the Iron Bridge<br/>&amp;SUM_RIFT5 All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=Rift Level 5: Passing the Inner Realm<br/>&amp;HELP.GAKI All you ever wanted to know and then some about Gaki=$gakihelp:@pemit %#=[repeat(=,79)]%r[space(5)]The following commands are available on the Gaki machine.

Her parents as different as night and day. They hated each other, using Morgan almost from the moment of birth as a pawn to get back at each other. Her mother, French by descent, a one time actress, and model, that is until most of Ca fell into the ocean. Her father, Italian, part of small yer powerful mafia family. Her parents were not meant for each other, it was obvious. They met When he came to Dragon Moon, the shop her mother owned, for a tattoo. The one night stand layered on booze ended up porducing a marriage and Morgan. As soo as Morgan could say 'ga ga' her mother taught her french, just because it would piss her father off. When she was five her mother sent her to piano lessons and 'jazz' dancing lessons. Morgan didn't much care for either. During the same time her father, who said, it wa because she was going to be so pretty, that she needed to learn sefl defense. So In addition to the piano and jazz she took a beginning course in self defense, even at that age her agility was quite apparent. As Morgan entered into school she began to act out some, she disliked most of school save for phsysical education and art classes, she loved to draw, but even more, she loved to paint. Not paying much attention to other things like math and science She after fourth grade she stopped the piano and dance, instead prefering to goto to art camps in the summer, her father thought she had potential to be a better athelete but she was too young and didn't care too much about sports. She did like to use her hands and to run but that was about all she liked at that time.<br/>&amp;BGTWO bg object=As she entered into Middle school at the age of 11 she took every elective possible in art, and artistic study. After her first year she was sent to a private art school in New York. She flourished in art and theory. Still able to live at home she spent her weekends working in Dragon Moon, constantly watching her mother work, Morgan learned a few things, first how to take care of people, and sterilize needles and the wounds created from the tats and piercings. She was allowed to prep clients but not much more then that, her mother fearing she was still to young. Her third year of middle school brought several changes for Morgan. She was passing through puberty, and gave up the frilly bright, fields and cherries type or painting, and art, turning towards the darker side of expression. Her resentment of her mothers and fathers extreme hatred, yet oiverwhemlinbg passion for one another began to rub off, she became violent acting out more, but mostly towards herself, as if she was punishing herself for being born and giving them something to fight over. For she knew as they told her over and over if it was not for her they would not be together, but her father being the good italian man he was couldnt let a child be born out of wed lock. As she turned 13 and was in her last yr of middle school her father was less and less involved with Morgan, he was gaining more power with the Don of the city and was not home much. He did however force her to continue running, and to work out with a personal trainer three times a week. As she entered into highschool she stayed atthe private school, her grades suffering as she spent so much time working with her mother. Her designs were being used now, gaining her some attention for her work. Morgan felt better then most people, using that throwing it in their faces and if they got on her, which they did she would physically show them she was not going to listen to them. She became more and more violent almost getting tossed out of the school for throwing a chair at a fellow classmate. As she entered into 10th grade her father saw her agression and felt he could put it to use. So against her mothers wishes Morgan began to work with Antontio the son of the Don that her father was working with. Antontio being some twenty years older then her and married. Her father felt his 'little girl' was safe with him.<br/>&amp;BGTHREE bg object=Morgan began in that summer by staying with Antontio's family, working at Dragon moon on the weekends. Antontio first taught her more about self defense helping her work on her agility and stamina. for the first two months of that summer all was well, though Morgan was developing a strong crush on this man, he knew it and did nothing to curb it, he flirted right back. She found a fondness for this whip she was givin, Antonio had not meant for her to learn to use it but since she handled it so well, her tall boyishly thin body and nimble strong hands make it east for her to learn to use it. She was playing one night and hit him with it, then again and again, something snapped in her and she really wanted to hurt him and tried, he became enraged and grabbed her she freaked out as he tied her done and raped her several times, violently, cutting her whipping her showing her she'd better not try and hurt him again. For the restof the summer he taught her a differnt type of skill, the art of torture and mostly through example she learned, things such as the pressure points and how to manipulate them, how to make people talk, binding, gagging them, she also, only because he'd never let her go if she didn't, learned how to escape from being bound. She would then try to make ways that she didn't know to get out of then attempt to. She would push Antontio, as far as she could, she wanted him to hurt her, part of her enjoyed the abuse, the sex, the violence, and part of her was terrified, feeling ashamed and fearful of what was happening to her inside. She was beginning to warp inside, the outside showwing in her art, her designs became morbidly expressive, much to her mothers delight, she though Antontio was good for her creativity, if she only knew. She went home after that summer and attemtped to returned for her next year of school, she didn't see antonio much for a while, spending more time with her mother learning more about tat's and pericing, and was allowed to preform simple one color tatto's and nose, and ear peircings at that time. Her own designs much mor inctricate she was not allowed to do as of yet. She garned some attention for the work she was doing, but more for her designs at that point then for her actual artwork.<br/>&amp;BGFOUR bg object=During xmas break of that year her parents wanted to go on vacation as they felt it migh help their marriage to get away. Leaving Darkfire in the care of Antontio and his family. Using that time Darkfire and Antonio spent most of the time in bed abusing each other. He almost killed her trying to show her the pleasures of haivng three quarters of the oxygen cut off. Passing out saved her life. She was angry, she thought he tried to kill her and lashed out at him in a nonseuxal viscious way, he overpowered her and beat her up good. She was docile for the rest of the week recoiling into herelf away from Antonio. The bruises not quite gone when her parents returned she was forced into explaining exactly what she had been learing from Antonio. Her mother called her a whore, her father was homicidal Morgan full of shame yet deeply in love with Antonio lashed out at her family, tearing the house apart before collapsing in tears in her mothers arms. She felt like she was slipping, slipping away, she loved her parents, yet hated them, and loved antontio yet....hated him for what he was doing, the lines between it all began to blur, she was not acting on reason anymore only instinct as she snuck out of her house and went to Antonio's apt. with the eyes of a child and the intent ofa demon she asked to dom him, to show him what she had been learning from him, the ways around the human body, how to abuse, and pleasure. He thinking she was finally beginning to grow up and understand agreed. She tied him up, daring him to escape, he couldn't she began to whip him, then harder, actually hurting him, her rage, she was lost. After causing him serious bodily injury she fucked him, then was about the let him go when he said, I am going to kill you when you untie me, she froze, totally stopped, not even breathing, she could feel he was serious, she knew him, she could sense it. And in a split second she advanced on him, strnagling him as he had done to her, except she never stopped, until he was gone. falling back she she sat there till almost dawn. Untying him, she went and got a razor slitting his throat letting his blood drain, she cleaned up after herself, using the knowledge he had told her about how to do this and left, calm, yet a swirling monster on the inside.<br/>&amp;BGFIVE bg object=This no one finding out thing didn't quite work. Within a day antontio' father knew, and he apparently knew all along what was happening with df and antonio. He found Morgan in her room, and beat her up almost to the point of death then reconsidered. Instead he forced her to watch and participate in the murder of her parents. Brutally visciously she almost liked it, the rush, the power. Until the guilt. By law she got everything, he house, Dragon Moon, the cars, the inheritance, money from her mothers career as an actress, everything. She has come here to reopen Dragon Moon, hoping to put everything that has happened to her in the past, behind her, hoping the past will remain the past and she can get on with her life.<br/>&amp;BGSIX bg object=So there I sat downing beer after beer pondering where my next meal was gonna come from and why I had been so mean to the only ones who took enough pity on me to feed me. A man came in, one I had never seen before, and probably never will again. He touched my hair, they always do...always the hair. I played the part, be nice, look cute maybe he is kindred, I thought maybe he can feed me. He touched my face, with wet fingers. I was curious for all of ten minutes until I felt the drugs hit my system. I felt good, but my goal, was always present. He asked what I did, then wanted a tattoo of a serpent on his back. I took him home and set about working on the art. I seemed like it took forever, they drugs wraping my reality slightly. Once I was done, I was stalling, trying to make excuses to get him to stay. As I pondered the same thing he asked, like so often they do, Are you kindred, something about my auras always makes them ask. I laughed in his face not sure if he was for real. Offended at my laughter, the next thing I felt was the slice of his tongue against my cheek. I knew then. I stopped laughing then he started, I explained I was not kindred and he asked why, I told him I really didn't know, except people wanted slaves, and I could play that part. He told me, that there was something more to serve then just some idiot trapped into the Camarilla. My attention quite peaked as I never truly felt all of their laws and traditions were for me. Well they never accepted me anyhow. I mean no one knew I couldn't really be their thrall, but still they were so damned snotty, I hated that...He went on and on about how I could make a temple for all of Set's children, his voice almost hyptnotizing the soft hiss and ever present smirk, lulled me almost to sleep. The history of the clan he went on and on about, I had heard before bits and pieces about the old ones and what had happened to Set, but nothing in as much detail. Growing bored my attention waning, rudly I asked him to feed me. He laughed, sounded almost like that guy from the seven-up comericals. My turn to be offended, but I presisted. He told me he had been watching me, for a long time. Started telling me about my life, and he even knew about the fact I could never be bound to him or anyone. He said it was time I grew up and realized my final destiny was not to be an arrogant art fag's ghoul, but to serve set and to turn this city into a stronghold for the clan, and for Set. Not quite sure what he was saying, I just did one of those blond nodding and possibly pretending to understand things. Before I finished the nod he was upon me. Not a word, no warning as he began to drain my blood. I thought oh god this is it, I fought so hard to stay alive and now he is going to kill me...I should have resisted. The thought wavered as I slipped from consciousness, only to be awakened by a dull sensation of blood dripping into my mouth, his blood. Shocked and dreadfully hungry, a hunger like I could have never imagined, yet he stopped me. And pushed me away. He said to me no more nights of stealing blood from vampires, now hunting for myself, alone. He impressed the importance of staying hidden and never tell anyone I was embraced, until it is too late, how would they know he said, you have been in midst for so long. Before he left he said once more always mind my goal, and live my unlife to undermine the camarilla and to serve set. He left a number, and a name, only a first name, Cahlie. He told me to get word to him if I need him, or if anything happens important. Then he was gone...<br/>@set bg object=DARK<br/><br/><br/>@create influence object=10<br/>@lock influence object=*Taffy<br/>&amp;SET_INFLUENCE influence object=$!clout *,*=*:@switch

She promises to be a true beauty when she ages, though.Already she's tall, about 5 and a half feet, and the structure of her bones indicates her willow-thin frame will always be just that.%r%tHer blond hair has been sun-bleached to almost white in spots. She wears it cut rather shaggily, about shoulder length.Her face is tanned slightly, with the red of sunburn brushed across her cheeks and the tip of her nose. Her eyes are a brilliant blue.%r%tHer clothes are simple; an old t-shirt which appears to be a couple sizes too large for her, a pair of jeans, and worn out sneakers on her feet.%r%tThe observant might notice the lines of 3 or 4 scars cutting like hatch marks across each of her wrists.%r<br/>&amp;DESC_FAE me=%r%tIn her fae seeming, she looks older than as a human...definitely a wilder, and one who has been such for a while.She is tall, reaching 6 feet, and willow thin, almost delicate in appearance. Don't let it fool you, though...her back is straight with confidence and strength.%r%tHer hair is a pale blond, almost white. It's cut to hang to about shoulder length, and looks a bit shaggy. Her skin is milk-pale and smooth.Fine, high cheekbones sweep up into eyes which are slightly almond-shaped. Her eyes are intense, a dark cobalt blue, framed by the delicate arch of pale brows. The points of her ears poke out from beneath her hair...here is beauty to break the heart.%r%tHer clothes are simple...no frequent visitor to courts is she. A grey linen tunic falls down over grey leggings, short suede boots on her feet. She has no jewelry, no ornaments or finery, only a sword in a leather scabbard, scraped and tired from years of use. The sword itself...at least what's visible...is a little off-color for steel.%r%tStrips of white cloth are wrapped around each of her wrists and reach from there across each palm, rather like bandages. She carries with her an air of sadness or melancholy...it seems that perhaps she's never smiled.<br/>@Aconnect me=@mail; @doing Victims...aren't we all.<br/>&amp;TOTCONNED me=35689<br/>&amp;XPCONNED me=35689<br/>@Mailcurf me=0<br/>@set me/Mailcurf = no_command<br/>@Adesc me=@pemit me=%n looked at you.<br/>&amp;LANGS_MAX me=1<br/>&amp;LANGS_REMAIN me=0<br/>&amp;KNOWN_LANGS me=Gaelic<br/>&amp;LAST_BUNK_DATE me=838963691<br/>&amp;ARTS_LIST me=Chicanery 1 | Chicanery 2 | Chicanery 3 | Chicanery 4 |     Wayfare 1 | Wayfare 2 |<br/>&amp;CURRENT_BUNKS me=1 11 6 77 81<br/>&amp;REALMS_LIST me=Actor 1 | Actor 2 | Actor 3 | Fae 1 | Fae 2 | Fae 3 | Fae 4 | Fae 5 |   <br/>&amp;DRAWN_BUNKS me= 10<br/>@set me=ANSI<br/>@set me=UNFINDABLE<br/>@set me=ENTER_OK<br/>@chzone me=Changeling Globals Object &lt;CG&gt;<br/>@open Stairs Down &lt;SD&gt;;sd;down;d;out;o;exit;leave<br/>@Desc Stairs Down &lt;SD&gt;=A heavy oaken door.

As you glance around, you can see that this vessel has been outfitted for just about everything a charter service could need. Pylons have been welded to the stern to support deep-sea fishing rods, a wooden-slat platform hangs aft for depositing and recovering divers, and a telescope is mounted on either side - though currently stowed - for catching the stray dolphin or even a whale. Looking up, a raised platform and canopy houses the vessel's controls, and as you look towards the bow, you can see the inside of the Fair Maiden's cabin. Though you can't see all of the details, it appears to be nicely-decorated and includes several sets of comfortable seats and a semi-stocked bar. Now if you'll all just take your seats, we'll get under way.<br/>@Desc Fair Maiden=You see before you the Fair Maiden, the one and only boat of Exotic Coast Charters. Its white hull almost gleams, though you can tell from the trim patterns that it might be more than a few years old. Wooden trim is placed in strategic locations along the hull and main cabin, and makes the vessel look quite comfortable. Along the stern you can make out pylons for fishing rods and a platform for diver revoery, as well as a raised wheelhouse standing high above it all.<br/>@set Fair Maiden=QUIET<br/>@set Fair Maiden=AUDIBLE<br/>@set Fair Maiden=ENTER_OK<br/>@set Fair Maiden=MYOPIC<br/>@set Fair Maiden=TRANSPARENT<br/>@parent Fair Maiden=Boat Parent<br/><br/>
