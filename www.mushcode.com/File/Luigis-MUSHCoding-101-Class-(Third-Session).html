Most of<br/>it has been left in its original state, though some parts of the log were<br/>edited to remove spam or correct a speaker's typo. A '*' has been placed in<br/>front of the speaker's name.<br/><br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Luigi's Classroom<br/>..is a pit. @Dolists and iter()'s float about, encapsulating each other, and<br/>surrounding and being surrounded by a plethora of other functions and @commands.<br/>It's a mess. Some of the code here is scribbled on walls and notebook paper, while<br/>even more of it is written on the windows with crayons or scratched into the floors.<br/>Madness. You wonder how you'll ever learn how to code now.<br/>Contents:<br/>Faizah's Plant H/W to Luigi<br/>Planted Seed<br/>Rhayden<br/>Xeiran<br/>Mapping Droid<br/>Faizah<br/>Note<br/>Blackboard<br/>Obvious exits:<br/>&lt;O&gt;ut<br/>Phil_Laco fire spitball at Faizah's forehead.<br/>Phil_Laco has left.<br/>Xeiran says, "I sure wish I could have made my frame one..."<br/>Xeiran says, "Um, Luigi, how do you make animations?"<br/>* Luigi says,, "Alright, is everyone ready to begin?"<br/>Faizah says, "Hang on. Want to show all 3 stages of my plant."<br/>drop h/w<br/>Dropped.<br/>l h/w<br/>Faizah's Plant H/W to Luigi(#6173V)<br/>     You see a small plant, growing out of a clay pot.

It grows to be gigantic!<br/>Faizah says, "This is the small one."<br/>Xeiran digs back up the tree seed.<br/>Faizah waters the plant, and it grows a little.<br/>l h/w<br/>Faizah's Plant H/W to Luigi(#6173V)<br/>     The plant is precisely 1 meter tall. It looks to be a small tree of some kind. <br/>                         <br/>        ±±               <br/>       ± ±±              <br/>          ±   ±±±        <br/>             ±±  ±       <br/>             ±           <br/>         ±±±±±±          <br/>          ±±±±           <br/>          ±±±±           <br/>          ±±±±           <br/><br/>     You may like to water it to make it grow.<br/>Faizah says, "The 1-meter one."<br/>Faizah waters the plant, and it grows a little.<br/>Xeiran says, "This is what it shows when you dig up the redwood :) "You grab a shovel<br/>and dig at the redwood's base, finally crouching down, and coming up triumphantly with<br/>the seed, grinning at no one in particular. Meanwhile, the redwood topples over and<br/>smashes some old lady in a wheelchair. Oops.""<br/>Faizah says, "The adult one"<br/>Phil_Laco has left.<br/>Faizah says, "That's my tree thing. Heh."<br/>* Luigi says,, "Good job."<br/>Xeiran says, "Heheh"<br/>Faizah says, "Not much, but I like the descs."<br/>Rhayden's plant had pictures<br/>Xeiran says, "I think mine would have gotten a pretty good rating, if my picture hadn't<br/>screwed up"<br/>* Luigi says,, "I'll grade them later. Can we begin?"<br/>Xeiran says, "Yes, let's go"<br/>Faizah says, "I'm ready"<br/>Rhayden says, "Time to learn"<br/>* Luigi says,, "The first week we discussed Commands and Functions. Such as @create,<br/>add(), and so forth. We also talked about $-commands, or user-defined commands, the<br/>format being &amp;&lt;attribute&gt; &lt;object&gt;=$&lt;command&gt;:&lt;what to do when this command is typed&gt;."<br/>* Luigi says,, "The second week we discussed @Wipe, @Destroy, and most importantly,<br/>@Switch."<br/>* Luigi says,, "We also discussed @Listen and @Ahear."<br/>* Luigi says,, "For review, @Switch uses the following format:"<br/>Faizah grins.
