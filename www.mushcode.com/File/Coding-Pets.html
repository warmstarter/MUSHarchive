        Topic: Coding Pets<br/>Author: Stoko<br/>Summary: Stoko walks through the creation of a pet, progressing from basic<br/>commands through more complex commands.<br/><br/>"Coding Pets", held by Stoko@M*U*S*H at 16th October 2002 in RedHat Hall.<br/>Logged by Zebranky@M*U*S*H<br/><br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "hello, fellow M*U*S*H'ers. The lecture starts."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "everyone, read -help lecture and -help lecture2 if you<br/>haven't yet."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "let's start with coding a basic pet, which can only do<br/>SIT, STAY, SPEAK, ROLLOVER and BEG."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "first, we will create an object which will be our pet.<br/>@create &lt;pet's name&gt;."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "then, we will put the custom commands on him."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "&amp;command_sit &lt;pet's dbref&gt;=$sit:@emit &lt;the text which<br/>should be displayed to describe the pet's action of sitting&gt;"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "&amp;command_stay &lt;pet's dbref&gt;=$stay:@emit &lt;the text<br/>which should be displayed to describe the pet's action of staying&gt;"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "et cetera. We do the same thing for the remaining<br/>three commands. &amp;command_&lt;the name of the command&gt; &lt;pet's dbref&gt;=$&lt;the name of<br/>the command&gt;:@emit &lt;the text that should be displayed to everyone in the room<br/>when someone types that command&gt;"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "so, whenever we type the text between $ and :,<br/>everyone in the room will be displayed the text after @emit"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "the next step is unsetting the NO_COMMAND flag on the<br/>pet"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "NO_COMMAND is put on every newly created object, and<br/>it needs to be reset in order to enable the object (our pet, in this case), to<br/>respond to commands that are programmed on it."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "we reset it with @set &lt;pet's dbref&gt;=!no_command"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "next, we @describe our pet with @desc &lt;pet's<br/>dbref&gt;=Pet's description."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "and the major part of the work for the basic pet is<br/>done and we only need to make several finishing touches"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "first, the owner may disable everyone except him to<br/>pick the pet up"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "it's done with @lock &lt;pet's dbref&gt;=me"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "also, the owner can disable everyone except him to use<br/>the commands stored in the pet's attributes."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "he does so by typing @ulock &lt;pet's dbref&gt;=me"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "and that's it, regarding the begginer pets."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "any questions before we move to intermediate pets?"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko pouts at the sleeping audience.<br/>You say, "I have a question. Are there cocktail shrimp after the show?"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko lies to keep Zebranky here, "Yes."<br/>You say, "YAY!"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "so, now I'll talk about coding the intermediate pets."<br/>Zebranky cant read, and sees that as 'Stoko likes to keep Zebranky here'<br/>banana would like some shrimp as well!<br/>China says, "if sir, we use the commands simply as 'sit' 'stay' etc, will that<br/>trigger all the other pets to do thier tricks too at the same time?"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "it will, unless they are @ulocked or in the<br/>inventories of their owners."<br/>China nodnods.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "also, some of the pets don't have their commands<br/>triggered by 'sit', 'speak', etc. Those pets are the advanced ones, because<br/>for the advanced pets all the commands are spoken and not typed."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko greets the newcomer, "Take a seat, colleague."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "okay, now about the intermediate pets."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "for intermediate pets, one of the basic commands (sit,<br/>speak, stay, rollover, beg) has to be spoken"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "those commands start with ^ instead of $"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "and are given to the object (or pet) not by typing,<br/>but with speaking ('say sit' - Stoko says, "sit"), for instance."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "for the SIT command, we will make this code:<br/>&amp;command_sit &lt;pet's dbref&gt;=^* says, "Sit":@emit &lt;the text that will be<br/>displayed to everyone in the room&gt;"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "the MONITOR flag has to be set on the pet with the<br/>^-command. Otherwise, it won't react to such commands at all."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "@set &lt;pet's dbref&gt;=monitor"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "that covers the spoken commands."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "before we move to the advanced pets, I'll explain how<br/>to code the FETCH and the COME command. FETCH will be first to be explained."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "we have to create an object which the pet will fetch.<br/>@create &lt;the fetch-object's name&gt;"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "I have seen several variations of the FETCH command,<br/>one of it is the searching of an object in the entire MUSH, passing several<br/>exits, getting the object, and returning back to the master again,..."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "and second was fetching an object on the adjacent<br/>location"<br/>Farside raises hand.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko sighs, perspirates and lights a cigarrette, apologizing, and<br/>thinking frantically about the ways how to code this command, "Just give me a<br/>moment, please."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "yes?"<br/>Farside says, "Wait, nevermind. Sorry."<br/>Farside returns to his seat.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko shrugs and takes a few inhalations of the cigarette's smoke.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "for instance, we could, for our commotion, code a<br/>fetch object which has a 'throw' command on it."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "the 'throw' command will cause the object to leave<br/>your inventory and enter an adjacent location with 'go &lt;exit's name&gt;'. the<br/>syntax will be 'throw &lt;exit's name&gt;'"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "we already created the fetch object, and now we'll<br/>first unset the no_command flag."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "we'll type: &amp;throw &lt;fetch object's dbref&gt;=$throw<br/>*:@force me=leave;@emit Stoko throws the [name(me)].;go %0 . This is a simple,<br/>sloppy, version of the code for 'throw', but it will work if the exit's name<br/>is typed correctly."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "next, we'll code the spoken fetch command on the pet."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "it could be triggered by typing: say &lt;pet's name&gt;,<br/>fetch &lt;fetch object's name&gt;"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "it's good to put the '&lt;pet's name&gt;,' part in the<br/>spoken commands because, otherwise, commands could be triggered by<br/>accidentally saying the command word in a conversation or by some other<br/>petmaster's command to his own pet."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "but this percaution isn't necessary to avoid the<br/>latter case if the pet is @ulocked to you."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko ponders a little.<br/>Letters is late. :/<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko writes some code on the blackboard, and says, "It's halfway<br/>written."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko finishes the code, wiping perspiration from his forehead,<br/>"&amp;command_fetch &lt;pet's dbref&gt;=^* says, "&lt;pet's name&gt;, fetch &lt;fetch object's<br/>name&gt;":@force me=go<br/>[setq(0,loc(me)][iter(lexits(here),switch(1,gt(match(lcon(loc(##)),&lt;fetch<br/>object's dbref&gt;),0),##),%b,{});get &lt;fetch object's dbref&gt;;go<br/>iter(lexits(here),switch(%q0,loc(##),##),%b,{})"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "this is the code for the fetch command."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "I'll explain what it does."<br/>China drops her jaw.<br/>Farside raises hand.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "farside?"<br/>Letters drops his jaw too...<br/>Farside says, "In your first function, setq, you have a parenthesis error."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "true. thank you, Farside."<br/>Farside says, "No problem."<br/>Farside sits back down.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko adds a bracket to the code on the blackboard. The code is now<br/>like this:<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; &amp;command_fetch &lt;pet's dbref&gt;=^* says, "&lt;pet's name&gt;, fetch &lt;fetch<br/>object's name&gt;":@force me=go<br/>[setq(0,loc(me)][iter(lexits(here),switch(1,gt(match(lcon(loc(##)),&lt;fetch<br/>object's dbref&gt;),0),##),%b,{});get &lt;fetch object's dbref&gt;;go<br/>iter(lexits(here),switch(%q0,loc(##),##),%b,{})<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "sorry."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; &amp;command_fetch &lt;pet's dbref&gt;=^* says, "&lt;pet's name&gt;, fetch &lt;fetch<br/>object's name&gt;":@force me=go<br/>[setq(0,loc(me))][iter(lexits(here),switch(1,gt(match(lcon(loc(##)),&lt;fetch<br/>object's dbref&gt;),0),##),%b,{});get &lt;fetch object's dbref&gt;;go<br/>iter(lexits(here),switch(%q0,loc(##),##),%b,{})<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "there."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "so, the explanation."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "the setq part sets the dbref of the starting location<br/>to a local variable, %q0, because it will be useful later, to returning to the<br/>starting point."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "another error."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko adds a square bracket to the code.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; &amp;command_fetch &lt;pet's dbref&gt;=^* says, "&lt;pet's name&gt;, fetch &lt;fetch<br/>object's name&gt;":@force me=go<br/>[setq(0,loc(me))][iter(lexits(here),switch(1,gt(match(lcon(loc(##)),&lt;fetch<br/>object's dbref&gt;),0),##),%b,{})];get &lt;fetch object's dbref&gt;;go<br/>iter(lexits(here),switch(%q0,loc(##),##),%b,{})<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "I hadn't have closed the square bracket in front of<br/>first iter()"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko rolls another cigarette before continuing.<br/>Farside wonders why you did a switch(1,...<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "we'll come to that."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko lights the cigarette and says, "the first iter checks all the<br/>exits in the room to see in which of it's destinations is the fetch object. It<br/>checks that with switch() which returns the exit's dbref if it's destination<br/>contains the object we're looking for.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "so, the resulting command is 'go &lt;the dbref of the<br/>exit that leads to the location which contains the fetch object&gt;', and the<br/>result is that the pet leaves the room through that exit, arriving at the same<br/>place with the fetch object."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "now, to answer Farside's question."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "the second part of the switch is 0 if the dbref of the<br/>fetch object isn't among the contents of the location we are probing, and<br/>greater than zero otherwise."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko ponders, "Perhaps it puzzled you why I didn't simply use &gt;0<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "am I right?"<br/>Farside says, "Oh, I see. Backwards heh."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "the result is the same, but I've, wrongly, chosen the<br/>bulkier variation."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko ponders a little more and continues, "The next thing the pet<br/>does is 'get &lt;fetch object's dbref&gt;'. That part is clear<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "the last part of the code is returning to the starting<br/>location, to put the fetch object in front of the pet's master afterward. I<br/>forgot to put the last part in the code, but I will after I explain the<br/>returning to the starting location."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "the iter checks all the exits on the new location to<br/>see which one leads back to the starting room. The code recognizes the<br/>starting room by it's dbref which it stored in the local variable %q0"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "and the resulting code is 'go &lt;the dbref of the exit<br/>that leads to the starting location&gt;'"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko appends some code to the code on the blackboard.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; &amp;command_fetch &lt;pet's dbref&gt;=^* says, "&lt;pet's name&gt;, fetch &lt;fetch<br/>object's name&gt;":@force me=go<br/>[setq(0,loc(me))][iter(lexits(here),switch(1,gt(match(lcon(loc(##)),&lt;fetch<br/>object's dbref&gt;),0),##),%b,{})];get &lt;fetch object's dbref&gt;;go<br/>iter(lexits(here),switch(%q0,loc(##),##),%b,{});drop &lt;fetch object's dbref&gt;<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "the last command in the semicolon-separated queue is<br/>'drop &lt;fetch object's dbref&gt;"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "that's it, regarding the functional part of the FETCH.<br/>One can put some @emits in the code to make the thing look more pretty."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "feel free to queue your questions before we move to<br/>the COME command."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "no questions? all right."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "the COME command orders the pet to come to you from<br/>the adjacent location."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "we have to make a command object for otherwise the<br/>absent pet wouldn't know that we called it."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "@create &lt;command object's name - "&lt;pet's name&gt;'s<br/>command object" should be fine&gt;"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "we will store the spoken COME command onto the pet's<br/>command object."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "but, before that, we can code the spoken 'go' command<br/>which we will use to make the pet leave our location and get to the place from<br/>which we will call it."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "&amp;command_go &lt;pet's dbref&gt;=^* says, "&lt;pet's name&gt;, go<br/>*":go "<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "sorry.."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "&amp;command_go &lt;pet's dbref&gt;=^* says, "&lt;pet's name&gt;, go<br/>*":go %1"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "It took so long because I wanted to make a longer,<br/>less sloppy, error-proof, command, but I changed my mind."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "then we'll put the COME command on the command object"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "after typing @set &lt;command object's<br/>dbref&gt;=!no_command"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "and @setting the command object MONITOR"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko starts writing the code for COME on the blackboard.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; &amp;command come &lt;command object's dbref&gt;=^* says, "&lt;pet's name&gt;,<br/>come":@force &lt;pet's dbref&gt;=go iter(lexits(loc(&lt;pet's<br/>dbref&gt;)),switch(1,gt(match(lcon(loc(##)),&lt;pet owner's dbref&gt;),0),##),%b,{})<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko ponders over the code, making sure he got everything right.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "yeah, the code is good."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "so, we'll also @ulock the command object to ourselves<br/>with @ulock &lt;command object's dbref&gt;=me"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "and also lock it to ourselves so that none other may<br/>pick it up, with @lock &lt;command object's dbref&gt;=me"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "and we'll drop it before using the come command, and<br/>pick it up afterward."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "we use this spoken command with 'say &lt;pet's name&gt;,<br/>come"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "that covers the intermediate pets"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "any questions before we move to advanced ones?"<br/>China says, "is this 'command object' the Controller Thingy that Grinna wanted<br/>all the pets to have?"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "yeah."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "since it seems that no more questions will be asked,<br/>I'll start explaining how to code advanced pets."<br/>China says, "if it was never required before, why does she require it now?"<br/>China says, "oops, sorry."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "it's okay."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "I don't know. She's the person to ask about that, not<br/>me."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "not I, I mean."<br/>Farside says, "Can you teach us how to make pets that learn new tricks on<br/>command, and age, and die, and how to build obidience schools?"<br/>China nods. "just wondered. Thought it was something to do with how code<br/>works."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "in fact, even a basic pet could be coded to work with<br/>a controller"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "simply, you put the commands on the controller, and<br/>not on the pet, but the controller forces the pet to perform the commands."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "with @force."<br/>China ponders this.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "I can, Farside, teach you the first three things you<br/>mentioned, but I'm not certain what the obedience schools are."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "although, that digression would take too much time and<br/>would prevent me from explaining the crucial thing, from explaining how to<br/>code advanced pets."<br/>Farside says, "Alright. Just do what you were going to do. :-)"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "perhaps after I'm done with the advanced pets, if you<br/>really are interested."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko nods.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "while the novice level required only three basic<br/>commands which can be either $commands or spoken ones, and while the<br/>intermediate level required four basic tricks plus one intermediate command<br/>(FETCH or COME), requiring at least one of those five total commands to be a<br/>spoken one, the advanced level requires all the novice and intermediate tricks<br/>plus find, and all of those commands have to be spoken."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "I'll have to return to the intermediate level for a<br/>moment, though, because I forgot something."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "COME code again.."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; &amp;command come &lt;command object's dbref&gt;=^* says, "&lt;pet's name&gt;,<br/>come":@force &lt;pet's dbref&gt;=go iter(lexits(loc(&lt;pet's<br/>dbref&gt;)),switch(1,gt(match(lcon(loc(##)),&lt;pet owner's dbref&gt;),0),##),%b,{})<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko adds some text to the end of the code.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; &amp;command come &lt;command object's dbref&gt;=^* says, "&lt;pet's name&gt;,<br/>come":@force &lt;pet's dbref&gt;=go iter(lexits(loc(&lt;pet's<br/>dbref&gt;)),switch(1,gt(match(lcon(loc(##)),&lt;pet owner's<br/>dbref&gt;),0),##),%b,{});follow &lt;owner's dbref&gt;<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "I've added the 'follow' part.

Spooky."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "so, let's shed light on the AI by taking an exact<br/>purpose for the AI we want to make: making a code that will code a novice pet"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "first, we have created the pet, then we @described it,<br/>we've set it !no_command, @locked it and @ulocked it to ourselves."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "we'll set it MONITOR, too, because we'll code all the<br/>commands as spoken."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko ponderse.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko typos and ponders.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko takes out a sandwich and meditates while eating. You try to<br/>calculate the duration of this interruption, and conclude he'll be done with<br/>devouring the poor piece of bread and ham in, around, three minutes.<br/>China grins.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko finishes eating and throws, over his shoulder, the paper in<br/>which his meal was wrapped straight into the trash basket by the blackboard.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "We will code this in a cosmetically sloppy way."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "since I can't come up with something sufficiently<br/>acceptable."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "we'll make a spoken command for learning"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "to use it, we'll be typing this: say &lt;pet's name&gt;,<br/>when I say "*", everyone in the room will see: *"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "and the code will be like this:"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; &amp;command_learn &lt;pet's dbref&gt;=^* says, "&lt;pet's name&gt;, when I say<br/>"*", everyone in the room will see: *":@force me={@set me=%1:^* says, "&lt;pet's<br/>name&gt;, %2":@emit %3;pose intelligently nods to %N.}<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko will code such pet now.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko drops An Archetypal Pet.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko looks at the topic, puzzled, "It's blank"<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko goes down the few steps to the seating area.<br/>Stoko comes down the few steps from the stage.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko has left.<br/>Stoko has arrived.<br/>Stoko carefully walks up the narrow stairs to the stage.<br/>Stoko has left.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko has arrived.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; An Archetypal Pet is now listening.<br/>Farside furrows brow.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko finishes assembling the pet, putting only the single command<br/>on it.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "pet, when I say "sit", everyone in the room will see:<br/>The pet sits."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko gahs.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "lapsus..."<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko debugs<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; &amp;command_learn #4784=^* says, "Pet, when I say "*", everyone in the<br/>room will see - *":@force me={@set me=%1:^* says, "Pet, %2":@emit %3;pose<br/>intelligently nods to %N.}<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko debugs some more<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; &amp;command_learn #4784=^* says, "Pet, when I say "*", everyone in the<br/>room will see - *":@force me={@set me=command_%1:^* says, "Pet, %1":@emit<br/>%2;pose intelligently nods to %N.}<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; &amp;command_learn #4784=^* says, "Pet, when I say "*", everyone in the<br/>room will see - *":@force me={@set me=command_%1:^* says, "Pet, %1":@emit<br/>%2;pose intelligently nods to %N.}<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko oopses.<br/>&lt;Lecturer&gt; Stoko says, "sorry for repasting.

I apprecitate your doing the lecture and your<br/>willingness to do more of them. Thank you again."<br/>Stoko says, "you're welcome."<br/>China smiles and leaves now, before she begins to bore you. :)<br/>China enters Linux Lobby.<br/>China has left.<br/>Stoko has left.
