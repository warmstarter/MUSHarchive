And you're going around in these environments that<br/>have been crafted by those that came to that site before you. And you're ready<br/>to make a contribution to the environ, but don't have the foggiest how you're<br/>going to do it. So, you ask someone, and they point you to the ever-infamous<br/>cryptic help files for about a half-dozen commands, including but not limited<br/>to: @dig, @open, @link, @succ, @osucc, @odrop, @fail, @lock, @desc, and @idesc.<br/>	What IS all this gibberish, you ask? Well, I shall endeavour to teach<br/>you the beginner's guide to building on a MUSH. Will it teach you absolutely<br/>everything you could ever know? No. Will it teach you how to make rooms and<br/>exits that will conform to the building standards of most games, and allow you<br/>to impress your friends and neighbours with your building savvy? Yes.<br/><br/>PUTTING THE 'FUN' BACK IN FUNDAMENTALS<br/><br/>	There are four main types of objects on a MUSH. Player objects(your<br/>character, for instance), things(objects created with @create. More on this<br/>later), exits(the objects you use to get from one room to another), and<br/>rooms(the places you go to RP on a MUSH). All objects are best referenced by<br/>their dbref, which stands for database reference number. There is no more<br/>specific way to reference an object on a MUSH than by dbref. So, we shall<br/>endeavour to do that whenever possible, whether building or coding. In most<br/>cases, the dbref is easier to type because it's shorter, anyways. For most<br/>building purposes, you only need to work with rooms and exits. Some basic<br/>concepts on these:<br/><br/>Room - A room on a MUSH is identifiable because it has the R immediately after<br/>the dbref. Example: The Room(#1234RnJ) tells you that you are in a room named<br/>'The Room', its dbref is #1234, it's of the type ROOM, and has the flags<br/>'no_command and jump_ok'. A room can be thought of as a 'box'. It is something<br/>that can hold other objects inside of it. It can have most any name you can<br/>think of, and can have practically any description you want.<br/><br/>Exit - Exits on a MUSH are what connect rooms together. An exit is a ONE-WAY<br/>door. This is a very important concept that most people don't have when they<br/>start building. Exits are a lot like 'doors', yes. But, doors are a single<br/>object that let you go both ways. Not so with exits. Exits only provide a<br/>one-way connection between one room and another.<br/>	The best analogy I can make is that an exit is like a radio. It takes<br/>things from a source(radio waves in the air), and spits them out somewhere<br/>else(in the room). You can't talk to the clock radio(in most cases) by your<br/>bedside, and have people in the radio station hear you. You need something to<br/>transmit back. So it is with exits. You have to have an exit going from Room A<br/>to Room B, AND an exit going from Room B BACK to Room A if you want to mimic a<br/>'doorway'.<br/>	Another feature of exits is that they can have multiple aliases you can<br/>use to trigger their usage. This is evident in exits that are named Out &lt;O&gt;,<br/>for instance, where you can type 'out' or just 'o' and either one will take you<br/>through that exit. Exits are named with all their aliases in their name, so it<br/>looks something like: Out &lt;O&gt;;out;o;exit;leave. The ; in between each alias<br/>separates them into a list. Any of those options may be typed. You only ever<br/>see the /first/ name in the ;-separated list, in the list of exits in a room.<br/>This is why there is the convention of putting the 'Out &lt;O&gt;' as the first name<br/>there.<br/><br/>WERE YOU BORN IN A BARN? <br/><br/>	No, but we'll build one. A simple two-room barn that has a Barn, and a<br/>Hayloft. In doing so, we will learn about how rooms link together in a virtual<br/>environment, how to use exit messages to personalize your building, and what<br/>the various exit messages do.<br/>	To start with, we have to assume that you're standing in a room. All<br/>MUSHes have at least one. There is one and only one command to create a room,<br/>but there are several variations on how it can be used. Most people use one of<br/>three ways, and I shall list them here for their educational value:<br/><br/>	1) @dig Barn<br/>	2) @dig/tel Barn<br/>	3) @dig Barn=Barn &lt;B&gt;;barn;b,Out &lt;O&gt;;out;o;exit;leave<br/><br/>	You'll notice that all three of these start with @dig. This is because<br/>@dig is the command to create a room. You are literally 'digging' into the<br/>virtual stuff that makes a MUSH, and carving out the shape of your box. In all<br/>three cases, the one thing that is guaranteed to happen is that you will create<br/>a room named 'Barn'. This room will be assigned a dbref. You'll see this dbref<br/>when it's assigned, because you will be given a message that looks like:<br/><br/>Room 'Barn' created with dbref #100.<br/><br/>For the sake of our hypothetical barn, let's say that this Barn was given the<br/>dbref #100.<br/><br/>	Let's look at the differences between the three. The first version will<br/>create the room and nothing more. There will be a room, unconnected to<br/>anything, floating out in the etherspace, waiting for you. The second version<br/>will first dig the room, and then @teleport you into it. You can teleport into<br/>any room you own. The point in teleporting you into the room is so that you can<br/>do your work from within the room, rather than outside of it. @dig/tel is used<br/>in @decompiles of MUSH building.<br/>	The last version of the command is more complicated, but in my woefully<br/>unhumble opinion, the most useful. This version does three things, all in one<br/>line. It digs the room for you. It then opens an exit from where you are(the<br/>room you are currently in) TO the new room. And, it opens an exit back from<br/>your brand new room to where you are. In one command, you've taken care of<br/>building your room, and exits in and out of it!<br/>	Because we will be needing some other methods to make our barn,<br/>we'll discuss how to create exits by themselves. The basic command to do<br/>this is @open, and it too has two variations.<br/><br/>AN @OPEN AND SHUT CASE<br/><br/>	The @open command does just that. It 'opens' an exit from one location<br/>to another location. As was pointed out above, when you create or name an exit,<br/>you can give it multiple aliases that let you have a variety of commands to<br/>type that utilize the exit. The most basic way to open an exit is:<br/><br/>	@open Exit Name;alias1;alias2;...;aliasN=#dbref<br/><br/>	This opens an exit from the room you are in to the target specified by<br/>the dbref. You can't use the name of the room, because if you are in one room<br/>you cannot technically 'see' another room. You must use the dbref to open an<br/>exit.<br/>	There is a slightly more advanced version of @open that works similarly<br/>to what we witnessed above in the #3 version of @dig. Its syntax is:<br/><br/>	@open Exit Name;alias1;alias2;alias3;...;aliasN=#dbref,Exit<br/>Back;alias1;alias2;alias3;...;aliasN<br/><br/>	Yes, this version does the same thing as the long version of @dig, with<br/>the exception that it doesn't create the room. This simply makes the two-way<br/>path between the room you are in and the target room, specified by dbref. The<br/>first exit(before the =) is the exit TO the next room. The last exit(after the<br/>#dbref,) is the exit BACK to the room in which you are currently standing.<br/><br/>RAISING THE ROOF<br/><br/>	Alright, so let's start with our barn. I'm going to use the long<br/>version of the @dig command, because to me, it saves time. There's no need to<br/>match up dbrefs in @open. Some basic rules before you begin any building<br/>project:<br/>- You have to have permission to build! Some games restrict building. Read the<br/>posted news files and bulletin boards to see if this is the case.<br/><br/>- You have to be able to link exits to and from the room you're in. If you<br/>don't have permission to do this, find out if your game has a 'Building Zone'<br/>where such privileges are okay. A room set with the LINK_OK flag can have exits<br/>linked to it.<br/><br/>- You have to know what you're building! This sounds somewhat silly, but many<br/>people skip this step, which leads to a number of errors later. Take two<br/>minutes and sketch out the rough 'map' of what you're going to build on a piece<br/>of paper. That way, you can see the spatial relationships better, and plan out<br/>what exits are needed.<br/><br/>- You have to have enough pennies to build. In general, rooms cost ten pennies<br/>to @dig, exits cost 1 penny to open and 1 penny to link. So, to make one room<br/>with an exit going in and out takes 14 pennies. A number of games have quotas<br/>as well. See how much quota you have, and try and design a building project<br/>that can be accomodated in that.<br/><br/>	All those rules aside, let's build. We'll assume you have sufficient<br/>quota, money, and privileges, and that you are in room #99. Now, we'll get<br/>started. Our first command:<br/><br/>@dig Barn=Barn &lt;B&gt;;barn;b,Out of the Barn &lt;O&gt;;out;o;exit;leave;out of the barn<br/><br/>	This creates a room named Barn. Again, we'll say it's #100. It also<br/>creates two exits. One of them is #101(the exit named Barn &lt;B&gt;), the other is<br/>#102(Out). These are numbered in order, taking up the next two available<br/>numbers in your db. They will not /always/ be sequential, but more often than<br/>not, they will. It's a good idea when building to keep a little scratch pad<br/>nearby, for marking down dbref numbers to remember while you build. <br/>	This is important especially if you are a mortal(non-Wizard,<br/>non-Royalty), because it costs 100 pennies on most games to use @search or<br/>@find, and that eliminates 7 rooms and 14 exits from your possible building<br/>project!<br/>	Alright, so we have a room and two exits. The first thing we want to do<br/>is put the messages on our exit going INTO the barn. There are four messages<br/>that are considered 'standard' to put on /every/ exit you make. These are the<br/>@desc, @succ, @osucc, and @odrop messages. These confuse a lot of people, so I<br/>will outline them here with what I hope are easy to understand definitions:<br/><br/>@desc - Description. Short for @describe. What you see when you 'look' at<br/>something. Exits are like the other three types of objects(Room, Thing,<br/>Player), in that you can look at them. Try typing 'look barn'. You'll get: You<br/>see nothing special. This is the default MU* message for something having no<br/>description.<br/><br/>@succ - Short for @success. This is the message seen when a player<br/>successfully(hence the name) goes through the exit. It is seen /by/ the player<br/>going through the exit. So, if you put an @succ message on your Barn &lt;B&gt; exit,<br/>and then go through the exit, YOU see the message. An example is: <br/>@succ barn=You pass through the door, and enter the barn. <br/>	And if you go in through the barn exit(by typing 'barn', or 'b'), you<br/>will see: You pass through the door, and enter the barn.<br/><br/>@osucc - Short for @osuccess. Any MUSH command that begins with @o means that<br/>it is a message (O)ther people will see when something happens. And it's a<br/>'succ' messages, meaning it is shown when something successfully happens. In<br/>this case, it is you going through the exit. Also, any MUSH command that begins<br/>with @o means that the name of the object that triggered the message will be<br/>put in front of it. That cannot be helped. The MUSH is coded to do it that way,<br/>and has been so for about a dozen years. This will happen every time. All you<br/>have to provide is what will be shown /after/ the object's name. <br/>	Now, some small bit of talk needs to be given to which other people<br/>will see this message. Exits have a source(called its 'home') and a<br/>destination(called its 'location'). The home is where it is going from, and its<br/>location is where it is going to. You 'use' the exit in its home, at its<br/>source. So, other people in the same room as the home, or source, of the exit<br/>are the ones that are going to see it. For example:<br/>@osucc barn=enters the barn.<br/>	Then, in room #99 where you started, your friend Bubba is standing<br/>there. Bubba decides to go into the barn. <br/>Bubba types: barn<br/>Bubba sees: You pass through the door, and enter the barn. (the @succ message)<br/>You see: Bubba enters the barn.<br/><br/>@odrop - Not short for anything. Again, we have an @o message, which means a)<br/>it is a message that (o)ther people will see and b) it will have the object's<br/>name that triggered it, put in front of whatever you set the message to be. Why<br/>is it called 'drop', you ask? Because technically, when you go through an exit,<br/>it is 'dropping' you in a new location. This is the same as if you pick up a<br/>Book in Room #99 and @teleport yourself to room #100(your Barn) and type 'drop<br/>book'. It is the best way to describe what the exit does. It drops you in the<br/>next room, its location. Because of this, the 'o' in the odrop means that<br/>(o)ther people in the destination of the exit are going to see the message. Not<br/>the people at the source. They see the osucc. People in the destination room<br/>see the odrop. Here's an example:<br/>@odrop barn=comes through the door, into the barn.<br/>	So, hypothetically, Bubba is back in Room #99 with you. Jethro is in<br/>the Barn, waiting on Bubba.<br/><br/>Bubba types: barn<br/>Bubba sees: You pass through the door, and enter the barn. (the @succ message)<br/>You see: Bubba enters the barn. 			   (the @osucc message)<br/>Jethro sees: Bubba comes through the door, into the barn.  (the @odrop message)<br/><br/>	The description on the exit is usually just that, a description of<br/>whatever passage the exit represents. If it is a hallway, it should be<br/>described as a hallway. If it is a door, then it should be described such.<br/>Something else that can be done is to set an exit with the TRANSPARENT flag,<br/>which lets you see the description in the room beyond when you look at the<br/>exit. Please note that even with the TRANSPARENT flag set, if you look at an<br/>exit that does not have an @desc, you will still see 'You see nothing special.'<br/>before you see the desc of the room beyond.<br/>	For our barn door, I would suggest something like:<br/>@desc barn=This is a sturdy wooden door that slides to the right to admit<br/>entrance to the big, red barn.<br/>	If you've done all the messages I've outline here, you've got your<br/>first exit done, and you're ready to go into the Barn itself. Type 'barn', and<br/>go in. You won't see much. You'll see:<br/><br/>Barn(#100R)<br/><br/>Obvious exits<br/>Out &lt;O&gt;<br/><br/>	From this point, you have two responsibilities. You have to describe<br/>your room, and you have to message your out exit. Let's take care of the exit<br/>first, as that's easiest to forget about, if you leave it too long. A room with<br/>no desc tends to attract your attention more than an exit with no odrop.<br/>	This is the exit that will be used to exit your barn, so I would<br/>suggest putting messages on it that reflect this. Here are some suggestions:<br/>@desc out=This is the inside of the sturdy wooden door that slides to one side,<br/>allowing passage in and out of the barn.<br/>@succ out=With a rumble as it moves on the rails, you slide the door to one<br/>side, and exit the barn.<br/>@osucc out=slides the big barn door to one side and exits.<br/>@odrop out=comes out of the barn.<br/><br/>	As a general rule, it is helpful to provide a reference in the osucc<br/>and odrop messages to let the people seeing them know where the person was<br/>coming from. If there are four doors into a room, and the odrop reads 'comes<br/>into the room.' then you don't know from which room they entered!<br/>	Similarly, unless it's for a specific effect, an osucc and odrop that<br/>are four or five lines long becomes spammy to those who might be seeing four or<br/>five people come through an exit at once. However, I /do/ recommend putting<br/>some descriptive messages in your @succ messages. While some players might<br/>scoff and say they never read those things, I personally feel that they are a<br/>very effective way of developing a roleplay-like interaction between you and<br/>your environment. The @succ can provide some really interesting information to<br/>the user, should you choose to put it in.<br/><br/>A DESC JOB<br/><br/>	Describing a room is regarded by some as an art form, some as the<br/>equivalent of hard labor, and even others as an exact science. The same command<br/>used to describe your character, an exit, or an object, is used to describe a<br/>room. @desc here=&lt;your description here&gt;. As a general rule, remember that<br/>there are still many viewers who will be viewing your description on an<br/>80-column screen with 24 to 28 rows. Two or three solid paragraphs can describe<br/>most environments well, and if there are things that are absolutely crucial to<br/>your room or building project, I suggest the use of +view code, senses code, or<br/>other such softcoded devices to add ambience to your building.<br/>	Since I've mentioned them, let's discuss how to make paragraphs on a<br/>MUSH. How DO people get those carriage returns and tabs in there, anyways?<br/>Without teaching you a bunch of arcane mushcode, I will tell you simply that<br/>there are two 'codes' that you put into your text that create those things.<br/>They are: %r and %t. They are for carriage returns, and tabs, respectively. It<br/>doesn't matter if you have them upper case, or lower case. %r does the same<br/>thing as %R. %T the same as %t. Whichever one you choose to use is up to you.<br/>	They go into your text where you want them to be. People viewing your<br/>descs won't see them, all they will see is a beautifully-formatted paragraph.<br/>An example is: @desc here=Roses are red%R%tViolets are blue%R%t%tI can make line<br/>breaks%R%t%t%tAnd now you can too!<br/>This gives us:<br/>Roses are red<br/>	Violets are blue<br/>		I can make line breaks<br/>			And now you can too!<br/><br/>	I just put the carriage returns and tabs in where I wanted them, and<br/>the game did the rest. For readability(easing the user's comprehension), I<br/>suggest starting /every/ room desc with %R%t and ending /every/ room desc with<br/>%r. This provides a blank line and an indent at the beginning, and a blank line<br/>at the bottom. It frames the desc nicely on the screen, and makes it stand out<br/>from the poses and channel spam around it.<br/>	Back to this room, you're in a barn. Think to yourself what a barn<br/>looks like on the inside. Or what you THINK a barn looks like on the inside, if<br/>you've never been in one. Oftentimes, we will find ourselves describing<br/>something that either isn't real, or we've never seen. So, it falls upon our<br/>creative writing skills and imaginations to create with language an image of<br/>the environment. Try and be descriptive. Better descriptions are enjoyed as<br/>things of beauty by MUSHers, to be hailed and logged, and read over and over<br/>again. Bad descriptions, or ones without any character, are the ones which<br/>become wholly ignored.<br/>	Not every description is Pulitzer-worthy, and not every desc is going<br/>to please everyone, every time it's read. But, you can still try. This is how<br/>you are setting the tone for your environment. I leave it up to you to @desc<br/>your Barn room, using the command: @desc here=&lt;your description&gt;<br/><br/>LOFTY AMBITIONS<br/><br/>	Now, we have described our barn, we've messaged our exits in and out,<br/>and we want to build another room from this one, which is a hayloft. I'm just<br/>going to walk you through the basic process of this, as it is exactly what we<br/>have done in building our original Barn room, just with a different room name,<br/>and exit names.<br/><br/>1) @dig Hayloft=Up to Hayloft &lt;Up&gt;;up;u;up to hayloft;hayloft,Down to Barn<br/>&lt;Down&gt;;down;d;down to barn;barn <br/>2) @set up= transparent (We do this because it's 'logical' that you could see<br/>up into the hayloft from the barn floor.)<br/>3) @desc up=This is a sturdy wooden ladder that leads up into the dim reaches<br/>of the hayloft. Looking up into the hayloft, you see...<br/>(This puts some language to connect the desc of our up exit with the desc of<br/>the next room, in this case the hayloft)<br/>4) @succ up=You climb the ladder, the strong wood rails supporting your weight<br/>without wobbling.<br/>5) @osucc up=climbs the ladder into the hayloft.<br/>6) @odrop up=comes up the ladder from the barn floor below.<br/>7) up<br/>8) @set down=transparent (see #2 above)<br/>9) @desc down=Peering down from the hayloft, you see the ladder and... (see #3<br/>above)<br/>10) @succ down=Using the ladder to defy the forces of gravity, you descend from<br/>the hayloft to the barn floor below.<br/>11) @osucc down=goes down the ladder to the barn floor below.<br/>12) @odrop down=comes down the ladder from the hayloft above.<br/>13) @desc here=&lt;desc of hayloft&gt;. <br/><br/>	Now, let's add a nice 'touch' to our hayloft. It's possible that your<br/>players might want to play out the experience of 'falling' from the hayloft.<br/>But, you don't want to have an exit listed that says: Fall &lt;F&gt;, of course. So,<br/>let's make a dark exit leading from our hayloft to our barn floor.<br/>	First, let's remember that our Barn is dbref #100. And let's go up a<br/>bit and read what was shown about @open being used to open an exit from one<br/>room to another. We don't need an exit back, since the point of the exit is<br/>just to go from the hayloft down to the barn floor.<br/>	So, our commands look like:<br/>1) @open fall=#100 (opens the exit named 'fall' to the Barn below. We don't<br/>really need aliases.)<br/>2) @set fall=dark<br/>3) @desc fall=Careful you don't want to 'fall' out, do you? (The quotes give a<br/>little hint, just in case someone should happen to look at it.)<br/>4) @succ fall=Whoa! You slip and fall out of the hayloft, tumbling down to the<br/>barn floor below!<br/>5) @osucc fall=tumbles out of the hayloft, falling down to the barn floor<br/>below!<br/>6) @odrop fall=falls out of the hayloft!<br/><br/>	In a case like this, I strongly suggest adding a quoted 'hint'(like<br/>that) in the desc of the room as well, so that players can clue in that 'fall'<br/>might be a command they can type in this room to produce an effect. This didn't<br/>take any softcode, no teleporting, and you now have a way to fall out of the<br/>hayloft!<br/><br/>@TEL ME ABOUT THE MISSING @LINK<br/><br/>	If you already have an exit that connects one room to another, a<br/>mistake in the name, a missing alias, an error in any of the messages, an exit<br/>that doesn't connect to the right room, or any number of other common errors<br/>that occur with messages, you can fix any of them...without destroying the<br/>exit! A lot of people tend to @nuke a lot of things when they are first<br/>building, because it has a 'mistake'. The only time you ever need to do that is<br/>if you don't need the object anymore. If there is a mistake in it, either in a<br/>message, its name, or some other attribute, change /that/ instead of @nuking.<br/>	Exits can be picked up and moved, if you own them. You simply 'get<br/>&lt;exit&gt;', move to the new location and then 'drop &lt;exit&gt;' where you want it. Or,<br/>you can @teleport the exit to its new location, using the dbref numbers. This<br/>effectively 'moves' the exit, without changing its destination.<br/>	If you /do/ need to change the destination of an exit, all you need to<br/>do is @link &lt;exit&gt;=&lt;new dbref&gt;. Again, you need to always reference the new<br/>destination with the dbref of the room. This changes the destination of your<br/>exit from the old room, to the new one that you have specified. Messages can<br/>always be reset, or edited.<br/><br/>EDIT SHMEDIT<br/><br/>	One of the most powerful commands at your disposal when building is<br/>@edit. For many MUSHers, it is easy to cut and paste a description, for others<br/>it is just a matter of scrolling back a few commands and editing the mistake<br/>you made. But, there are times when you come across something glaring, perhaps<br/>something you built a few weeks ago and so the command isn't in your buffer<br/>anymore. Or perhaps you just realized how often you've been spelling<br/>'the' as 'teh'.<br/>	The @edit command allows you to take the contents of an attribute,<br/>specify text to change, and text to change it to, and it does it. There are two<br/>points to note about using @edit. The first is, it will edit EVERY instance of<br/>the text, inside that attribute. So, if you only need to change one small<br/>error, make sure you give a specific enough example. <br/>	The second is, if the text you are wanting to edit contains commas, put<br/>your text inside curly braces( { } )! Here is the syntax for @edit:<br/><br/>	@edit &lt;object&gt;/&lt;attribute&gt;=&lt;text to change&gt;,&lt;new text&gt;<br/><br/>	The reason for being so picky about the commas should be clear. @edit<br/>uses a comma to separate its old text from its new text. So, the first comma it<br/>sees that is not inside a curly brace is going to be treated as the divider.<br/>Here is a brief example:<br/><br/>@desc ball=This is a big red ball, with a broad white strip around it.<br/><br/>	There is a typo in there, deliberately. So, I could retype this, or I<br/>can use @edit. Since I'm trying to teach YOU to use @edit, let's do it that<br/>way:<br/>	@edit ball/desc=strip,stripe<br/><br/>	The desc now reads:<br/>This is a big red ball, with a broad white stripe around it.<br/>	Now, what if we wanted to put a phrase after 'ball,' that says 'about<br/>eight inches in diameter,'? This is where we would need to use the {}. <br/>	@edit ball/desc={ball,},{ball, about eight inches in diameter,}<br/><br/>	The desc now reads:<br/>This is a big red ball, about eight inches in diameter, with a broad white<br/>stripe around it.<br/>	@edit takes a little bit of practice to have it work every time. But,<br/>once you have mastered it, you have one of the most powerful text-editing tools<br/>on the MUSH, at your disposal.<br/><br/>SUMMARY<br/><br/>	Well, look at what you know now! You now know how to sit atop a pile of<br/>virtual matter, carve out a space to serve as a room, and make portals that<br/>carry you to and from that room. You're armed with the skills to make those<br/>devices interactive and descriptive, and you know how to edit any mistakes you<br/>might make. All in all, you're able to do a fair amount with only a little bit<br/>of training. And you thought this was going to be hard!<br/>	Some last words of advice I will give. Building is all of the things I<br/>listed at the opening to this tutorial. It is an exact science, it is an arcane<br/>art, it is frustrating at times, but it is also the method by which you create<br/>your vision and imagination for the enjoyment of others. Like all creative<br/>pursuits, you get better at it, the more you do it. Hemingway's first writings<br/>were certainly not what garnered him the fame he has today. You don't have to<br/>be Hemingway to build, though. It is much less about how good your building is<br/>compared to someone else's. That's /your/ judgement. Do your best to use the<br/>best language you can to describe what you see in your head, and be proud of<br/>what you have created.<br/>	Last, be aware of spatial relationships when building. Mainly, this is<br/>present in what you name your exits. If you are building a house, make sure<br/>that the upstairs rooms are 'virtually' over a downstairs room, otherwise<br/>they're probably going to be hanging out in space. If you're building a forest,<br/>make sure that your directions(N, S, E, W) remain consistent. Don't have your<br/>players going north, then west, and being back where they started. Be aware of<br/>how large each room is supposed to be, and describe it accordingly. All rooms<br/>on a MUSH are the same size: Infinite. How large they appear depends on how you<br/>describe them. @dig does not diffrentiate between a closet and a ballroom.<br/>	Most of all, enjoy yourself. Again, this is an exercise in creativity.<br/>Enjoy setting your hand to the creation of an environ that is hopefully going<br/>to add flavour, character, and a viable venue for RP to your MUSH.<br/><br/>Happy Building!
