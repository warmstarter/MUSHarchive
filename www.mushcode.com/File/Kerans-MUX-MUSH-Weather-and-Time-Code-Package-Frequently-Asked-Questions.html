        Keran's MUX/MUSH Weather and Time Code Package<br/>Frequently Asked Questions<br/>Current MUX, PennMUSH, and TinyMUSH-2.2 Versions: 4.0 beta<br/><br/>I'm going to be retiring from MUSHing at the end of<br/>March 2000, at which time this code will become unsupported.<br/>That means I won't be around to help fix broken installations<br/>or to maintain the code. It also means I won't be releasing<br/>the planned version 5.0. Before the end of March 2000, I'll<br/>release a version of 4.0 for TinyMUSH 3, assuming the MUX<br/>version doesn't work. (As of TM3b19, the MUX version nearly<br/>works, but TM3 doesn't accept 32-character attribute names<br/>and MUX 1.6 does. There are a couple of 32-character attribute<br/>names in the MUX version.)<br/><br/>The 4.0 versions will be available for download from my Web page.<br/><br/>I'm retiring from MUSHing because my interest in it depends<br/>on my interest in roleplaying, which has wholly given way<br/>to a long-dormant interest in writing, somewhat to my<br/>surprise. I'm now writing an ebook review column instead.<br/><br/><br/>1. What servers does the weather and time code run on?<br/><br/>TinyMUX 1.4 and 1.6; it probably runs on earlier MUX versions,<br/>but the current release hasn't been tested on them.<br/><br/>The code will execute on TinyMUX 1.5, which is a beta release,<br/>but there are memory leaks in it, which this code appears<br/>to invoke; it should not be run on 1.5 without very frequent<br/>shutdowns, as otherwise the memory leaks cause your process<br/>size to grow without bounds and eventually can crash your<br/>host.<br/><br/>4.0 has been ported to PennMUSH 1.7.2 and TinyMUSH 2.2.2.<br/>It will be ported to TinyMUSH 3.0 before the end of March 2000.<br/><br/><br/>2. Will you port it to ...?<br/><br/>I'm not going to port it to any non-MUSH-family servers, but<br/>you can if you like. I expect to port to TinyMUSH 3.0 when it's<br/>released (assuming it needs porting; it may well not).<br/><br/>I have resigned my bit on the 4.0 PennMUSH site, and there is<br/>some possibility that the yet-unwritten version 5.0 will only be<br/>released for TinyMUSH 3.0. I may port to Penn if someone<br/>offers a port site for it, and if future changes to PennMUSH<br/>are not sufficiently annoying to persuade me to abandon the<br/>platform. I have disliked many recent changes.<br/><br/><br/>3. What are the features of the weather and time code?<br/><br/>The 3.0 features:<br/><br/> -- Time functions for determining the year, month, season, time of day,<br/>  tide, and moon phase; <br/> -- A weathermaker that determines a different weather type every day; <br/> -- Day and night length that vary by season and can be adjusted for<br/>  approximate latitude;<br/> -- A weather description bank with descriptions that vary by time of day<br/>  and season; <br/> -- An outdoor parent room that makes it easy to write descriptions that<br/>  vary by time of day, season, weather, and the visibility of the<br/>  moon;<br/> -- Configurable time compression ratios, in two different modes. You can<br/>  accelerate all time with clock compression, or skip days with<br/>  calendar compression. You can run at 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 3:2, or 1:1 by<br/>  changing a few settings; <br/> -- Simple adjustable weather modelling; <br/> -- An optional quasi-Gregorian calendar in addition to the native<br/>  calendar; <br/> -- Clock code that can send out messages to specified receivers at given<br/>  times, such as sunrise, moonset, other time of day transitions, or<br/>  at specific hours.<br/> -- An auxiliary bank of descriptions varying by season, time of day, and<br/>  weather, geared to surroundings with a lot of leafy trees, to<br/>  illustrate how to make auxiliary desc banks for different<br/>  environments; <br/> -- Regional weather, and a sample slave weather station.<br/><br/>4.0 also has:<br/><br/> -- A collection of outdoor parent rooms that make it easy to write<br/>  descriptions that vary by time of day, season, weather, and the<br/>  visibility of the moon, in different styles;<br/> -- Indoor parent rooms for writing descriptions that vary with lighting<br/>  conditions and the visual capability of the viewer;<br/> -- A parent room hierarchy that means you can write your own parent<br/>  rooms and easily have them recognized as the correct type of room;<br/> -- An option for taking the date from the system clock in 1:1 time; <br/>Clock code that can send out messages to specified receivers every<br/>  hour, every half-hour, or every quarter hour.<br/> -- A reasonably realistic moon; <br/> -- Diurnal or semi-diurnal tides synchronized with the moon;<br/> -- A Storm Maker that can be used to do global, area, and room type emits<br/>  to allow the production of storms, earthquakes, blackouts, etc.<br/> -- A test room for ensuring that the whole thing works.<br/> -- Even more confusing +help. ("Impossible!" cry the skeptics. "Your<br/>  code is easier to read than your +help!")<br/> -- OK, seriously, reorganized +help. I hope it's clearer.<br/><br/><br/>4. What's planned for the next version?<br/><br/>I'm no longer planning to release another version.<br/><br/><br/>5. What environments can it model?<br/><br/>Almost any environment with earthlike weather you feel like writing<br/>description banks for. The supplied description banks are for a moist<br/>northern hemisphere mid-latitude temperate climate; the short<br/>descriptions on the Weathermaker, and the general weather descriptions<br/>on the Weather Long Description bank, describe atmospheric conditions<br/>in such an environment. You can rewrite them so they suit warmer or<br/>colder climates. There is also one auxiliary description bank<br/>supplied, the Tree Weather Description Bank, which gives descriptions<br/>of a temperate environment with a lot of deciduous trees; the<br/>descriptions vary by day, night, season, and weathertype. It is<br/>simple, although laborious, to write description banks for cities,<br/>deserts, grassland, seacoasts, etc.<br/><br/>You can also change the frequency with which different weathertypes<br/>are selected by the Weathermaker at various seasons. For example, the<br/>default setting produces a lot of fog in summer because it's for an<br/>island. It would be comparatively simple to reduce the amount of<br/>summer fog but increase the frequency of snow in winter for an upland<br/>setting; this is just a question of varying the number of times a<br/>given weathertype appears in the selection lists on the Weathermaker.<br/><br/>You will have to change the order of the Gregorian months on the Time<br/>Functions object if you're using the quasi-Gregorian calendar for a<br/>setting in the southern hemisphere.<br/><br/><br/>6. Can I use the weather code without the timing code?<br/><br/>Yes, if you supply other timing code; it is strongly not recommended<br/>that you attempt this unless you're a competent coder; the timing<br/>is the guts of the system. In order to use foreign timing code and<br/>preserve most of the functionality of this weather system, the timing<br/>code must capable of the following:<br/><br/> -- It must, at the very least, distinguish between day and night;<br/>preferably, it distinguishes between day, night, dawn, and dusk.<br/><br/> -- It must distinguish the seasons spring, summer, autumn, and winter.<br/><br/> -- In order for the outdoor parent rooms to work as it does in this<br/>system, there must be a function that tells whether the moon is up<br/>or not.<br/><br/> -- There must be a clock capable of triggering the Weathermaker at dawn.<br/><br/><br/>7. Can I add moons?<br/><br/>Yes. There are instructions for doing it in the configuration<br/>section of the +help.<br/><br/><br/>8. Can I set up weather that varies from region to region?<br/><br/>Yes. You can even track the probable course of storms from region to<br/>region. A sample slave weather station is provided, along with<br/>documentation for how to set up different weather regions. It isn't<br/>recommended that you attempt this unless you are reasonably competent<br/>with code; being able to read and understand some of the code is a<br/>necessity for the setup.<br/><br/><br/>9. Can I set up different time zones?<br/><br/>Probably, although it would take separate copies of the code suite<br/>for each time zone, with a different value for time-begins set on<br/>each copy of the Time Functions object. It hasn't been tested.<br/><br/><br/>10. Can I leave any of these objects out?<br/><br/>Yes. If you don't want regional weather, you don't need the Slave<br/>Weather Station. If you don't have any use for descriptions of an<br/>environment with a lot of broadleafed trees, leave out the Tree<br/>Weather Descriptions Bank. If you don't want to use the global time<br/>of day emits, you can omit the Emits bank, and if you don't want to<br/>use the Storm Maker or the parent rooms, you can leave them out. If<br/>you don't want a moon, you can leave the Moon and Tide object out,<br/>and if you don't want to test the installation, you can leave the<br/>Test Room out. You can also get rid of the test room after you do<br/>test it.<br/><br/><br/>13. What time compression ratios can I use it at?<br/><br/>In calendar compression mode, 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, and 1:1. In clock<br/>compression mode, it's been tested at 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, and 3:2. It<br/>is expected to run at any clock compression ratio involving small<br/>whole numbers by which 3600 can be evenly divided, e.g, it should run<br/>at 5:2 and 1:2, but it has not been tested at all such ratios.<br/><br/><br/>14. Where do I get the code?<br/><br/>http://nw3.nai.net/~keranset/<br/><br/><br/>Keran<br/><br/><br/>
