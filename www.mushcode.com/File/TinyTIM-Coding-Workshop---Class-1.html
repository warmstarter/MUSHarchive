        Thursday Nights, 10pm TDT, we're having a coding workshop at TIM University. The lecturer this time is Sketch the Cow, and the project is The Shuttle Bus To Take You To The Lecture Hall. Of course, having not built it, you have to walk there. Go to plane 18 (18), go North to the Quad (N), North to the Academic Buildings (N) and then to the Abe Vigoda Lecture Hall (ABE). All are welcome, many will enter, all will win. Skill Level: Beginning Coder.<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>You hop a bus to TIM U., and jump off at the Campus Center.<br/><br/>TIM University - Campus Center<br/><br/>You're in the lobby of the Campus Center of TIM U., TinyTIM's official neo-liberal-arts-science-tech-business school. Around you pass by hundreds of zonked-out college students wearing baggy, underwashed clothing over their undernourished, underfed frames, babbling about inane things that they think matter, but in the grand scheme of things really don't. Across the back wall is a giant logo of the school's mascot, the "Fightin' Amish".<br/><br/>Through the quintuple glass doors north lies the main Quad of the campus, to the other buildings. The bus route back to the Nexus is south.<br/><br/>Obvious exits:<br/><br/>Student Store&lt;SS&gt; Nexus&lt;out&gt; Quad&lt;N&gt;<br/><br/>You push open the glass doors and stroll out onto the campus.<br/><br/>TIM University - the Quad<br/><br/>Across the pleasant green rectangle of the campus Quad stroll a number of alternately bookish and slacker-looking students. In the center of the Quad stands a large bronze statue of TIM gazing sternly off into the horizon. Rough path-like brown patches run across the ordinarily-green grass marking common student routes.<br/><br/>From here, the Academic Complex is north. The Administration tower leers off to the east, with the Campus Center south. The large foofball field lies to the east, while the dorm complex is southwest. Fraternity Row runs off to the northwest.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>Statue of TIM<br/><br/>Obvious exits:<br/><br/>Fraternity Row&lt;NW&gt; Dorms&lt;SW&gt; Foofball Field&lt;W&gt; Administration&lt;E&gt; Academic Complex&lt;N&gt; Campus Center&lt;S&gt;<br/><br/>You found a penny!<br/><br/>You head east to the Admin building.<br/><br/>Admin Building<br/><br/>The Administration building is filled with middle-aged men and women who all live for their next cup of coffee. In the background you can hear the whirring of innumerous copiers all helping to add to the paper chase found at any University. The smell of toner and the sight of too many people wearing ties gives you little urge to venture beyond the outer lobby.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>INFO SIGN<br/><br/>Obvious exits:<br/><br/>Quad&lt;W&gt;<br/><br/>You return to the Quad.<br/><br/>TIM University - the Quad<br/><br/>Across the pleasant green rectangle of the campus Quad stroll a number of alternately bookish and slacker-looking students.

You're dating the professor for your grade!"<br/><br/>Territan says "But it's so fun!"<br/><br/>JoeyLemur whips a rifle out of his overcoat, and shoots the apple on the lecturn. Apple bits go flying. JoeyLemur quietly puts the rifle back under his overcoat.<br/><br/>Malady snores and drools a bit on his fold-out desk.<br/><br/>Coal says "Nah, Reo. I'm MARRYING him for my grade. I'm dating him to find out the answers for the tests."<br/><br/>Malady holds up a sign (without waking up): HATE TO SEE WHAT SHE DOES FOR THE FINAL<br/><br/>JoeyLemur laughs.<br/><br/>Coal grins.<br/><br/>Malady puts the sign down, and snores.<br/><br/>Br'fin says "And Badger pipes up that that's what the Honeymoon is for""<br/><br/>JoeyLemur says "You know, I could have gone my life without the mental images that created."<br/><br/>Sketch likes those mental images, actually.<br/><br/>Malady waves to Badger, mumbles something about football practice, then falls asleep again.<br/><br/>JoeyLemur says "Well, you would."<br/><br/>You say "I can only imagine the sexiness of a cow making love to a piece of coal."<br/><br/>Sketch says "DAMNED Sexy, man."<br/><br/>Coal says "Woowoo."<br/><br/>Territan says "That's because you're a PARTICIPANT, Sketch. That might have something to do with it."<br/><br/>Sketch can't help who he is.<br/><br/>Br'fin snickers from his portable game system.<br/><br/>Elsinore has arrived.<br/><br/>Br'fin says "Heya sis"<br/><br/>Elsinore says "Anyone got a pen I could borrow? ;)"<br/><br/>Drool runs from Malady's desk top to the floor.<br/><br/>Sketch is going to wait 5 minutes after 10:00 because some people are into being fashionably late.<br/><br/>Farward has arrived.<br/><br/>Br'fin laughs "Of course, Elsi<br/><br/>Created: #37312<br/><br/>Br'fin slips a purple pen to Elsinore.<br/><br/>Locked.<br/><br/>Name set: Ballpoint pen<br/><br/>Set.<br/><br/>Natalie has arrived.<br/><br/>Natalie hugs around.<br/><br/>XA: @wait 500=:runs out of ink.<br/><br/>Sketch has connected.<br/><br/>Farward nods at everyone, just so he doesn't appear antisocial.<br/><br/>Given.<br/><br/>Triggered.<br/><br/>Sketch says "let's cover that right now."<br/><br/>Flag set.<br/><br/>Sketch says "This is not the Nexus.

But you can page him with questions in case Sketch is busy.<br/><br/>Coal quietly retches after typing that.<br/><br/>Sketch says "And like I said, my problem with hugs was when it represents the only thing you do on TIM all day."<br/><br/>Natalie smirks.<br/><br/>Sketch says "That makes you like the fat guy in the diner who nurses the same cup of coffee for 8 hours."<br/><br/>Natalie gives Reo an.. apple.<br/><br/>Elsinore says "ew."<br/><br/>Natalie suppresses a giggle.<br/><br/>Sketch eats grass.<br/><br/>Reo eats it, worm and all.<br/><br/>Coal says "Careful Reo. Look where that led Adam."<br/><br/>R'nice says "My problem with hugs is when you forget to put down those two big cactuses your'e holding before you hug me."<br/><br/>You say "Cacti."<br/><br/>Reo slaps himself.<br/><br/>Sketch says "CACTUS HUGS" and runs towards R'nice.<br/><br/>Natalie holds three cacti and hugs R'nice.<br/><br/>Elsinore only has a toothy gator, but she puts it down to hug R'nice.<br/><br/>R'nice is the fat guy in the diner who doesn't drink coffee.<br/><br/>Elsinore laughs.<br/><br/>Sketch says "It's time for the old SAGGARRO SNUGGLE"<br/><br/>You say "Qapla'?"<br/><br/>JoeyLemur attaches hedgehogs to himself and then chases R'Nice.<br/><br/>Malady chuckles.<br/><br/>Elsinore says "Hey R'Nice did your Daily Show already go by? Did I miss it?"<br/><br/>R'nice says "You missed it."<br/><br/>Elsinore says "oh wait, i don't get the comedy channel anyway."<br/><br/>Coal is bringing her tape of it to the KhaOS BBQ tomorrow.<br/><br/>Elsinore says "oh cool."<br/><br/>Sketch shouts "Coding Workshop, starting within a minute or two. First and Final announcement."<br/><br/>Br'fin says "Neat"<br/><br/>Natalie hopes there's enough KhaOS to go around.<br/><br/>Br'fin says "Been watching Battlebots on Comedy Central myself"<br/><br/>Squeaky gets out her datapad<br/><br/>Sketch says "Most workshops don't have true beginners mixed up with rembrandt level coders. This will be interesting."<br/><br/>Malady whoops! "Battlebots!!"<br/><br/>Reo doesn't understand WHY battlebots is on CC now. On PBS/TLC was just fine.<br/><br/>R'nice is just auditing the course.<br/><br/>Territan says "I'm here primarily for support."<br/><br/>Coal has never seen Battlebots?<br/><br/>Squeaky says "My boyfriend is in those"<br/><br/>Sydney has arrived.<br/><br/>Jenn has arrived.<br/><br/>Coal says "Hey Jenn!"<br/><br/>Natalie sits next to R'nice and copies from his mind. :)<br/><br/>Jenn says "Hello!"<br/><br/>Coal saved Jenn a seat at the back with the cool kids.<br/><br/>R'nice is actually mostly watching Win Ben Stein's Money, but he'll want to read the transcript afterwords.<br/><br/>JoeyLemur enjoys Scrapheap Challenge / Junkyard Wars himself.<br/><br/>Jenn steals Natalie's notes.<br/><br/>You say "People build robots to compete/fight."<br/><br/>Elsinore wonders if Br'fin and R'Nice are the TA's.<br/><br/>Mara has arrived.<br/><br/>Reo nods at JL. That's very popular too.<br/><br/>Sketch heard R'nice was a hellish TA.<br/><br/>Natalie will photocopy 'em for you, Jenn!<br/><br/>Xarisa has arrived.<br/><br/>Empedocles has arrived.<br/><br/>Dilettante says "It's brand new, Coal... only ast 2 weeks"<br/><br/>R'nice says "Only hellish if you sucked. :)"<br/><br/>JoeyLemur says "Blonde British chick in shiny clothing... mmm..."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Woo, 2 minutes."<br/><br/>Br'fin says "Copying from me is it's own punishment, you'll be challenged to explain what it does :)"<br/><br/>Coal says "2 minutes to start?"<br/><br/>Dilettante says "I wish I had a video if when we did something like battlebots in HS... all I have is a few pics that I found online ofus"<br/><br/>You say "Kegger in the quad after lecture!"<br/><br/>Dilettante says "With flame throwers..."<br/><br/>Dilettante says "Of, not if"<br/><br/>Territan says "Kegger with flamethrowers? OOOOH!"<br/><br/>Farward says "My grasp of MUSH coding comes from a more recent variety of MUSH and doesn't quite mesh with what works well here. That's why I'm going to sit in on this session."<br/><br/>Dilettante says "No, Territan... we have flamethrower equipped robots :)"<br/><br/>JoeyLemur yells "CAN I GET A FOOF?"<br/><br/>Xarisa says "And there was much rejoicing. yay."<br/><br/>Territan says "yay -- damn, got it backwards again!"<br/><br/>You say "Aya. Surrender your mitochondria."<br/><br/>Malady jumps up in the air and yells "YAY!"<br/><br/>From JoeyLemur's overcoat, Programming Test Box Thingy attempts to laser "Yay!" into everyone's eyes simultaneously, causing a wicked light show.<br/><br/>Coal has the same problem, Farward.<br/><br/>Elsinore says "Take it outta the classroom, that's all I say!"<br/><br/>Malady is clueless and stupid as far as @HELP goes. That's why he's here.<br/><br/>Jenn says "Yay!"<br/><br/>Sydney yays.<br/><br/>Br'fin says "yay"<br/><br/>JoeyLemur yells "THAT'S THE TIM SPIRIT! GOOOO FIGHTIN' AMISH!"<br/><br/>Elsinore says "Um, er, yay!~"<br/><br/>sam says "Yay!"<br/><br/>Xarisa goes home.<br/><br/>Xarisa says, "Listen, I'd love to chat, but I've gotta climb a drainpipe right now. Why? Because I ran out of faery dust and I don't know how to fly." She repeats to herself, "Why?" and, giggling, climbs her own drainpipe.<br/><br/>Xarisa has left.<br/><br/>Farward gives Malady a clue. "It's just HELP, not @HELP." He winks.<br/><br/>Dilettante yells a late "yay".<br/><br/>Territan says "ATM at the Amish Market."<br/><br/>Sketch says "OKAY!"<br/><br/>Elsinore falls asleep now. zzz<br/><br/>JoeyLemur removes the dissected chicken from his workbench to make room for tonight's project.<br/><br/>R'nice wakes up. Commercial.<br/><br/>Sketch says "This is the first of these things, so not all the rules and the paradigms and other fun stuff is firmly established. Format and approach may completely change, and the lecturer/workshop leader will DEFINITELY rotate out."<br/><br/>sam remove his dissected pizza.<br/><br/>Sketch says "Already thinking about this whole thing, I do have a few ground rules though."<br/><br/>Br'fin nods<br/><br/>Sketch says "First of all, this is response to, but is not to be tainted with our little renaissance/revolution/complete destruction of TinyTIM that is going on out in the Nexus. Bring that in here, I bring you out of here."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Second of all, I'm uncomfortable with lecture. I'm going to show you how I would approach a problem, focusing on the easy, using basic code approach, not the full-bore-on Sketch approach, because that will kill you."<br/><br/>Sketch says "But I encourage you to build your own with you. You can feel free to build carrying the objects or to drop them and build them."<br/><br/>Br'fin snickers.<br/><br/>Sketch says "if you do drop them or build them, I want them examinable. I'll explain that in a moment."<br/><br/>Br'fin hides the spatula to scrape up folks after their brain explodes.<br/><br/>Elsinore pokes Br'fin. Shh!<br/><br/>R'nice raises his hand.<br/><br/>Sketch says "yes, R'nice?"<br/><br/>R'nice says "Are we allowed to heckle?"<br/><br/>Sketch says "Of course."<br/><br/>R'nice says "Thank you."<br/><br/>Farward says "Oh, good. I'd hate to see R'nice explode."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Few profs/leaders are in the position of discussing a subject next to the person who caused it."<br/><br/>R'nice smiles<br/><br/>JoeyLemur heckles. "Your mother was a carton of Ben and Jerry's!"<br/><br/>Natalie is, in that case, eating your mother. EW!<br/><br/>Natalie @ptuis.<br/><br/>Territan says "And your father smelled of Absolut Citron!"<br/><br/>Sketch says "Another thing, the companion to the mention I just had about the Nexus stuff, is that I WILL say that one of the basic things I was indicating in my letter is that there's NO such attention to subject matter/context/intelligent discourse in any other room in the game, so I'm not going to be sitting here making mention of context/grammar/flow. Etc."<br/><br/>Sketch says "I'm here to teach. Let me get on with that."<br/><br/>Elsinore says "here here"<br/><br/>Territan sits back and shuts up.<br/><br/>Coal says "Yeah, get on with it!"<br/><br/>Sketch says "I'm going to take advantage of TIM's ability to do pages and whispers. So we don't have to worry about people not admitting to understanding something in front of the group."<br/><br/>Sketch says "If you want to ask a question that you're embarassed to ask for some strange reason, you whisper it, and it'll spontaneously get answered while I'm doing stuff."<br/><br/>Sketch says "The first such question. Does everyone here understand the concept of the @create command?"<br/><br/>Malady does.<br/><br/>JoeyLemur says "Yup."<br/><br/>Kahlua has arrived.<br/><br/>Biff the Wonder Parrot has arrived.<br/><br/>Sketch says "Just page me no if you don't."<br/><br/>Jenn says "Mostly."<br/><br/>Squeaky nods<br/><br/>Natalie nods.<br/><br/>sam nods.<br/><br/>Kahlua says "biff, go away"<br/><br/>Biff the Wonder Parrot says "Okay, seeya."<br/><br/>You say "Should we answer in the affirmative, or just keep quiet unless we don't?"<br/><br/>Biff the Wonder Parrot has left.<br/><br/>Kahlua says "Please excuse my lateness."<br/><br/>Sketch says "I'd prefer you keep quiet unless you don't."<br/><br/>Sketch makes everyone point at Kahlua and @nelsonlaugh his lame late ass.<br/><br/>Reo points at Kahlua and does the Nelson Laugh, "Ha-Ha!"<br/><br/>Coal points at Kahlua and does the Nelson Laugh, "Ha-Ha!"<br/><br/>Kahlua hangs his head. "Hey, that really hurts..."<br/><br/>Sketch says "OK, we all have the create command. Do you understand the concept of flags as they apply to programming?"<br/><br/>JoeyLemur points at Kahula, and burps.<br/><br/>Malady doesn't.<br/><br/>Territan points at Kahlua and tries to do the Nelson Laugh, but his finger falls off. "Ow."<br/><br/>Squeaky is not quite sure. Has only found some flags<br/><br/>JoeyLemur doesn't have a clear idea.<br/><br/>Natalie could use further explanation of flags.<br/><br/>Sketch says "And finally, who here has never done coding on TIM beyond the setting of your attributes?"<br/><br/>Mara raises her hnand<br/><br/>Elsinore has done very minimal.<br/><br/>Malady raises a tentacle.<br/><br/>Br'fin raises several hands.<br/><br/>JoeyLemur has attempted to code... really...<br/><br/>Sketch sets Br'fin on fire.<br/><br/>Jenn raises her hand<br/><br/>Natalie hasn't done much.<br/><br/>Br'fin gets confused by grammar<br/><br/>Empedocles raises some of Br'fin's hands.<br/><br/>Coal has done some but not particularly successfully. Does that count?<br/><br/>RedEVIL has arrived.<br/><br/>Sketch says "Someone mentioned how the location of this lecture was in a somewhat odd place. As a result, tonight's project is a basic vehicle."<br/><br/>Sketch says "I'm building The TinyTIM Short Bus."<br/><br/>Sketch says "I rate this at the level of Beginner."<br/><br/>Sketch says "For the benefit of the more advanced coders in the audience, I am building the version that simply uses the inventory of the object to hold people."<br/><br/>Sketch says "And for those of you new to this, we are building a version of vehicles that are simple and functional, but of course there are much more advanced ways to build vehicles that can be covered in other lecturers or outside this workshop."<br/><br/>Biff the Wonder Parrot has arrived.<br/><br/>rainy has arrived.<br/><br/>Biff the Wonder Parrot perches happily on Elsinore's shoulder.<br/><br/>JoeyLemur gets out a parrot rifle...<br/><br/>Sketch says "Suffice to say, that like all basically interesting ideas in TIM code, you can go absolutely bugfuck on adding features."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Also, I will apologize ahead of time for my occasional pauses as I answer questions in whispers or generally have net weirdness."<br/><br/>Biff the Wonder Parrot goes home.<br/><br/>Biff the Wonder Parrot has left.<br/><br/>Territan says "'Bugfuck' will be covered in a later class, I hope. My technique only runs up as far as 'apeshit.'"<br/><br/>Sketch says "In TIM, there are 5 types of objects. Players, Things, Exits, Rooms, and generally garbage. But that's kind of a "sometimes y" situation, because you never really come into contact with garbage."<br/><br/>Sketch says "In the usual TIM way, you generally do programming on Things."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Programming can exist on Rooms and exits, but we're going to be building a thing."<br/><br/>Sketch says "it's generally good to have a clear idea of what you want to add to TIM, and whether it's worth building."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Here, I see a need to have a neat object that takes people to the Lecture hall because that sign won't always be out there."<br/><br/>Sketch says "So I think about what I want it to be; I want it to be fun, I want it to do what it says, and I want it to be somewhat flexible."<br/><br/>Sketch says "So hence the name, The TinyTIM Short Bus."<br/><br/>Sketch says "I create an object, like this: @create The TinyTIM Short Bus"<br/><br/>Sketch says "if you make one, name it something different."<br/><br/>Territan says "Or for the politically correct in the class, the TinyTIM Horizontally Challenged Bus."<br/><br/>JoeyLemur dropped PCIBus.<br/><br/>Sketch dropped The TinyTIM Short Bus.<br/><br/>R'nice says "I suggest you put your name on the object name."<br/><br/>R'nice says "That way we can easily see whose is shose"<br/><br/>Sketch says "R'nice has a good idea there."<br/><br/>Natalie dropped Natalie's Boots.<br/><br/>Sketch says "The @create command pulls out a garbage object from the database and declares it a thing, and makes you the owner, and puts it in your inventory with the name you gave it."<br/><br/>Coal dropped Coal's Bus Of DOOM!.<br/><br/>Sydney dropped SydneyvaD lupwI'.<br/><br/>Squeaky says "Ack too late"<br/><br/>Elsinore dropped Elsinore's Carry-a-Castle.<br/><br/>Kahlua dropped Kahlua's Moving Roadblock.<br/><br/>Sketch says "This costs you some pennies, but pennies are cheap and we reward builders."<br/><br/>Farward dropped lupDuj / Farward's Shuttlecraft.<br/><br/>Created: #69756<br/><br/>I don't know which one you mean!<br/><br/>Flag set.<br/><br/>Squeaky dropped Squeaky's TinyTMI longbus..<br/><br/>You don't have that!<br/><br/>Dropped.<br/><br/>Jenn dropped Jenn's Bus to Hell.<br/><br/>Abe Vigoda Memorial Lecture Hall<br/><br/>The campus' main lecture hall is wide and spacious, with rows of uncomfortable seats inclining downward towards the wooden podium.

So the EXAMINE command shows you the "programming" side of something on TIM, separate from what people usually see when they interact with this stuff. You can ALWAYS examine your own stuff."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Let's set a second flag: ENTER_OK. @SET &lt;Your Bus&gt; = ENTER_OK."<br/><br/>Sketch says "We all understand I have the habit of putting something you fill in the blank for in &lt;&gt;'s, right? you don't type those."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Most of you caught all that at the welcome screen, so I figured."<br/><br/>Flag set.<br/><br/>Sketch says "OK, what you just did is make it so anyone can ENTER your bus."<br/><br/>Sketch says "Normally, only you can enter your own bus."<br/><br/>Natalie raises her hand.<br/><br/>Sketch says "yes?"<br/><br/>Malady dropped Malady's Rocket.<br/><br/>Natalie says "How would @locking the bus affect enter_ok?"<br/><br/>Elsinore gives Natalie the bathroom pass.<br/><br/>Natalie says "Or effect it.

Okay.<br/><br/>Sketch says "But there are ways to affect it, using an ENTER LOCK."<br/><br/>Elsinore locks the bathroom.<br/><br/>Territan says "The regular lock on the bus means people can't pick it up and walk off with it."<br/><br/>Sketch says "But that's out of the scope of this class.

And like these other Tinygames, TIM<br/><br/>lets you set the "Description" of Rooms, Players, Exits and Object with the<br/><br/>@DESC Command. This lets you create the text that is displayed when you<br/><br/>LOOK at that Thing.<br/><br/>Well, TinyTIM has gone a step farther than that, and we now have ALL FIVE<br/><br/>Senses active on the game. This means that in addition to being able to<br/><br/>LOOK at everything, it is also theoretically possible to SMELL, TASTE,<br/><br/>LISTEN, and TOUCH everything as well. For instance, in the Nexus, you can<br/><br/>say TASTE OLD MAN, or TOUCH CLOCK, and you'll get an interesting response.<br/><br/>Here are the commands you should know to be able to use Senses properly on<br/><br/>TIM. Simply type HELP &lt;TOPIC&gt; for information on that command.<br/><br/>LOOK TASTE TOUCH SMELL LISTEN<br/><br/>@DESC @TASTE @TOUCH @SCENT @SOUND<br/><br/>@ATOUCH @OTOUCH @ATASTE @OTASTE<br/><br/>Use your senses!<br/><br/>Sketch says "HELP SENSES work, but I'll also mention the commands. @scent for smell, @sound for the sound, @taste for the taste, and @touch for the feel of it."<br/><br/>Jenn's Bus to Hell grows ears and can now hear.<br/><br/>Malady's Rocket grows ears and can now hear.<br/><br/>Sketch says "In each case, you want to build an object such that all the different senses combine to really flesh out the object."<br/><br/>Set.<br/><br/>Sketch says "Some people are typing @LISTEN instead of @SOUND.
