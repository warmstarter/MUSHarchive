You may copy and redistribute this document provided<br/>that it remains complete, with credits intact, and is used only for<br/>non-profit purposes. <br/>----------------------------------------<br/>Lecture Room<br/>Aleriel has arrived.<br/>Moses welcomes Aleriel.<br/>Moses pokes Parity to see if it is awake.<br/>Aleriel thanks. "Looks like you'll be teaching just me :)"<br/>Moses chuckles. Their loss.<br/>You say "I'll get started."<br/>Aleriel sits comfortably.<br/>You say "Okay, while this class(?) is going to be themed with +wear in mind, it really is to be<br/>about how to approach building/coding a full system."<br/>You say "What I mean by system is: a set of inter-related commands, with all of the commands <br/>acting upon one common set of data. Most systems are global systems, but in any context, a<br/>coded system is a multi-functional set of related commands, all acting upon one collection of <br/>shared or common data."<br/>You say "Which is all technical for saying, a lot of commands that just use one set of stuff to <br/>work with."<br/>GoI-Envoy Sae has arrived.<br/>Moses will repose the little bit he's said for Goi's benefit.<br/>{Post-lecture Note: I just said the three things I had said before for Goi-Envoy Sae's<br/>benefit.}<br/>You say "I'm hoping that we can all discuss these questions so that the class will be somewhat <br/>interactive until we get to the real code."<br/>Moth has arrived.<br/>You say "As well, I am logging this so that it can be posted to the website. If you don't want <br/>your comments noted, please tell me now, and I'll edit you out later."<br/>You say "Moth, what I'm doing now is I'm going to list a few questions I ask before I start any <br/>major coding project, and we'll discuss them."<br/>Moth nods, cool by me<br/>You say "Aleriel, are you a staffer anymu*?"<br/>Aleriel nods, "Yes"<br/>Aleriel says "I staff on B5:RS and a few other places"<br/>Moses nods. Okay, good, there will be room for discussion about security issues.<br/>You say "Now, on to the questions."<br/>You say "1) What is the list of capabilities I want this system to have? Put another way,<br/>what is the list of things I want players to be able to do with this code?"<br/>You say "THis is /always/ the first thing I ask myself."<br/>You say "So, we're going to be basing this class on a +wear, aka multidescer."<br/>You say "What are things that you guys like to see in a multidescer? All the things we agree<br/>on will be coded by us, throughout this and further classes."<br/>Aleriel hmms. "Add a new desc, change descs, add on to existing desc, delete a desc"<br/>Aleriel says "combine two or more descs"<br/>Moses nods. all good things.<br/>You say "Moth, Goi?"<br/>GoI-Envoy Sae smiles. "Call me Sae, or Saeran, please. As for the descer, all of what Aleriel <br/>said, plus eas of use and inability to break stuff by misusing it. I know those are more<br/>general."<br/>Moses nods to the name.<br/>Moth says "Most +wear codebits I've seen have been overcomplicated. Most important for me is <br/>Simplicity, overall ease of use... so very basic commands: add, edit/change, delete"<br/>Moth likes to keep it simple because, as Parity knows, I'm code challenged ;)<br/>Moses nods. Okay...So, let's plan on a system that allows you to make a one or two part <br/>description, and you can add, edit, sort and delete those one or two parts. Sound good?<br/>GoI-Envoy Sae once overwrote parts of the mu by misusing +wear code.<br/>Aleriel oys<br/>Moth says "Ugh..."<br/>Moses laughs....in that dark, ugly sort of way.<br/>You say "Okay..2) What is the most desirable way to structure the commands that will be used<br/>in this system?"<br/>You say "This is the next thing I ask myself."<br/>You say "The reason for this is: You can do lots of smaller commands. Or one main command that <br/>has many switches."<br/>Moth says "What do you mean by structure, exactly?"<br/>Moth says "Oh okay..."<br/>You say "We could do +add +delete +edit +sort +puton as our series of commands."<br/>You say "Or we can do +wear/add +wear/delete ...etc."<br/>GoI-Envoy Sae likes the latter.<br/>Aleriel thinks +wear/whatever is easier to remember<br/>Moth would as well... as +delete and +edit might be commands somewhere else...<br/>Moses nods. As do I. Now, there are certainly instances where the former is going to be an<br/>easier way to do it.<br/>Moses nods to what Moth said.<br/>You say "Precisely."<br/>Moth says "That's how you end up overwriting stuff... **shudder**"<br/>You say "An instance where the former method of doing things is better would be a chargen."<br/>You say "Chargens have a lot of very specific commands, so in a case like that, it's generally <br/>better to make lots of individual commands, rather than one big switched one."<br/>You say "Next. 3) What is the most efficient way for me to store the data that my code will<br/>use?"<br/>You say "Here's where we hit our first bit of code."<br/>You say "I spend most of the time before I dive into the guts of the system on this particular<br/>question."<br/>You say "The reason is, I'm going to make or break myself with this. If I choose to store my<br/>data in a very unwieldy way, it's going to be more difficult to code for, and therefore more <br/>prone to bugs."<br/>You say "Since we're designing a full system of commands that all acts on one shared bit of<br/>data, how we store it is important."<br/>You say "Parity set out some naming conventions for attributes in his classes, and they're <br/>especially valid here."<br/>GoI-Envoy Sae notes that she was overwriting stuff by putting the desc into the category title <br/>accidentally. And since the category title had a fixed number of characters, the characters<br/>were spilling out onto other stuff.<br/>Moses ahhs and nods. "Yes. One of the things we're going to get to in the code is <br/>error-trapping."<br/>Moth noddles<br/>You say "Robust coding is important when doing systems. Basic rule of programming is: The user <br/>never types what you expect them to"<br/>You say "By robust, I mean capable of dealing with whatever input is given it, even if to<br/>report an error."<br/>You say "Lots of code gets odd input and politely clunks to a grinding halt."<br/>You say "Now...back to the subject."<br/>You say "We should now decide what we're going to name our two parts."<br/>You say "The first part of a desc is usually the 'general' description, and in +wears has been <br/>classically called the 'gen'."<br/>You say "Any suggestions for the second part?"<br/>You say "Or for the first, for that matter?"<br/>GoI-Envoy Sae says "Base, for the first..."<br/>Aleriel uhhs, "I'm missing something. What parts are we talking about?"<br/>Moses nods. Good one. The base or basic description.<br/>GoI-Envoy Sae just gives what she's familiar with...I would call the second, if there's only <br/>going to be two, something like clothes.<br/>You say "The two parts that we can combine to make one desc."<br/>You say "If at any point I jump forward, feel free to lasso me."<br/>Aleriel says "Oh. Then yeah, I'd call it 'general' and 'clothes', too. Or something like<br/>that."<br/>Moses nods. I like 'base' and 'clothes'.<br/>Moth has seen both<br/>You say "Okay...so to group them together, we could name all of our attributes 'base-&lt;name&gt;'<br/>and 'clothes-&lt;name&gt;'"<br/>You say "WHere &lt;name&gt; is the name of the individual desc that the user has put in."<br/>You say "So, hypothetically we could have 'clothes-blueshirt' and 'base-wounded'"<br/>You say "Where the first is a desc of a blue shirt, and the second is a desc of the character <br/>when he/she/it is wounded."<br/>You say "Make sense?"<br/>Aleriel nods<br/>Moth nods...<br/>You say "Another capability we will have to give our code, going back to #1 is the ability to <br/>list and preview what descs the character has."<br/>You say "Moth, you probably remember the space2tilde/tilde2space from Parity's class, and <br/>Aleriel, you've probably seen it before in code?"<br/>You say "Saeran, what space2tilde is is a function that takes a list of words, with spaces <br/>between them, and changes the space to a ~ character."<br/>You say "THis would change: 1 2 3 to 1~2~3"<br/>Aleriel hasn't seen that, but she's done similar things.<br/>Moses nods...Okay. It's a concept more than a specific practice anyways.<br/>Moth nods... has an example on me...<br/>Moth sets Prospero down.<br/>Moses typically does space to - or _<br/>Prospero wiggles his way off of Moth and across the floor in search of raisins.<br/>You say "Is the ferret visual?"<br/>Moses grins.<br/>Moth says "Feel free to ex the ferret if you want to see code spam.."<br/>Moth says "Yep he is"<br/>Moses nods. Okay. Good.<br/>Moses forgot to ask you if you brought him. :)<br/>Moth offers Prospero a raisin.<br/><br/>{Post-lecture note: These are the two functions, also covered in Parity's codeclasses that<br/>I will refer to, subsequently.}<br/><br/>Moth's Prospero<br/>SPACE2TILDE-FN:edit(%0,%b,~)<br/>TILDE2SPACE-FN:edit(%0,~,%b)<br/><br/>Carnelia has arrived.<br/>Moses welcomes Carnelia.<br/>Moth waves to Carnelia...<br/>Aleriel wavey-waves<br/>You say "We're not too far in, Carnelia. What we're discussing now is how to store the data we <br/>will create with our +wear/multidescer."<br/>Carnelia wavies. :) "I'm sorry for disrupting the class."<br/>You say "NP."<br/>You say "Okay, on Prospero, the function I'm referring to is the space2tilde-fn"<br/>You say "Using that, we can allow for multiple word titles in our attributes."<br/>You say "So, what was clothes-blueshirt would become clothes-blue~shirt"<br/>You say "Which is good, visually, because the - separates the type of attr from its title<br/>and the ~ shows us it is a multi-word title."<br/>You say "So, we will plan on allowing for multiple-word titles(up to 255 characters, since<br/>that's all TInyMUSH allows, I believe), with this space2tilde function doing the grunt work<br/>for us."<br/>You say "Carnelia, we're discussing the planning stages of the system. I'm giving a list of <br/>questions I ask myself before I plunge into building the code."<br/>Carnelia nods.<br/>You say "Next question: 4) Is this for personal or global use?"<br/>You say "A lot of systems like econ, faction, chargen, etc...are global or at least zoned <br/>systems."<br/>You say "Multidescers can be either/or. Which way would you like to address this one for the <br/>purposes of this class? Personal or global?"<br/>You say "Global means we get to address the security issues involved in building for the entire <br/>mush, meaning powered objects, permissions, etc."<br/>Moth says "How about personal..."<br/>Moth says "Or whatever the standard is... I've seen more personal +wear than global"<br/>You say "Personal means we get to experiment with the structure of the code, and we can then <br/>later extrapolate the knowledge that we learned in a personal system to a larger scope."<br/>Moses recommends Personal for the purposes of this class, though I will be happy to field any <br/>global/security questions along the way.<br/>Aleriel hmms. "Could we discuss personal, but then go into differences between personal/global <br/>and security issues it implies?"<br/>Moth nods, that'd be great<br/>Moses couldn't have said it better himself, Aleriel, even though he tried. :)<br/>Aleriel preens :)<br/>Moth meant to vote for personal, not give an edict btb... laf... that's the cold medicine, I <br/>swear!<br/>You say "Okay, doing it for personal use softens the strength of this next question, but as far <br/>as coding practices go, it is an important one to address: 5) ufuns and side-effect functions<br/>vs. @commands."<br/>You say "It's really more about the side-effect functions versus the @commands."<br/>Moth nods<br/>You say "For those of you that don't know what side-effect functions are, they're almost a <br/>religious issue amongst coders and admin of MUSHes through the years."<br/>Aleriel personally prefers @commands for everything except setting attributes. Like, if you<br/>just need to list descs to the player, @pemit would work nicely. But for storing new descs,<br/>I think function-based code is better. Am I wrong? :)<br/>Moses nods to Aleriel. Right. The only side-effect function we'd have to really worry about<br/>here is set(), the use of which makes our job as coders about fifty percent easier.<br/>You say "However, there are side-effect functions such as create() dig() wipe() etc. that can<br/>do some very nasty things to certain databases when misused."<br/>You say "Fortunately we don't have to worry about them too much, but for other systems, such<br/>as a global room digging system, that they would come into play."<br/>You say "Okay, those are all the questions that I ask myself before I go charging into the<br/>guts of the code..."<br/>You say "Which is good, because that only took an hour."<br/>Moses grins. :)<br/>You say "So, I'll recap."<br/>You say "Quickly."<br/>You say "We first decided what capabilities we wanted our code to have. We decided on a <br/>multidescer that could display a one or two-part description, with the ability to add, edit, <br/>delete, list, and preview those parts that we have defined."<br/>You say "Next we decided how to structure the commands that we'd use. We decided the best way<br/>to do a system like +wear is to have switched commands. +wear/add +wear/delete +wear/list,<br/>etc."<br/>You say "Then we decided the way to store our data."<br/>You say "darn enter key."<br/>You say "We chose the terms base and clothes for the two parts of our description, and will <br/>include the space2tilde function to allow for multiple word names of individual elements."<br/>You say "Then, we decided this is for personal use, and we will use side-effect functions, as <br/>necessary."<br/>You say "Great."<br/>You say "I agree with Parity's hands-on idea of coding, so if you all want to @create an object <br/>and uselock it to yourself, we can start."<br/><br/>Armoire created.<br/>Locked.<br/>Set.<br/><br/>You say "And make sure to set your object 'commands'"<br/>You say "As well, visual is nice, so that we can all look at each other's code."<br/><br/>{post-lecture note: Right after I said this, I completely forgot to set it on my own object.}<br/><br/>Parity stirs in its slumber mumbling something about objeval() and then goes back to sleep. ;)<br/>Moses grins at Parity. Precisely.<br/>Moth chuckles<br/>Aleriel finished with creating an object, "Now I'm ready :)"<br/>Prospero has left.<br/>Moth calls Prospero and waits to be pounced.<br/>You say "Okay, since we've chosen the format of a switched command, the best thing to do is<br/>set up our 'big' commands first."<br/>You say "We can set up our commands now, with the plan to farm the work of the code out to<br/>ufuns that we will code later."<br/>You say "Now, if we think about the list of capabilities we have, there are two forms our<br/>+wear command is going to take: +wear/* * and +wear/* *=*"<br/>You say "The first one is for +wear/delete &lt;name&gt; +wear/preview &lt;name&gt; for instance."<br/>GoI-Envoy Sae says "Where name is the name of a particular desc in one of the two categories?"<br/>Moses nods. Precisely, Sae.<br/>You say "Of course, we hit a slight bump. What if you have both a base and a clothes of the<br/>same name?"<br/>You say "Suggestions?"<br/>GoI-Envoy Sae mutters, "Don't allow it. Because coding around that just makes the command<br/>harder to use."<br/>Moses nods. That is one good suggestion.<br/>Aleriel says "do +wear/* */*"<br/>Moses nods. That's the other one.<br/>GoI-Envoy Sae mphs. "See...that seems bad to me."<br/>Aleriel says "Or do it the easy way - +wear/* *-* :P"<br/>You say "It's a matter of functionality. How versatile do you want to make your system."<br/>GoI-Envoy Sae says "Too darn complicated. :p"<br/>You say "*/* or *-* or *^* or *booger* is of little matter..."<br/>GoI-Envoy Sae would rather be able to do a +wear greenshirt and have it /know/ that greenshirt<br/>is in the 'clothes' category.<br/>Aleriel says "depends.. you could still have just * and then all you'd have to do is use %0 as <br/>attribute name you're looking for"<br/>Parity . o O ( +wear/* *=* )<br/>You say "Holy cow! We have bleachers!"<br/>Moses grins.<br/>You say "Yes, the other thing is to simplify two commands into one of +wear/* *=*."<br/>You say "This covers all situations that we're planning for except one."<br/>GoI-Envoy Sae gets lost. :)<br/>You say "The only thing we'll have to make an exception for is +wear-list"<br/>You say "Er, +wear/list"<br/>You say "Which is easily coded as a separate command."<br/>You say "And is the one I was going to suggest our starting with, anyways."<br/>You say "Does anyone else have an argument or question for +wear/* *=*?"<br/>Aleriel says "we could do +wear/list like that, too.."<br/>You say "+wear/list base and +wear/list clothes?"<br/>Aleriel says "like, +wear/list base=blah, or +wear/list clothes=all"<br/>You say "Oh, I see."<br/>Aleriel says "'all' meaning that all descs would be listed. We'd run into a problem of having<br/>a desc with that name, though"<br/>Moses nods...which would be something we couldn't allow.<br/>Parity's solution on its multidescer was to make the list command just '+wear' (well, '.desc' <br/>but... )<br/>Moses nods. Right. The command with no arguments produces the most generic output.<br/>Aleriel nods..<br/>Moses outputted the +help file when people did that with his. ;)<br/>You say "Each specific implementation is going to be specific to the MUSH, the coder, and the <br/>needs of the system."<br/>You say "For the purposes of this class, I suggest we have a separate +wear/list command, with <br/>the structure of +wear/* *=* for the other capabilities."<br/>You say "If you want to do it another way, I'll be happy to go into that...However, I'm<br/>striving for least common denominator."<br/>You say "It's easier to make it easy now and hard later than hard now, and excruciating later. <br/>:)"<br/>Aleriel says "that works for me :)"<br/>Moses nods. Okay, so let's get into +wear/list.<br/>You say "We know it needs to pemit three things: 1) The two categories 2) The listing of names<br/>in each category 3) the command you need to type in order to either get more help, or preview<br/>one of those names."<br/>You say "Any other suggestions?"<br/>Aleriel shakes her head, "Not really"<br/>Moses passes the hat around.<br/>Parity drops a quarter in it. ;)<br/>Moses woo's! I can afford that Jag I've been saving for!<br/>Moses ahems.<br/>Aleriel says "Oh, a question: where are we storing the descs? on the object or the player?"<br/>Moth is a code newbie. I could give suggestions, but they might not be conducive to stuff <br/>working;)<br/>Moth is the Timmy of Coding... for those of you who watch South Park<br/>You say "Ahh! Aleriel hit something I should have covered in the original questions."<br/>Moses thwaps self in head.<br/>Moth nods...gets back to class<br/>You say "Okay, personally, I recommend objects. Reason: A lot of players(and admin) find <br/>themselves ex'ing the player a lot. This gets quite spammy if you have multi-line descriptions <br/>stored on your character."<br/>Aleriel nods<br/>Parity stirs...<br/>Moses whisks.<br/>You say "There are issues with doing it on an objct."<br/>Parity says "Objects makes it harder to globalize the code later without introducing MR <br/>inefficiency."<br/>Aleriel says "MR?"<br/>Parity says "Master Room."<br/>Moses nods...Parity beat me to it.<br/>Aleriel says "Oh"<br/>You say "It is an extra function that has to be called for each and every command done with<br/>+wear to put it on an object. However, for personal use, which is what we're planning this<br/>for, it is a 50/50 issue."<br/>You say "All those in favour of putting the data on an obj, say so?"<br/>Aleriel says "works for me"<br/>GoI-Envoy Sae shrugs...<br/>Aleriel says "doesn't really matter right now.."<br/>You say "Moth? Carnelia?"<br/>Moth is cool with it<br/>Moses shrugs. It doesn't matter now. There are global issues, as Parity said, with doing it<br/>on an object. But, we're coding for personal use.<br/>Moth nods, and it's just an example anyhoo... but it's good to know why -not- to do a thing a <br/>certain way... and how -not- to do it;)... (altho, usually I discover that on my own;p)<br/>Moses grins. Mistakes are the best teachers. :)<br/>Moth grins<br/>You say "Okay, so with the code on an object, we only need to have one basic test for our <br/>+wear/list command. Does the player/object triggering this code have permission to see this <br/>list?"<br/>You say "&amp;cmd-list &lt;obj&gt;=$+wear/list:@switch controls(%#,me)=0,{@pemit %#=You can't do <br/>that!}....would be the beginning."<br/>You say "Yes, my name conventions are opposite from parity's. I have cmd-&lt;name&gt; and fn-&lt;name&gt;"<br/>You say "For the purposes of this class, I don't really want to get into the best way to code <br/>graphical headers, and pretty ansi displays. That's a whole other set of classes."<br/>Parity nods. "The prevailing argument is it lets you group things by type... my argument is I <br/>never want to group things by type, but by category. ie, *wear not *cmd. It -really- doesn't <br/>matter unless you're decompiling large objects into files.

"That's what I told Moses. But it was fun anyhow. Laters." :)<br/>GoI-Envoy Sae has left.<br/>You say "Okay, Moth I know you know iter(), since it was covered in the second codeclass I <br/>believe, yes?"<br/>You say "Carnelia, do you know what iter() does?"<br/>Carnelia says "I don't want to slow down the pace of the class /that/ much... and it would be <br/>much. :)"<br/>Moses chuckles.<br/>Carnelia says "I'm afraid not."<br/>Moth nods, knows the basics... in that I've seen it and can now read the help files;)<br/>You say "Well we only have 15 minutes left, so I will try to explain as much as I can, while<br/>not going into minute detail.

And the ## means?<br/>You say "The ## is the way you reference each object in the list. The first time through,<br/>it's 1, then it's 2, then it's 3. ## just means 'item in list I'm working on currently'"<br/>Carnelia says "Thank you."<br/>You say "lattr() lists the names of the attributes on an object."<br/>Moth nods, makes sense<br/>You say "You can narrow your search by telling it to look for attributes that start off with,<br/>in this case, base-*. We use the * because it's a 'wildcard', meaning that it could be<br/>anything."<br/>Moth nods, follows...<br/>You say "So if we have attributes named base-1, base-2, and base-3, lattr(obj/base-*) is going<br/>to return the list: base-1 base-2 base-3 and ignore the rest of the attributes on the object."<br/>You say "You can do lattr(obj) and get a list of every attribute on an object, or you can<br/>narrow your search. It's like doing a keyword search on a website."<br/>You say "So, the iter goes through the list produced by the lattr(), and passes each member<br/>of the list into the function called fn-showname"<br/>Moth nods...<br/>You say "It is passed into the function as %0."<br/>You say "The after() function takes %0, and returns everything after the - in the string."<br/>You say "So, it's after(%0,-), and %0 is something like base-dirty, it will take what's after<br/>the '-' and give you back the word 'dirty'"<br/>Moth nods, cool<br/>You say "Since we've decided to allow for multiple word titles, there is the possibility that<br/>we will have tildes in our name. We might get back dirty~wounded."<br/>You say "So, to account for that, we send what the after() gives us to the tilde2space function <br/>that Parity showed us in its classes."<br/>Moth hmms...lags<br/>Moses did too.<br/>You say "the tilde2space function does: edit(%0,~,%b) and what that does is find every<br/>occurrence of ~ in the string, and replace it with a space(%b)"<br/>You say "Again, the data is passed to the function as %0"<br/>You say "So, all of that comes back to our cmd-list, and is displayed."<br/>Moth nods...gets it...<br/>You say "Parity or Aleriel probably see the potential bug I've given myself in the output of <br/>this, and we will discuss that at the next class."<br/>Moth woos....<br/>Moth appreciates you scripting that out...<br/>Moses nods. No problem.<br/>Parity stopped paying attention awhile ago actually, sorry. ;o<br/>Parity says "Angel is on, you see... ;)"<br/>Moth lafs<br/>Aleriel wonders, "When's the next class? :)"<br/>Moth says "Oh that's right. It's Buffy Night for Parity"<br/>Moses laughs. Oh, it's just an iter'ed list that I'm outputting words with spaces from.<br/>You say "I'd like to do them once a week, if that's okay with everyone else?"<br/>Moth would you like to pick it back up next Tuesday?<br/>Moses nods. Sounds good.<br/>Aleriel nodnods. "Works for me"<br/>Moth says "Was 5PM Pacific a good time?"<br/>Moses nods. Yep. Next time, I make dinner /before/ class, though. ;)<br/>Moth grins, ditto<br/>Parity oh, yeah. "Sepchar. help iter() will solve it in five seconds. ;)"<br/>Moses nods. Bingo. On the nosey.<br/>You say "Everyone read help iter() to learn about separation characters. :)"<br/>Moth will post the announcement of part2 tonight....<br/>Moses nods. Coolio.<br/>Parity is probably going to do list manipulation in the next class.<br/>Moses woo's.<br/>Aleriel grins<br/>Carnelia says "I'll try to be here. Parity, is information on your code class logs in the +bbs <br/>somewhere? I haven't caught up on those yet."<br/>Parity says "Had a talk with Cho Chang today about some stuff and realized that was a big hole<br/>in what I'm covering."<br/>You say "http://members.fortunecity.com/ogr/codeclass101.txt, codeclass201.txt and <br/>mushcode202.txt"<br/>Moth says "What will you attempt to do next class specifically? // The logs are up on the OGR <br/>site, Carnelia, under "Resources"..."<br/>Aleriel would really like to hear about security issues of global code and the like :)<br/>Moth nods, would as well<br/>Parity says "My logs are on my webpage at http://www.angelfire.com/linux/parity/ and OGR's <br/>webpage at... uhm... what moses said."<br/>Moth is going to head out for now and wash dishes...<br/>You say "Okay, the next class is going to specifically cover the structure of the +wear<br/>command, and how to take advantage of u-functions."<br/>Moth nods, groovy<br/>Parity will be doing more with iter() and also first(), rest(), before(), after(), setunion(), <br/>setdiff(), member().... :)<br/>Parity says "Just... list manipulation. :)"<br/>Moth nods, groovies on that as well...<br/>Aleriel says "Cool"<br/>You say "And ldelete(), replace(), insert(), remove() are fun too. ;)"<br/>Moth nods, thanks Moses for the class and his patience;)... and heads off to do dishes<br/>Carnelia wavies.<br/>Moses waves and stops the log.<br/><br/>
