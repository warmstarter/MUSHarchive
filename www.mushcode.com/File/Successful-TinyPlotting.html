        Topic: Successful Tinyplotting<br/>Author: Octavian, et al<br/>Summary: Octavian organized a small, but exceptionally informative seminar<br/>about the management of TinyPlots.<br/><br/>Thursday, April 01, 1999<br/><br/>Octavian waves. "Hail there. The topics I've got right now are: <br/><br/>   how much planning should be done (open ended/closed ended),<br/>   predicting success and failure of plots in different ways,<br/>   how much you need to tell people involved a plot,<br/>   plotting on the fly, <br/>   ownership of plot authoring, <br/>   plotting for various numbers of players,<br/>   overlapping/sequel plotting, <br/>   features and temporary characters,<br/>   and advertising, <br/><br/>  ... not really in that order, and whatever else comes up. Anything else to<br/>add right off the bat? :)"<br/>Octavian wonders if starting in about 5 minutes is good for people.<br/><br/>Brody says, "Works for me."<br/>Killa nods.<br/>Marretta says, "Okay with me!"<br/>Nova nods<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Okay, folks. Can I have your attention please."<br/><br/>Brody swivels his chair so he can look at Trispis. It squeaks. Just a little.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Octavian and I have decided that I'll moderate, rather than be<br/>an unspecified panelist (I volunteered to make sure he'd have some people, but<br/>it seems that's no longer necessary.). Instructions to follow..."<br/>Trispis says, "First: @chan/on 101"<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Nova has joined this channel.<br/>&lt;101&gt; Brody has joined this channel.<br/>&lt;101&gt; Killa has joined this channel.<br/>&lt;101&gt; kalouri has joined this channel.<br/>&lt;101&gt; Octavian has joined this channel.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "If you're here as a panelist/speaker, please page me with your<br/>topic."<br/>Trispis says, "er... topic/expertise/interest/etc."<br/><br/>David flips his name the right way around.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Next, please use the +101 chat channel to raise your hand for<br/>speaking or whatever."<br/>Trispis says, "It will make it a whole lot easier to edit the log if you use<br/>the channel for such things."<br/><br/>Brody nods<br/>Killa noddles.<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Skyflight has joined this channel.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Okay. I think I've got everyone accounted for (at least<br/>nominally)."<br/>Trispis says, "Next, I'd like to thank Octavian for putting this all together.<br/> This is a first of sorts for 101, in that someone actually volunteered to<br/>hold a presentation. I'm very grateful for that. It's also a first in another<br/>respect: It's our first Roleplay oriented presentation. Being a coder, I can<br/>only apologize for it taking this long to get an RP presentation to occur. <br/>Thanks again, Oct. This sorta rounds out the 101 purpose."<br/>Trispis says, "Some of the presenters have asked if I have any order I intend<br/>to introduce them. The answer is: Yes. Randomly."<br/><br/>Killa grins.<br/>Brody chuckles<br/>David says, "Clever."<br/>Grinna smiles<br/>kalouri says, "Bold move"<br/>Nova grynz<br/><br/>Trispis says, "I'll give most of them a break, though, and begin with the<br/>instigator of this mess. So... let's give a warm welcome to Octavian, former<br/>troublemaker on CDI and current god of COE. Octavian... the floor is yours. <br/>(Remember, folks: Raise your hand and stuff on +101)."<br/><br/>Kyieren applauds as Octavian takes the floor.<br/>Killa claps.<br/>Brody claps as well<br/><br/>Octavian says, "Thanks for that brutally honest introduction. :)"<br/>Octavian says, "The purpose of this discussion is to, hopefully, share what we<br/>have learned from plotting experience, as well as give some guidance to people<br/>new to tinyplotting (TPing). To start heading in that direction, I'd like to<br/>do a brief, if overly academic, introduction on TPs and their importance."<br/>Octavian says, "Also, as I'm typing this and my hands don't always connect to<br/>my thoughts, if I say something that doesn't parse, you can just page me and<br/>I'll fix it. :)"<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Trispis says, "In order to get all of the presentations done in a timely<br/>manner, I'll be moving from one presentation to the next. After all of the<br/>presentations have been given, we can open the floor to semi-organized<br/>questions/answers, eventually moving toward unmoderated discussion, depending<br/>on how long people stay."<br/><br/>Octavian says, "Marshall McLuhan, the famous and celebrated media theorist,<br/>noted that, in any given medium, the content itself is always *another*<br/>medium. For example, the content of the daily paper is news, and the content<br/>of the billboard is advertising."<br/>Octavian says, "MUSHes, in their way, are themselves a new mass medium. Most<br/>are open to anyone who would wish to access them, they have content, and they<br/>reach an audience that spans distance and time."<br/>Octavian says, "Therefore, in keeping with McLuhan's theory, it can be said<br/>that the content of the MUSH is often the story."<br/>Octavian says, "On M*U*S*H, that story is your real life story. :) But on many<br/>other MUSHes, those stories are ones we roleplay. The story arcs that move<br/>through that roleplay are TinyPlots."<br/>Octavian says, "In particular, today's discussion will be about how to create<br/>those stories, and by doing so, how to guide the content for this medium. <br/>Thanks for reading my incredibly slow typing, and I hope you enjoy the rest. <br/>:)"<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Octavian is done.<br/>&lt;101&gt; Trispis nods.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Thanks, Oct. If I must say so myself, that presents a nice<br/>canvas on which we can discuss the more intricate details."<br/>Trispis says, "As a long-time champion of newbies and underdogs, I must say<br/>that the newbie, in general, can throw obstacles into the best organized TP. <br/>So, without further ado, I'd like to get the 'newbie issue' placed onto this<br/>fine canvas of discussion. Everyone give a warm welcome to Killa..."<br/><br/>Killa grins and stands.<br/><br/>David claps.<br/>Brody claps.<br/>Grinna applauds. :)<br/>Marretta welcomes warmly.<br/>Nova applauds "Go girl!"<br/>kalouri joins the applause<br/><br/>Killa says, "Thank you. First off we should define exactly what a newbie is to<br/>a mush. Newbies are players who generally have little to no experience with<br/>MUSHing and specifically your mush. Before a newbie even enters ICdom, they<br/>should be aware and familiar with the important aspects. If you have a combat<br/>system, they should know how to use it effectively. They should have already<br/>met the TP Coordinator and the tpstaff. On Star Wars:Galaxy's Edge, we have a<br/>newbie tpstaffer. That's what this person does all day, everyday...but I<br/>digress...."<br/>Killa says, "There are horror stories about newbies that sat in the bar all<br/>day. I know, I've been one:) Newbies are the lifeblood of a mush. Tpstaff<br/>should have any number of generic tps that can be implemented with little<br/>fuss. Ever hear of the Flaming Winnebago that's prone to being burned down by<br/>some shady character? Surprise them. Not only does this buy time for tpstaff<br/>to integrate them into the current tp but it helps the newbie to connect to<br/>the other players...."<br/>Killa says, "Now of course is the question many Tplotters deal with:How to<br/>successfully integrate the newbie into the tp. Depending on the format and<br/>theme, this can be entirely too easy or as hard as chewing on a boulder. My<br/>personal experience has been on faction based MUSHes so therefore there is<br/>always a good fight to be had somewhere. For those that stress an ongoing<br/>storyline where there is little opportunity for direct physical conflict, I<br/>find having a TPchar who just LOVES to 'help' the new char out by telling them<br/>the latest gossip serves the same purpose. However you do it, it is important<br/>to remember that it needs to happen pretty quickly. Don't let your newbies<br/>wait weeks before finding them. They'll leave and word of mouth kills...."<br/>Killa steps down and takes her seat.<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Killa is done.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Thank you, Killa."<br/><br/>Nova clapclaps<br/>Brody claps<br/>Marretta applauds, on behalf of newbies everywhere.<br/>kalouri waves a newbie over her head and cheers.<br/>Brody grins at Kal<br/>Killa acks and faints!<br/>David cheers.<br/>Dyason exclaims "Put me down!"<br/>Grinna LOL<br/>Killa shakes her head and smiles.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "I'm sitting here looking at the topics of the final two<br/>presenters, and I'm having a hard time deciding which to have next/last. I<br/>think the obvious choice is to have an overview/summary last. So, without<br/>further ado, let's give a warm welcome to kalouri..."<br/><br/>Nova applauds<br/><br/>Brody golf claps<br/>Killa claps.<br/>Grinna staps her feet and applauds.<br/><br/>kalouri stands and smiles, then smirks at Brody.<br/><br/>Knighthawke claps<br/><br/>kalouri says, "Actually, I think the previous topic flows rather well into<br/>this one. I'm the RP coordinator at OtherSpace, the original theme science<br/>fiction MUSH that Brody started. Newbies get a double whammy on an original<br/>MUSH, because not only do they have to learn commands, they have to learn all<br/>about a new universe that doesn't have 20 or 30 years of commercial canon<br/>information out in the public marketplace. So, one thing that we do to help<br/>ease people into the game and to encourage their participation in TPs and<br/>longer story arcs, is the use of feature characters and NPCs. Some of the best<br/>hold position like bartender, or clothier, or a private investigator, for<br/>example. It's easy for these characters to chat with a newbie, giving them<br/>information ICly rather than sitting in the OOC area, trying to explain what's<br/>been going on."<br/>kalouri says, "It has also helped, because of the original theme, to begin the<br/>game with NPCs in certain positions of power: The Stellar Consortium<br/>president, the Vanguard military Commander in Chief, etc. They help establish<br/>a precedent that will eventually be used to encourage a PC to rise through the<br/>ranks to replace them. In fact, we're proud to say we're in the process of<br/>electing a PC president in the wake of an incredibly nasty cloning scandal<br/>during the most recent story arc (long story, check it out sometime). But this<br/>is an important step. The MUSH has been around for nearly a year, and it's<br/>time now for the handoff. The power goes from the NPCs to the PCs, because now<br/>they have enough knowledge and understanding of the universe to fill the role.<br/>That leaves us more time to focus on smaller fish NPCs, like the bartenders,<br/>or new challenges, like new races. Or new political situations. All kinds of<br/>nasty stuff."<br/>kalouri says, "On a bookkeeping note, if you manage a multitude of NPCs (we<br/>have three regions of space on OS, so they add up), it is an excellent idea to<br/>keep notes built into the characters - bios, distinguishing characteristics.<br/>Not only can you forget the nuances of an NPC, but no one can be on all the<br/>time, and sometimes another director may pick up where you left off. It's good<br/>to give them a road map."<br/>kalouri says, "That concludes my presentation, such as it is. I'll be glad to<br/>answer questions later. Thank you. :)"<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Trispis says, "identify the strings to the puppet. Interesting. (:"<br/><br/>kalouri returns to her seat.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Thank you, kalouri."<br/><br/>Killa claps and waves an NPC over her head.<br/>kalouri ROFL<br/>Marretta ducks and claps.<br/>Brody cheers<br/>Grinna applauds<br/>Nova clapclaps!!<br/>Knighthawke chuckles.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Our final speaker is Brody (who got an indirect intro during<br/>kalouri's presentation, so I won't say much here). Let's welcome Brody..."<br/><br/>Brody nods, then stands.<br/><br/>Killa applauds and puts the NPC down.<br/>David claps, a bit late.<br/>Knighthawke claps.<br/>Nova claps for Brody<br/>kalouri raspberries...in a very respectful and polite way, mind you.<br/>Killa heehees and blueberries.<br/><br/>Brody says, "I'll keep my intro brief: As Kal noted, I'm the creator of<br/>OtherSpace MUSH. I'm going to discuss plotting - open ended/closed-ended. <br/>That sort of thing. It's a topic rather near and dear to my heart, and<br/>probably an unhealthy obsession, but I have a great time doing it...so, there<br/>ya go."<br/>Brody says, "Even before Kal helped me get OS off the ground, we did TPs on<br/>other MU**es. We've carried over a philosophy from the early days that still<br/>applies where we're at now. It's pretty much the same theory as most generals<br/>follow when discussing strategy: Every plan for attack is effective until you<br/>actually commence the attack, then you throw the plan out the window. But<br/>first, at least, you have a plan."<br/><br/>kalouri laughs<br/>Killa grins.<br/>David says, "Good plan."<br/>Killa watches the plan die as it splats on the ground. "poor Plan."<br/><br/>Brody says, "I plan on a *big* scale, currently. I've drafted basic plotlines<br/>for eight story arcs so far on OtherSpace. We are commencing the third this<br/>weekend. Each arc lasts about three months. A lot happens during each arc,<br/>most of it ultimately interwoven together in some way so that it brings the<br/>maximum number of people together at the end."<br/>Brody says, "When I plot, I have a definite idea of how I want to start, a<br/>solid idea of what the climactic event should be, and a lot of flexibility on<br/>how it actually shakes out in the end. If I don't have that flexibility, I<br/>*will* snap. Because newbies, while posing a challenge on the front-end, don't<br/>present near the challenge that a veteran PC who has *been* through one of my<br/>arcs before poses. They are creative and intelligent people, and they'll think<br/>of some wrinkle to throw at me. Frankly, those curve balls they throw that I<br/>don't expect are what really keep me hopping. I love flying by the seat of my<br/>pants with RP creation at times like that."<br/>Brody says, "Now, as I said, in the big plan, I know how I want to start and<br/>where the climax should be, and a general idea of how it ends. The PCs, I<br/>prefer, determine specifically how it ends, through their actions."<br/>Brody says, "If I dictate everything, then I'm nothing but a puppet master,<br/>and not an interactive storyteller. I need their interaction to complete the<br/>story."<br/>Brody says, "Within the big arcs, of course, we've got to have smaller TPs,<br/>just to keep the action moving. It doesn't even have to be arc-related. It can<br/>be monster-of-the-week. A bounty hunt. Anything. Just to keep them busy and<br/>entertained and in the habit of RP."<br/>Brody says, "With smaller TPs, I try to set up situations and characters for<br/>the PCs to deal with. I don't *plan* these so much as sit down and say: Ok,<br/>we'll establish that a bounty is out on this guy, and turn the PCs loose to<br/>catch him/her/it."<br/>Brody says, "The smaller TPs are extremely loosely scripted on OS, if for no<br/>other reason than to give the RP coordinator a break from the more rigid<br/>details I demand of her in the arc events."<br/>Brody says, "If you are blessed to have very good RPers, they will often come<br/>up with their own plot ideas, break into small groups, and do things amongst<br/>themselves. We encourage that, and we encourage them to generate ideas that<br/>they can share with others. That also lightens the load for the RP<br/>coordinator. Occasionally, you get a kook who only wants to do something for<br/>his own glory, but that's another reason to have the RP coordinator around: to<br/>weed that out, and help encourage that player to dream up something with<br/>broader vision."<br/>Brody says, "That does it for me. Thanks for listening."<br/>Brody smiles and takes his seat.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Thank you, Brody."<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; David says, "Kooks are bad."<br/>&lt;101&gt; Trispis wants all the glory for himself.<br/>&lt;101&gt; David holds up his hand.<br/>&lt;101&gt; Octavian says, "Too many kooks spoil the broth."<br/>&lt;101&gt; David hehe.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Before I open the floor to questions, I'd like to make an<br/>observation."<br/>Trispis says, "As I was reading Brody's presentation, I got the impression<br/>that he and kalouri work together nicely as a team. *pauses briefly for<br/>confirmation*"<br/><br/>Brody nods. "Yep."<br/><br/>Trispis nods and continues...<br/><br/>kalouri says, "I hate him SOOO much"<br/><br/>Brody ponders a scattergun<br/>Killa heehees.<br/>Nova heheehehs<br/>Grinna bol<br/>Knighthawke smiles wryly and chuckles.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "This brings to mind my own experience with MUSH101 and more<br/>recently here on M*U*S*H. Our successes came about through supportive<br/>teamwork. I, like Brody, tend to be the central figure, often the most<br/>acknowledged individual. However, the success of our ventures (as I assume so<br/>for OS, too) depend on supportive cooperation."<br/><br/>Brody nods. "Absolutely."<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; David says, "(This is what's called 'sucking up to the people who work<br/>for you, so you don't have to pay them anything. :)"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "I'll not digress into the details and mutual admirations that<br/>could stem from that comment, but I do feel it's crucial to any successful<br/>venture (online or off)."<br/><br/>Brody smiles and nods<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Trispis says, "Stop giving me a way, David."<br/>&lt;101&gt; Brody chuckles<br/>&lt;101&gt; Knighthawke grins<br/>&lt;101&gt; David says, "I wouldn't, but you forgot to suck up to me."<br/><br/>kalouri says, "True enough."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "That being said, I'll move directly to the question/answer<br/>phase and begin with David (who had the first question, but hasn't asked it),<br/>then move to Skyflight's question."<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; David says, "Alright, I forgot my oher question, but I have a different<br/>one."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Ask away..."<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Professor Raevnos raises his hand.<br/><br/>David asks here, to confuse things, "Brody, you said you already did two<br/>'story arcs' on OS...can you give an example of one of them...and the ways it<br/>could have ended up, and the way it did, and what went weird..." (big<br/>question, huh?)<br/><br/>Brody nods. "Well, probably best to talk about the most complicated arc, which<br/>we just finished a few weeks ago."<br/>Brody says, "The most recent arc, titled "Walls Fall Down," had one general<br/>goal: To turn everything upside down and topsy turvy. Old conventions were<br/>shattered, empires fell apart, heroes became, at one time or another,<br/>villains."<br/>Brody says, "Now, let's focus specifically on events in the Consortium, to<br/>simplify things."<br/>Brody says, "The biggest deal in the whole arc for the Consortium was the<br/>discovery that the president, the Vanguard CinC and a world government had<br/>been involved in a scheme to clone warriors to use against potential enemies. <br/>This was in violation of a 400 year old treaty, yadayadayada, very bad thing<br/>to do. How I wanted it to work out was for my NPC, General Dimitri Volstov<br/>(the CinC) to end up on trial for his crimes, very publicly. What really<br/>happened, when the PCs got into the mix, was that he ended up dead. Now,<br/>Volstov was a bad, bad man. I loved playing him. Hated to let him go. But,<br/>that's the way that particular NPC crumbled."<br/>Brody says, "He died for the greater glory of RP - many folks were involved,<br/>it led to a court martial for one PC who wound up kicked out of the Vanguard<br/>for it. So, a twist I didn't expect, but we all enjoyed."<br/>Brody is done.<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; kalouri says, "What he's not saying is that he was an emotional wreck<br/>for about a week. Volstov was a real mean and nasty and very cathartic to play<br/>;)"<br/>&lt;101&gt; Trispis chuckles.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Thanks again, Brody."<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Brody says, "I immediately started playing Garunth. He's a reptiloid<br/>Zangali, eight feet tall and mean by genetics"<br/>&lt;101&gt; Brody says, "I got over it quick!"<br/><br/>Brody nods<br/><br/>David says, "Thanks."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Skyflight posed this dilemma earlier. I found it very<br/>interesting at the time, and upon re-reading it I see it as being very<br/>reminescent of some (many?) of my RP experiences. (question to follow)"<br/><br/>Skyflight says, "Well, I just wanted to comment briefly that what was missing<br/>at all MUSHes I've been too is a reliable objective IC history of the MUSH,<br/>after it's started. All the MUSHes I've seen have a news history, but nothing<br/>after the opening day. An objective record helps players relate the events to<br/>their characters, see it through their eyes. It helps the newbies see the flow<br/>of events better, and get used to the style of the MUSH. And that can lead to<br/>some TP ideas too I feel, if people can look back and say "Oh that's right, we<br/>have this loose thread, let's do something with that.""<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; kalouri is helping a newbie. Can you take that, Bro?<br/>&lt;101&gt; Brody nods to Kal<br/><br/>Trispis notes...<br/>Trispis says, "Skyflight didn't really care who addressed it. It was more of a<br/>'food for thought' statement. However, I'd like to know how OS deals with this<br/>issue, because B &amp; k seem to have their s#!+ together."<br/><br/>Brody says, "I think it's vital that people be capable of being brought up to<br/>speed on past events as rapidly as possible. Otherwise, it's like tuning in to<br/>Babylon 5 in the middle of the Shadow War and going - HUH? I want people to be<br/>able to check out what has gone before. So, I regularly update our web page<br/>(www.otherspace.org), to reflect the current year and status of the<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; kalouri whews. "We've got him snowed, Bro" ;)<br/><br/>Brody says, "But I also want guests who are just logging on to be able to<br/>check it out too."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Do you maintain any on-MUSH history? Or is it all web-based?"<br/><br/>Brody says, "So, we've got an archive of +help files. Some are extensive<br/>summaries of the arcs that have been completed. Then I have two, so far (for<br/>the years 2650 and 2651) which are quick thumbnail sketches of events."<br/><br/>Brody says, "On MUSH too"<br/><br/>Trispis nods.<br/><br/>Brody says, "The +help files are almost always more up to date than the web<br/>page, although the web page isn't too far behind"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "I think this probably works very similar (on a larger scale) to<br/>the NPC stat info k mentioned earlier."<br/><br/>Brody nods. "Exactly."<br/><br/>Trispis nods.<br/><br/>Skyflight says, "If I may, one complication of that is that new players may<br/>have trouble keeping OOC and IC info seperate. They may not realize that their<br/>character may not know all of this info."<br/><br/>kalouri says, "It's good to remember that some people want extensive<br/>background, some only want to get the gist. You have to offer both."<br/><br/>Brody says, "They might certainly know a lot of it. And I need to trust the<br/>players to keep them separate."<br/>Brody says, "So far, it hasn't been a problem."<br/><br/>Trispis nods to Brody, "IC vs OOC info is always the responsibility of the<br/>player."<br/><br/>Brody acks<br/><br/>Trispis pokes around the room... anyone else have a question/comment/opinion?<br/><br/>Skyflight says, "On any TP-related topic?"<br/><br/>Trispis nods.<br/><br/>Skyflight says, "I'd like to note that maintaining a stable TP staff is always<br/>difficult. It seems to me that if someone gets the job, they pretty much keep<br/>it, regardless of whether they are qualified to run TPs, or to manage their<br/>underlings. How does eveyone keep this from becoming a problem?"<br/><br/>Trispis reiterates his earlier comments about effective teams. I really don't<br/>know of any other successful means.<br/><br/>Brody nods. "I agree with Trispis there. Kal and I were a team before OS.<br/>We've added people to our RP team who are enthusiastic RPers and good<br/>teamworkers."<br/>Brody says, "In other words, we *don't* put that in the hands of just anyone."<br/><br/>Octavian says, "I find that the whole issue of maintaining a staff is greatly<br/>simplified when there's one person who everyone else answers to."<br/><br/>Brody nods.<br/>Brody says, "Too many cooks..."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "If you select someone for a task and no one can stand to work<br/>with them, they're obviously not doing you any good. This is an example of the<br/>*wrong* end of the spectrum. Your leaders (admins, coordinators, whatever you<br/>call them) need to be good with people."<br/><br/>Skyflight says, "What point is it appropriate to issue warnings and eventually<br/>fire a staffer who doesn't fit those catagories?"<br/><br/>Brody hmms. "Seems like that can apply anywhere, not just RP admins."<br/><br/>Trispis nods to Oct. On M*U*S*H, some newbies often mistake me for the main<br/>admin here simply because I have no offline life (thus, I'm here about 16<br/>hours a day). But, I do answer (as do all of the admins) to just one person:<br/>Javlin. And no one answers to me.<br/><br/>Brody says, "When you as a leader see someone going astray and hear people<br/>grumbling, better take that person aside and discuss it. If that doesn't fix<br/>things, issue warnings."<br/><br/>Skyflight says, "True, but it's been my experience that TP staffers are the<br/>ones who last the longest in positions they aren't qualified for."<br/><br/>Octavian says, "Generally, if you're in charge of the hiring and firing,<br/>you're also the one who can make the big decisions. Just keep overruling their<br/>decisions and eventually they'll either make better decisions or quit. :)"<br/><br/>Brody nods to Octavian.<br/><br/>Octavian says, "But it means being highly reactive, which can be more tiring<br/>than being proactive sometimes."<br/><br/>kalouri says, "Amen"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "I think I see a different point that Skyflight is making...]"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "I'm reminded of +admin/all"<br/>Trispis says, "We have 11 admins listed here, only about 5 of which are even<br/>remotely active."<br/><br/>Grinna nods.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "The point being: Who are those wizards and royals? I never see<br/>them. I have no idea what they do, but they seem to be hogging a position that<br/>some *active* person could fill."<br/>Trispis says, "Javlin is recently addressing these issues (for the 2nd or 3rd<br/>time since I've been on M*U*S*H). It's a sort of 'housekeeping' thing... <br/>maybe 'spring cleaning' is more accurate. Every now and again, you have to do<br/>an assessment of your resources: Are all of your staff productively<br/>contributing to the game?"<br/><br/>kalouri says, "I'm a newspaper writer. In this business, we often see the best<br/>writers promoted into editorial positions. Well, the truth of the matter is<br/>that writing stories and managing writers require two *entirely* different<br/>sets of skills. Often, something similar happens on MUSHes. Good roleplayers<br/>and skilled coders are given the opportunity to become admin/director and it's<br/>just not always a good mix. Don't get me wrong, it often works out well, but<br/>sometimes they simply lack the people skills. It's never easy to reprimand or<br/>fire, but we have to keep the players in mind. They are like customers."<br/>kalouri says, "Exactly, Trispis"<br/><br/>Brody nods. "We just went through something like that. Not with our RP<br/>coordinator, of course, but other staffers not pulling their weight."<br/>Brody says, "We reassigned them."<br/><br/>Grinna says, "I've seen that done kalouri...good roleplayers often don't make<br/>good admin/directors"<br/><br/>Brody grins. "Kal's an exception to the rule."<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; kalouri rolls her eyes at Brody<br/><br/>Octavian plays devil's advocate briefly. ;) "I agree, this happens (and I'm a<br/>journalist, too, and I think kalouri will notice this trend as well), but<br/>occasionally it happens with the unusually talented. For example, I have one<br/>Wizard who refuses to go in-character. He'll write plot ideas but will never<br/>participate in them. But he's so good at writing the ideas that I never<br/>complain about it. If he wants to show up once a month and drop off his ideas,<br/>that works for me because I couldn't replace him if I wanted to. :)"<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Brody says, "Just following Trispis' rule."<br/>&lt;101&gt; Brody says, "Can't pay ya, gotta flatter ya."<br/><br/>Octavian notes that you'll notice he didn't say who it was. This way none of<br/>*you* will get him. ;)<br/><br/>Grinna says, "Well... being admin (a good admin) means giving up a bit of your<br/>ability (freedom) to roleplay."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "too often, admin positions are given as rewards to good<br/>players.  It's a subtle differentiation, but good admins are usually *more*<br/>than just good players... they're the ones who are already doing the work<br/>*before* you hire them."<br/><br/>Brody says, "Yeah, we try to avoid shacking players like that, because, in the<br/>end - it really isn't a reward."<br/>Brody says, "Shackling, even"<br/><br/>Grinna says, "Being an admin is NOT a reward..its a responsibility"<br/><br/>Brody says, "Our best admins are the ones who were newbie helpers and<br/>theme-gurus before we even dreamed of putting them in charge of anything"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "amen."<br/><br/>Brody looks to Octavian. "And if you've got a guy who's productive even if he<br/>can't be on 24/7, hey, roll with it. There's nothing wrong with that."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Okay, folks. I'm tired. You're welcome to continue this as long<br/>as you like, but I need to wrap up my stay here and head for bed."<br/>Trispis says, "Oh... that reminds me... one last thing..."<br/><br/>Brody nods. "Thanks for having us here."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Halatir."<br/>Trispis says, "That kid is amazing."<br/><br/>Brody grins<br/><br/>Grinna grins!<br/><br/>kalouri says, "How unusually well-balanced, Trispis. I'm not sure I can deal<br/>with that :)"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "He completely coded this entire schoolhouse *OFFLINE*."<br/><br/>Grinna says, "Yes he is... we all owe him for reinventing scrabble."<br/><br/>Brody chuckles<br/><br/>Grinna giggles. "He did that too."<br/><br/>Brody says, "Send him my way if he wants to reinvent the slot machine."<br/>Brody grins<br/><br/>Trispis says, "His contributions to 101 cannot be measured in 'online<br/>participation'."<br/>Trispis says, "or to M*U*S*H."<br/>Trispis says, "This schoolhouse is a fully integrated set of all 3 types of<br/>ZONES. PLUS, Javlin's exit dependent room parent. I couldn't begin to<br/>comprehend all of the stuff that went into piecing this place together (wander<br/>the halls, you'll see my artwork, but it's being presented to you through<br/>Halatir's handywork). He did it by setting up his own offline PennMUSH on a<br/>linux box. Everything was tested before put into place. You can't trade that<br/>kind of contribution for anything in the world."<br/><br/>Brody wows. "No, indeed."<br/><br/>Grinna grins. "We should make him a plaque."<br/>Grinna says, "Seriously"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Nah. Jav already gave him a wizbit."<br/><br/>Brody grins<br/><br/>Trispis smirks.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Raevnos... You had a question?"<br/><br/>Raevnos says, "What do you do when, despite all the work of putting together<br/>plots or situations for people to RP in and use, they don't, despite much<br/>prodding to do so?"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "ah... a motivational question... excellent concept to wrap this<br/>all together."<br/>Trispis defers to B &amp; K.<br/><br/>kalouri says, "Is this a problem of people doing their own RP thing or sitting<br/>around in the OOC room chatting, Raevnos?"<br/><br/>Raevnos says, "Getting them to RP, at all."<br/><br/>Brody hrms<br/><br/>Trispis says, "motivating players to participation."<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; kalouri says, "Whip and a chair?"<br/><br/>Trispis offers a comment...<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Dyason says, "Fear"<br/>&lt;101&gt; Dyason says, "First she swings newbies about and now a whip and a chair"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "The one thing I've discovered about *my* activities is: I have<br/>to participate. -- I can't coordinate something, then expect others to carry<br/>it to completion. They lose interest. I think this has something to do with<br/>being a central figure. Newbies wanna hang out in my crate (for you outsiders,<br/>that's my office). In fact, newbies aren't the only ones. (This isn't a<br/>complaint. I've never complained about people who hang out... the ones who<br/>come and go excessively, yes, but the hanging out is fine and welcomed)."<br/>Trispis says, "The point being, players seem to expect their leaders<br/>(admins/coordinators) to be 'in the thick of it' somehow. They want their<br/>leaders to lead."<br/><br/>Brody says, "That's actually a good question. For the story arcs, so far, we<br/>haven't really had that problem. People *come* for that. The fact is, I worry<br/>more about people not RPing when we are between arcs. That's when I want to<br/>get out the cattle prod. I don't think *you* as a MUSH leader can do<br/>*everything*. You can't *make* them RP. If they aren't willing, then I don't<br/>know why they're wasting their time or yours hanging around. But it helps to<br/>draw folks as PCs who will encourage other PCs to play. We have quite a few of<br/>those (in addition to some who just linger and wait for someone to hit them<br/>over the head with a big ol' arc, and complain about having nothing to do).<br/>And Trispis hit it right on the head. Kal and I are both visible. I may be the<br/>creator of the game and the theme, but I can't be an absentee landlord. I make<br/>them *regret* it if they miss an event. Here's one thing we've started<br/>doing..."<br/>Brody says, "We've got a skills system we just integrated. You can get<br/>experience for participating in RP events, and therefore add skills down the<br/>road. A little carrot and stick, but a bonus for folks who play anyway."<br/><br/>kalouri says, "Do all of you remember how absolutely brutal high school dances<br/>were? The gym is dark. The toilet paper streamers are up. But NOBODY would<br/>dance? When OS first started, I sometimes felt like I was back there. What it<br/>took for us was to create a pool of NPCs and just start playing. Eventually,<br/>the PCs started coming around to find out what the h was going on. As time has<br/>passed, we do that less and less. *shrug* Sometimes, I actually miss it :)"<br/><br/>Brody grins<br/>Brody says, "Yeah."<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; enahS notes if a TP hasn't been going very well, it might be worth<br/>taking a poll on why/revising the rest of it<br/>&lt;101&gt; Brody nods. "But the problem is getting them involved to begin with, to<br/>get an opinion, sounds like"<br/><br/>kalouri says, "My point being that somebody has to dance first :)"<br/><br/>Trispis likes k's analogy. (:<br/>Trispis remembers those days well. (;<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Dyason says, "I'm always scared off of trying by the fact that I have no<br/>idea what to do and people assume you know."<br/><br/>kalouri shudders<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Brody says, "Get to know the theme. Talk to players OOCly. Get familiar<br/>:)"<br/>&lt;101&gt; Brody says, "A lot of times, it's easier than it looks."<br/>&lt;101&gt; Trispis has mixed feelings about Shane's comment.<br/>&lt;101&gt; Trispis says, "It depends on your leadership style."<br/>&lt;101&gt; Professor Raevnos says, "Yeah, it's getting people involved in the first<br/>place that's the problem. We admins will start something, but nobody will<br/>continue it unless one of us kicks them and leads it, for each RP session."<br/>&lt;101&gt; Brody says, "That's a definite problem, and I can see the frustration<br/>coming from it"<br/>&lt;101&gt; Brody says, "Can you be more specific, an example?"<br/>&lt;101&gt; Professor Raevnos says, "And sometimes, people then have the gall to<br/>complain about lack of RP."<br/>&lt;101&gt; kalouri says, "Ouch"<br/>&lt;101&gt; Professor Raevnos says, "An example? Hmm. A city holds a fair, inviting<br/>people from other cities and lands all around.	People come (Or are dragged by<br/>the admins, rather). RP happens when an admin herds people together into the<br/>same room, and start something. When the admins aren't doing that, people just<br/>sit around the city and idle. They make no effort to continue things started<br/>in earlier RP sessions, or start new ones, even though possibilities abound."<br/>&lt;101&gt; Brody nods. "What's happening at the fair?"<br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna giggles.<br/>&lt;101&gt; Professor Raevnos says, "Trading, a tournament, various political<br/>meetings and agreements..."<br/>&lt;101&gt; Brody says, "Are these generally veteran players?"<br/>&lt;101&gt; Brody says, "All familiar and comfortable with the theme?"<br/>&lt;101&gt; Professor Raevnos says, "A mix of old and new players."<br/><br/>Trispis pages (Grinna Octavian): Someone email me a log when it finally dies.<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Brody says, "They need to be the ones to help you get the newbies in the<br/>habit of RPing, even if it's just people sitting in a tavern"<br/>
