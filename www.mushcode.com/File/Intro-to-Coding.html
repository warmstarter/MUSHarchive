        From shalott@liii.com<br/>Date: Fri, 1 Dec 1995 21:49:04 -0500<br/>From: Naomi Novik &lt;shalott@liii.com&gt;<br/>To: tf2005@liii.com<br/>Subject: Coding Log<br/><br/>Seminar: Intro to coding<br/><br/>Cyclonus drops Lesson Plan.<br/>Cyclonus says, "OK, all, seminar called to order :)"<br/>Cyclonus points to Lesson Plan. Take a look, this is the outline of the<br/>lesson. Some of the topics will be basic, but I'm going to try and explain<br/>them very thoroughly.<br/>Lesson plan for the seminar:<br/>1) Coding a simple macro<br/>2) All about objects: creating one and giving it attributes. 3) Flags<br/>4) Making a puppet and controlling it<br/>5) Common pitfalls<br/>6) Next seminar :)<br/>Cyclonus says, "OK. The first topic is coding a simple macro, or personal<br/>command. These are really useful shortcuts for combinations of commands<br/>that you use very frequently."<br/>Cyclonus says, "Now, I'm going to type in a sample macro, and then take you<br/>all through it step by step to explain each part."<br/>Cyclonus &amp;say_hello me=$sh:say {Hello there!}<br/>Cyclonus says, "You can all try typing this on yourselves. :) Here's how it<br/>works..."<br/>Cyclonus says, "The &amp;say_hello tells the MUSH that you are doing something<br/>with an ATTRIBUTE named say_hello. An attribute is a part of the code on an<br/>object that makes it unique, just like your physical attributes make you<br/>unique."<br/>Galvatron wonders how to activate the macro<br/>Cyclonus says, "&amp;say_hello me tells the MUSH that you are doing something<br/>with an attribute called "say_hello" that is located on the object named<br/>"me" (IE, on yourself)... I'll get to that in a moment, Galvy. :)"<br/>Cyclonus says, "&amp;say_hello me=&lt;anything&gt; tells the mush to SET the<br/>attribute say_hello on you to &lt;anything&gt;. (btw, any words I type in all<br/>caps are going to be important ones, so if you get confused aboyt their<br/>meaning, don't be afraid to ask me."<br/>Cyclonus says, "Does everyone understand the process of setting the<br/>attribute on yourself? If you don't, say no; if you do, say yes. :)"<br/>Cyclonus repeats the sample macro for the newcomers.<br/>Cyclonus &amp;say_hello me=$sh:say {Hello there!}<br/>Slag says, "No."<br/>Cyclonus says, "OK, Slag has a question..."<br/>Cyclonus says, "Go ahead Slag. I'll answer yours afterwards if it isn't<br/>cleared up by answering Slag's, Thunder &amp; Ramjet."<br/>Slag says, "Okay. So, by typing $say_hello, your are giving yourself an<br/>attribute named, "say hello"?"<br/>Cyclonus says, "Well, for one, it's &amp;say_hello. It's important to use the<br/>ampersand: the dollar sign means something else entirely to the MUSH."<br/>Slag sorries..that's what I meant.<br/>Airwolf says, "The "me" is important too. You could be setting this<br/>attribute on something other than yourself, like an object."<br/>Cyclonus says, "For the second, just typing &amp;say_hello me=<br/>will NOT set an attribute on you, because there's nothing to set on you<br/>there. :) You have to use &amp;say_hello me=&lt;something&gt;"<br/>Thunderbolt uhhhhhs.<br/>Cyclonus says, "Important exception: If there already IS an attribute<br/>called SAY_HELLO on you, typing<br/>&amp;say_hello me=<br/>will SET it to _empty_."<br/>Cyclonus says, "In other words, erase it."<br/>Thunderbolt says, "Is it my turn to question, the Prof.?"<br/>Slag ahhhhh's. Okay.<br/>Cyclonus says, "However... typing<br/>&amp;say_hello me=blah<br/>will create an attribute on you named say_hello that contains the word<br/>"blah". Try that, if you like. :)"<br/>Cyclonus says, "OK, Slag, does that answer your question?"<br/>Thunderbolt says, "I'm confused on this attribute part."<br/>Slag nods<br/>Cyclonus nods, OK, Thunderbolt, what's your question? :)<br/>Thunderbolt says, "Say, your object, say the NoNod, is the '&amp;say_hello<br/>&lt;object&gt;=whatever, would the code say whatever?"<br/>Thunderbolt sorries on the lag, his bad typing and his overall bad day.<br/>Cyclonus says, "I'm not sure I understand your question. Does this answer<br/>it? Typing<br/>&amp;say_hello NoNod=whatever<br/>would create an attribute called say_hello on the NoNod object that<br/>contained the word whatever."<br/>Thunderbolt says, "Well, I bet this is next, but what attributes are for what?"<br/>Cyclonus says, "Important point: an attribute can be named nearly anything<br/>and contain nearly anything. You could do &amp;afgkjhgaiuh<br/>me=aghaiht25826fanilgh7825tohag<br/><br/>An attribute by itself doesn't _do_ anything. It's what is contained in an<br/>attribute (ie, what's after the equal sign ) that actually has an effect."<br/>Thunderbolt says, "So what would your example do?"<br/>Cyclonus nods to Thunderbolt, that's next. :) I want to make sure<br/>everyone's clear on this before I continue.<br/>Cyclonus says, "Does everyone get the principle of setting an attribute? :)"<br/>Thunderbolt shurgs, but "Go ahead.<br/>Slag nods<br/>Arcee does. :)<br/>Cyclonus repeats the sample macro again: &amp;say_hello me=$sh:say {Hello there!}<br/>Cyclonus says, "OK. Now let's move on to the content of this macro. The<br/>first thing inside this macro is a $. The $, when it's the first letter of<br/>an attribute, has a very important function: It tells the mush that this<br/>attribute contains a command."<br/>Cyclonus says, "The commands created this way are called $-TRIGGERS,<br/>because they start with a $ and TRIGGER some sort of event."<br/>Cyclonus says, "I've now put the sample macron on the lesson plan so you<br/>can all look at it while I babble, btw. :)"<br/>Cyclonus says, "You can use nearly any word or phrase you want to use as<br/>the actual trigger word. The trigger word is what you will type to activate<br/>the command, so it usually makes sense to make it as short and<br/>easy-to-remember as you can."<br/>Cyclonus says, "The trigger word follows the $ and is ended with a colon<br/>(:). Because of that, you can't use colons inside trigger words (I made<br/>that mistake once and spent hours trying to figure out what was wrong ;)"<br/>Cyclonus says, "Slag, you have a question?"<br/>Slag nods, "Can you set macos to already existing attributes?"<br/>Cyclonus says, "Are you asking if you can erase an attribute that already<br/>exists and replace it with one that has a macro?"<br/>Saber has arrived.<br/>Slag says, "Sort of...maybe i'm just impatient, but how would you set the<br/>TRIGGER to execute an attack or something? Woulnd't that go off of an<br/>already existing attribute?"<br/>Cyclonus says, "You're getting ahead of the program in that case. :) I'll<br/>get to that in time."<br/>Saber says, "Hello there!"<br/>Galvatron says, "Surrender or be obliterated!! HUAHAHAH!!"<br/>Saber laughs<br/>Galvatron says, "what the??"<br/>Cyclonus says, "Saber, please don't spam or test the macro just yet. :)"<br/>Slag sorries..then eats Galvatron<br/>Cyclonus says, "Please, no spam."<br/>Galvatron says, "uhhh, how did that go off?"<br/>Saber says, "OK."<br/>Galvatron didn't do it<br/>Cyclonus will explain that too, Galvy :)<br/>Saber didn't.<br/>Galvatron looks suspiciously at cyc, then goes quiet<br/>Cyclonus says, "OK, does everyone understand how you choose and create the<br/>trigger word?"<br/>Cyclonus says, "OK. Now, everything that follows the colon is a COMMAND<br/>LIST. A command list is a list of commands that are already defined. In<br/>this case, the command list is just:<br/>say {Hello there!}"<br/>Mirage puts his hand up.<br/>Adamia has arrived.<br/>Cyclonus says, "All of you are familiar with the say command (or the "<br/>command, which does the same thing). This is a command that is already<br/>defined inside the MUSH, and it has an effect: it makes the object that<br/>enters that command say whatever is after it."<br/>Cyclonus says, "Mirage, you have a question?"<br/>Adamia wavers hi then immediately quiets.<br/>Mirage says, "Yeah. Where exactly do we put the colon? After the $ sign?"<br/>Mirage never minds as he looks at the lesson plan.<br/>Cyclonus LAGS!<br/>Cyclonus says, "The colon follows the end of the $-TRIGGER"<br/>Mirage nods<br/>Cyclonus nods.<br/>Cyclonus says, "OK...now, whenever someone types the $-TRIGGER of a macro,<br/>the COMMAND LIST of that macro gets executed."<br/>Cyclonus says, "And that's how it works, on the most basic level. Does<br/>everyone understand so far?"<br/>Cyclonus says, "OK. Now, to make this sample macro a little more<br/>complicated." Cyclonus says, "Actually, before I do that, let me also warn<br/>you about a couple of pitfalls involved in any macro."<br/>Cyclonus demonstrates one.<br/>Saber says, "Hello there!"<br/>Mirage grin<br/>Cyclonus says, "I just typed "sh". :)"<br/>Saber says, "Hello there!"<br/>Saber says, "Hello there!"<br/>Saber says, "Hello there!"<br/>Galvatron LOL<br/>Cyclonus says, "And triggered SABER's macro... please stop now all :)"<br/>Saber says, "You can stop now."<br/>Thunderbolt says, "BRB"<br/>Cyclonus says, "Back in the bad old days, you had to do nasty annoying<br/>things to get around this little problem. Now, however, there is one simple<br/>thing that you can do to avoid this problem all the time."<br/>Thunderbolt has disconnected.<br/>Cyclonus says, "You need to USELOCK yourself. Just like @lock me=me, which<br/>locks you so no one can pick you up, @lock/use me=me will lock you so no<br/>one else can USE you or your macros."<br/>Saber knew he forgot to do something when this character was created.<br/>Cyclonus says, "OK, that's problem one... the second common problem is a<br/>FLAG called NO_COMMAND. This flag is a default flag: it's automatically set<br/>on every object and character that is created on the MUSH."<br/>Cyclonus says, "Anything that has this flag on it, the MUSH takes one look<br/>at, says "Oh, this has NO COMMANDS on it, so I can ignore it" and none of<br/>the commands on the object will work."<br/>Cyclonus says, "To check and see if you have this flag set on you, type<br/>"brief me" and look at the line right under your name, after the word<br/>"Flags:"" Cyclonus says, "If you do, just type<br/>@set me=!NO_COMMAND<br/>to reset the flag."<br/>Cyclonus says, "Then any commands you put on yourself will work. Does<br/>everyone understand so far?"<br/>Cyclonus says, "OK, great :) Now, everyone take another look at the macro<br/>on the lesson plan, as we're now going to make it a little more<br/>complicated." Cyclonus says, "As I mentioned above, everything after the<br/>colon is the COMMAND LIST. You can have a whole slew of commands in the<br/>command list. The way you separate the commands is with semicolons (;)."<br/>Cyclonus says, "Now, you'll notice that in the current macro, there's an<br/>odd difference between the first command and hte second command. In the<br/>first command, the message is enclosed in {}. In the second, the message<br/>isn't."<br/>Quiet Coding Room<br/>Please follow the rules of the room: 1) No spamming 2) No leaving spammy<br/>objects in here. They will be immediately @nuked, no questions asked. Type<br/>'spamdef' for a definition (NOT an example, don't worry) of spammy.3) Ask<br/>others in the room before testing any spammy objects.

Using<br/>{} is just a VERY good habit to get into, because very often they ARE<br/>necessary, and if you aren't used to using them, you can spend a long time<br/>trying to figure out what is wrong with a command."<br/>Cyclonus now fixes the macro on the lesson plan to be right :)<br/>Whiz has reconnected.<br/>Adamia okays so i'd do the ; pose waves then? Cyclonus says, "Slag, your<br/>question?"<br/>Whiz has partially disconnected.<br/>Slag says, "So, exactly what do I have to put around then?"<br/>Slag says, "er.."""<br/>Cyclonus hehs. Type a \ before the first { to make it show up :) Slag<br/>aaaaah's...{}<br/>Slag says, "those"<br/>Saber says, "/"<br/>Cyclonus says, "Like I said, it's complicated. You're safe if you put {}<br/>around everything, basically."<br/>Saber says, "{}"<br/>Slag says, "Around just stuff you want to say, or everything, including<br/>commands..?"<br/>Cyclonus says, "You can put it around everything, although messages are one<br/>of the most common things that have problems unless you put }"<br/>Cyclonus says, "oops. {} around them."<br/><br/>**This is actually wrong *:) If you put {} around the commands in this<br/>**example, it won't work! *ouch*. Sorry. :&gt;  -Cyc<br/><br/>Slag okays<br/>Hoist has arrived.<br/>Hoist comes into the room, looking for those who haven't been checked up on<br/>lately.<br/>Cyclonus says, "OK, is everyone clear on this?"<br/><br/>Cyclonus says, "OK! Now, let's take the next step. :)"<br/>Cyclonus says, "The next step is making this macro personal. After all, if<br/>you say the same thing and wave every time someone comes in, it's sort of<br/>like one of those annoying form letters. :) To make it personal, we need to<br/>add a VARIABLE."<br/>Cyclonus says, "A VARIABLE is just something that changes every time the<br/>command is executed. The MUSH has a few different ways of allowing you to<br/>put in variables, but we're going to concentrate on the most basic and also<br/>most useful kind."<br/>Cyclonus says, "Here is our rewritten macro: &amp;say_hello me=$sh *:say {Hello<br/>there, %0!};pose {waves.} "<br/>Cyclonus says, "Two parts go into making a variable. First part: You have<br/>to add a WILDCARD to the $-TRIGGER. A wildcard is just like a wildcard in<br/>any card game: it can be anything. A wildcard is represented in a $-TRIGGER<br/>by the asterisk (*) symbol."<br/>Cyclonus says, "What that means is that this command can now be triggered<br/>by typing<br/>sh &lt;ANYTHING&gt;<br/>For example: sh snorfblat globble<br/>would trigger the command ;)"<br/>Cyclonus says, "Second part: we have to make whatever was in the wildcard<br/>show up in the command. Here's where it gets a little complicated."<br/>Cyclonus says, "The MUSH has several storage spaces called REGISTERS. These<br/>REGISTERS store information for the length of a command. There are a total<br/>of ten registers, which can hold just about anything. They are numbered<br/>0-9. Whenever you have a wildcard in a command, the stuff that replaces the<br/>wildcard in what you actually type gets stuffed into one of the registers.<br/>(don't ask questions about this part yet, wait til I finish explaining)."<br/>Cyclonus says, "The stuff that replaces the first wildcard gets put into<br/>the 0 register. The stuff that replaces the second wildcard gets put into<br/>the 1 register, and so on up until 9. You can't have more wildcards than 10<br/>in a command for that reason :)."<br/>Cyclonus continues... "In our nice macro, there is only one wildcard, so<br/>everything that replaces it in the actually typed command will get put into<br/>the 0 register. So, when you type<br/>sh snorfblat globble<br/>the 0 register will contain: snorfblat globble"<br/>Cyclonus says, "OK. Slag, you had a question? I'll take them on this part,<br/>but don't ask why I'm explaining it, it'll become clear in a moment :)"<br/>Slag okays, "I was wondering, do you need more than one wildcard if you<br/>have more than one variable?<br/>Mirage actually thiks this is making some stuff clearer than it was before<br/>:) Cyclonus says, "Yes, Slag, you do. :)"<br/>Slag says, "So how do you type that?"<br/>Cyclonus says, "Note: you don't need more than one wildcard for one WORD.<br/>But you do need more than one wildcard if you want to have more than one<br/>variable... well, that again gets more complicated, so let me finish<br/>explaining this part first. :)"<br/>Slag okays<br/>Cyclonus says, "Does everyone understand this so far? :)"<br/>Cyclonus says, "OK. The next step is, we want to get the information OUT of<br/>the register and INTO the command."<br/>Cyclonus says, "And to do that, we use the handy-dandy % symbol."<br/>Cyclonus says, "Example: when you include %0 in a command, it is replaced<br/>by whatever is in the 0 register."<br/>Cyclonus says, "So, when you type<br/>sh snorfblat globble<br/>The result will be:<br/>Cyclonus says, "Hello there, snorfblat globble!"<br/>Cyclonus waves."<br/>Adamia ahhhhs.<br/>Cyclonus says, "Everyone understand so far? :)"<br/>Slag wonders what's in the other registers<br/>Airwolf says, "Yes."<br/>Whiz cools<br/>Cyclonus says, "Slag, to answer your question:"<br/>Whiz puts her hand up. She has a question when you're done with Slag but<br/>may be jumping the gun.<br/>Cyclonus says, "In this particular case, the other registers are EMPTY.<br/>There's nothing in them, because there was only one wildcard in the<br/>command. If you made a mistake and had this command on you: &amp;say_hello<br/>me=$sh *:{say Hello there, %1!} When you typed<br/>sh snorfblat<br/>The result would be<br/>Cyclonus says, "Hello there, !"<br/>Cyclonus waves.<br/>which would look sort of silly. :)"<br/>Slag OOOOOH's as the really big, Mack truck of ideas hits him<br/>Cyclonus says, "OK, now, Adamia, you had a question?"<br/>Saber wonders why no one's tried it yet.<br/>Whiz dunnos about Adamia, but she has one.<br/>Adamia wonders if the register 0 would change each time if you wanted to<br/>use the macro on 3 seperate persons<br/>Cyclonus says, "To avoid spam, Saber. :) We can test afterwards, when the<br/>log is done."<br/>Cyclonus nods, exactly.<br/>Saber says, "OK."<br/>Adamia okays then<br/>Slag says, "then you could have 9 variables in one macro?"<br/>Cyclonus says, "If you typed 'sh Adamia', it would put in Adamia for the<br/>%0. If you typed sh Slag after that, it would put Slag in for the %0. :)<br/>The registers are cleared out after every command is finished, so there<br/>won't be anything left in them."<br/>Cyclonus says, "Whiz was next..."<br/>Slag oh's<br/>Cyclonus says, "Briefly, Slag, yes, you can have up to 10 variables in one<br/>macro."<br/>Whiz says, "What if two people run a macro at once? And along those lines,<br/>why does one person's macro trigger another person's if they both have the<br/>same name?"<br/>Whiz says, "For example, I have kicked people on accident when my kick<br/>macro was triggered."<br/>Air Raid has arrived.<br/>Saber raises his hand.<br/>Cyclonus says, "OK, let me answer the second question first. It doesn't<br/>matter if the macros have the same attribute name: it only matters if their<br/>macros have the same $-TRIGGER. And in this case, Whiz, you weren't<br/>uselocked, which we discussed earler."<br/>Whiz says, "Oh, ok."<br/>Saber puts his hand down.<br/>Cyclonus says, "As for why, that's how the MUSH works. :) When you type in<br/>something, the MUSH starts looking around for a command to match it with.<br/>It looks at all the commands that are part of the MUSH code, then it looks<br/>around on you and your objects, then it looks at the objects in the same<br/>room as you, then it looks at the global objects. This can become very<br/>technical, so I wont' go into it further."<br/>Whiz doesn't need to get technical, that's quite ok with me :)<br/>Cyclonus says, "Now, to answer your second question, that doesn't cause a<br/>problem. THe MUSH is smart enough to keep track of the registers for the<br/>separate people."<br/>Cyclonus says, "Adamia, the syntax is: @lock/use me=me"<br/>Cyclonus says, "Airwolf, you're next. :)"<br/>Adamia d'ohs.<br/>Airwolf nods. "Back to multiple variables. Let's say I wanted to say hello<br/>to the people in the room. How would I code the macro so I didn't have to<br/>repeat it x times?<br/>Airwolf says, "Wait, that's not a good example."<br/>Cyclonus says, "OK. Well, in this example, you don't really need multiple<br/>variables. You could just type:<br/>sh Slag, Adamia, Airwolf<br/>and it would say, "Hello there, Slag, Adamia, Airwolf!" and wave."<br/>Airwolf says, "Just two variables, with different uses in the $trigger."<br/>Cyclonus says, "I want to make sure I have answered all the questions on<br/>this before we get into multiple variables, actually... just one second.<br/>:)" Cyclonus says, "Saber, do you still ahve a question?"<br/>Airwolf nods.<br/>Saber says, "No."<br/>Cyclonus says, "Slag, then :)"<br/>Slag says, "Okay, how would you type multiple wildcars, just "****" or<br/>something? Slag confused."<br/>Cyclonus says, "OK, before I go into this, is everyone ok with the current<br/>macro? Do you all understand how it works?"<br/>Cyclonus says, "OK. Then onward to multiple variables. :)"<br/>Adamia thinks so.<br/>Slag cheers<br/>Saber nods.<br/>Cyclonus says, "OK. Let's say that you now want to give the newcomer an<br/>idea of how you're feeling. You might want to pose "waves happily" or<br/>"waves glumly"."<br/>Cyclonus says, "Since you don't always feel the same way, you want this to<br/>be another variable. Take a look at the lesson plan now to see how I've set<br/>this up."<br/>Cyclonus says, "You'll notice that there's now a second wildcard in the<br/>message, separated from the first one by an equals sign (=)."<br/>Cyclonus says, "The $-TRIGGER is now sh *=*, which will be matched by<br/>typing sh &lt;anything&gt;=&lt;anything&gt;"<br/>Arcee says, "Kinda like a Mad Lib :)"<br/>Cyclonus says, "Does it have to be an equals sign? No. Not at all. You<br/>could have the $-COMMAND be sh * * or sh *-* or sh */* if you liked."<br/>Cyclonus nods to Arcee. "The reason I like to use = in the $-Trigger is<br/>because it's not normally used in a phrase. For instance, you don't want to<br/>use sh * * because the first wildcard will STOP as soon as it hits the<br/>first space.<br/>Cyclonus says, "So if you tried to type<br/>sh Arcee and Slag happily<br/>while having sh * * as the $-TRIGGER, it would result in: Cyclonus says,<br/>"Hello there, Arcee!"<br/>Cyclonus waves and Slag happily."<br/>Cyclonus says, "Which looks silly :)"<br/>Whiz snickers<br/>Adamia raises hand<br/>Slag aha's<br/>Cyclonus says, "Adamia?"<br/>Adamia says, "hmmm... just wondered something..."<br/>Adamia says, "do you do a *=*=* and so on for each of the variables/registers?"<br/>Cyclonus says, "Yep, exactly :)"<br/>Cyclonus says, "Anyway, this has run overtime, so I don't think we're going<br/>to get to the rest of the lesson plan *:&gt;"<br/>Slag darns<br/>Cyclonus says, "Does everyone understand this much? :)"<br/>Whiz figured :)<br/>Airwolf says, "Yes."<br/>Cyclonus has to go eat dinner :)<br/>Slag nods and hugs Cyclonus<br/>Doc nods<br/>Whiz says, "Thanks so much, Cyc!"<br/>Airwolf waves.<br/>Cyclonus says, "Next seminar announcement: )"<br/>Cyclonus says, "The next one will be on more complex commands, using<br/>@select/@switch and @dolist, with an introduction to functions."<br/><br/>                    ...out flew the web and floated wide<br/>                      the mirror crack'd from side to side...<br/>                             -the lady of shalott-<br/><br/>                            email: shalott@deshaw.com<br/>                           http://www.liii.com/~tf2005<br/><br/>
