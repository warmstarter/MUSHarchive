          TINYTIM HELP TOPIC:<br/>  CONCEPT: XANADU, OR WHY PEOPLE GENERALLY DON'T VISIT YOUR LAUNDRY ROOM<br/> <br/>  "In Xanadu did Khubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree.."<br/> <br/>  The poem "Xanadu" is incomplete, because the author, in a opium-filled<br/>  haze, was interrupted by an insurance salesman at his door. This<br/>  salesman kept talking long enough to completely fratz that precious<br/>  state of mind required to maintain an epic poem. As a result, the<br/>  poem "Xanadu" stands at a mere couple of stanzas and is forever<br/>  incomplete.<br/> <br/>  In TIM, the open building system allows you to create some real<br/>  humdinger places, IN THEORY. Ideally, you can have a stately manor that<br/>  will stretch from here to the hills, filled with TIMsters oohing and<br/>  aahing at the splendor of your creations. In theory, anyway.<br/> <br/>  The general reality is that TinyTIM has a lot of homes and places<br/>  built that start out strong, trail off quickly, and eventually fall<br/>  apart into a pile of text dung.<br/> <br/>  Now, this may sound like a harsh and cruel condensation of the place,<br/>  but unfortunately it's very true. More often than not, it's because<br/>  the Player/Builders didn't spend a few minutes to work out their own<br/>  motivations for building a place. There are some questions you want<br/>  to ask yourself, and here they are in a handy checklist form.<br/> <br/>  ___ AM I BUILDING THIS JUST FOR ME, OR FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO SEE?<br/> <br/>      TinyTIM is, after all, a MULTI-USER Shared Hallucination, which<br/>      means that other people will be visiting your place. If you<br/>      fill rooms with shorthand descriptions that invoke NO image in<br/>      your guests' minds, then you're wasting their time and if you<br/>      have something you wanted them to think or feel, you might not<br/>      succeed if people turn away after the first couple of Rooms.<br/>      Build a place you want to share, not a place you want to hoard.<br/> <br/>  ___ IS EVERY ROOM IN MY PLACE A PART OF THE WHOLE, OR IS IT USELESS?<br/> <br/>      If you're building a house, you want each and every Room to be<br/>      an IMPORTANT contribution to the feel of the place, and not just<br/>      a creme filling in the twinkie of your Mansion. Do you NEED a<br/>      Laundry Room, if all it is is a description and some more exits?<br/>      You want what Rooms you DO choose to put in your home to be<br/>      either wonderful places in themselves, or vital links in the<br/>      chain.<br/> <br/>  ___ DOES ALL MY STUFF HAVE A DESCRIPTION, A USE, AND A PART TO PLAY?<br/> <br/>      By this, it means that you should be adding Objects in your<br/>      Rooms ONLY when the Description of the Room doesn't say enough.<br/>      If the Description says there is a Waterfall that goes down<br/>      to a stream with rocks in it, THERE'S NO NEED TO MAKE THE ROCKS<br/>      unless you're going to make them really special and purposeful<br/>      for people visiting. (Maybe they could sit on them, or touch<br/>      them, or the like). This holds especially true indoors, where<br/>      there's no need to build Furniture Objects if the furniture is<br/>      mentioned in the Description. Making an Object indicates that<br/>      that Object is to be Interacted with, and that means having a<br/>      Description (HELP @DESC), Senses if you can, (HELP SENSES),<br/>      shouldn't be able to be picked up unless you intended them to<br/>      (HELP @LOCK), and maybe even could have a special command or<br/>      use that you programmed in. (HELP @USE, HELP $ COMMANDS).<br/>      Just remember.... If you make an object that doesn't DO<br/>      anything near another Object that you spent a lot of time<br/>      programming, people might never check out your work on the<br/>      second object. Players learn fast, and if you show a certain<br/>      style of carelessness, they adapt to it quickly.<br/> <br/>  ___ DO ALL OF MY EXITS FUNCTION CORRECTLY, LIKE OTHERS WILL EXPECT?<br/> <br/>      This means that when you @OPEN Exits between your Rooms, you<br/>      should make sure that others will see you pass through the<br/>      portal (HELP @OSUCC) and that others in the destination Room<br/>      will see you come in (HELP @ODROP). Otherwise, people will just<br/>      see "&lt;Yourname&gt; has arrived." and not have any idea where you<br/>      came from or where you're going off to, breaking up parties of<br/>      TIMsters like nobody's business. It would probably help a lot<br/>      if you set the @DESC of the Exit as well, so people who type<br/>      LOOK NORTH will get some idea of where the path leads.<br/> <br/>  ___ DO I THINK TOPOLOGY IS SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE STUDY OF TOPS?<br/> <br/>      Topology, or the layout of the land, is something that is<br/>      up to you. If people go NORTH into a Room, they kind of expect<br/>      that they could go SOUTH and end up in the Room they came from.<br/>      If this ISN'T the case, you should have a very good reason why,<br/>      like a locked door or a steel slide leading down, or maybe a<br/>      programmed object that pushes the Players along to the next<br/>      Location. You should NOT have the exits just link to each of<br/>      the Rooms willy-nilly unless this is SPECIFICALLY the effect<br/>      you wish to have. Also, you can define multiple names in an<br/>      Exit, like NORTH;N;NO;AHEAD;FORWARD... You should use this<br/>      feature to anticipate what Players might type to go into that<br/>      direction.<br/> <br/>  ___ AM I LEAVING A LOT OF MY PLACE UNDONE AND UNFINISHED?<br/> <br/>      The cardinal sin in building on TIM is to build a lot of empty<br/>      Rooms with the intention of filling them "later". Some Players<br/>      who do this do so because they want to keep the layout fresh<br/>      in their minds. Our advice is to use a piece of paper and draw<br/>      little squares with lines between them. This saves everyone<br/>      time in the long run; players who stumble into your house by<br/>      mistake won't get drawn in and misled by the empty rooms, and<br/>      you'll have a way to work on your TIM project while riding<br/>      around in a bus. The Wizards of TIM can't guarantee that your<br/>      many multiple empty Rooms will be waiting for you the next<br/>      time you log in.<br/> <br/>  ___ HAVE I BUILT A PLACE I'M PROUD TO PUT MY NAME ON?<br/> <br/>      The last thing to keep in mind is: You're Never Really Done. A<br/>      place on TIM, like a garden or living space in real life,<br/>      should be given attention every once in a while, with changes<br/>      in spelling or grammar, or the addition of features as you<br/>      become more proficient in programming, and the like. It should<br/>      be a LIVING PLACE, a place that grows and changes with you.<br/>      Very little on TinyTIM is truly static.<br/> <br/>  With this checklist, you could be on your way to building a place<br/>  that will knock the socks off your visitors, although ideally they'll<br/>  be unable to find a "Laundry Room" to put them in.
