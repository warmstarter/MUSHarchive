        Topic: Building Basics<br/>Author: Grinna<br/>Summary: Grinna reveals the secrets of making ROOMs and EXITs.<br/><br/>Building Classroom(#1064JRn)<br/><br/>The room is well lit, allowing a bright work space. Piles of wood and metal<br/>line the north wall, and the wall to the east is covered by shelves and bins<br/>on either side of the doorway. There are oak work tables and work benches, and<br/>chairs scattered throughout. The table tops have drills and saws, hammers and<br/>nails, screwdrivers and screws hanging in a neatly organized manner off the<br/>edges. Schematics, layouts and blueprints are attached to the walls.<br/><br/>A chalkboard fills the west wall, with an old beat-up lectern in front of it.<br/>The other three walls are painted off-white.<br/>Obvious exits:<br/>Hallway &lt;O&gt;<br/><br/>Grinna says, "Okay.. Lets get started then."<br/>Grinna says, "Welcome to basic building class. Today I hope to cover the<br/>following subjects:<br/> @dig<br/> @open<br/> Link_Ok flag<br/> @link<br/> @desc<br/> Writing a better desc<br/> Doing exit descs<br/> @succ<br/> @osucc<br/> @odrop<br/> @lock<br/> @ofail<br/> @fail"<br/><br/>Grinna says, "Before we actually get into the class I would like everyone to<br/>do @chan/on 101. After a bit of discussion about how things work you will be<br/>able to practice your building skills from the Building Lab or you may choose<br/>to start in Javelin's Building Nexus for a bit. This will make the 101 channel<br/>the easiest way to continue the class. So, Please, no building until after the<br/>lecture portion of the class and be sure to keep some paper and a pen/pencil<br/>nearby because you will need to make a few notes. :)"<br/>Grinna says, "First we will discuss the @dig command. There are several ways<br/>to use this command<br/><br/>One is to type:<br/>  @dig &lt;Room name&gt;.<br/><br/>This creates a floating room that you must teleport to and from.<br/><br/>You may also @dig/teleport &lt;Room name&gt;... which makes a floating room AND<br/>teleports you to it, however it has NO exits.<br/>When you DO @dig a room.. the MUSH will give you a message like this:<br/><br/>&lt;Room name&gt; created with #&lt;room dbref&gt;. <br/><br/>(You should ALWAYS make a note of this dbref # and any other rooms and exits<br/>you create.)"<br/> <br/>@DIG <br/>@dig &lt;room name&gt; [= &lt;exit name&gt;;&lt;exit alias&gt;*,&lt;exit name&gt;;&lt;exit alias&gt;*] <br/>@dig/teleport<br/>   <br/>   This command is used to create a new room, possibly with exits linking<br/>it to the room you are standing in. This command normally costs 10 pennies,<br/>although some MUSHes may have different amounts or may restrict this<br/>command to those with the builder @power.<br/>   <br/>   @dig/teleport will automatically @tel the digger to the new room.<br/>   <br/>   If you use the long form of this command, an exit to the new room from<br/>the one you are standing in and an exit back from the new room will both be<br/>automatically @open'ed and @link'ed. You may have as many or as few exit<br/>aliases for an exit as you like, separated in the command by semicolons.<br/>The exit leading to the new room is separated from the exit leading back by<br/>a single comma.<br/> <br/> (continued in help @dig2)<br/> <br/>Grinna says, "Now, after you've dug a room, it might be nice to have some<br/>exits so that:<br/><br/> 1. You are connected to the MUSH landscape, and<br/> 2. It's easier for you and other people to enter and leave your room."<br/><br/>Grinna says, "In order to create exits and connect them and your room to the<br/>MUSH lets discuss @open and @link a bit. Please read help @open."<br/><br/>@OPEN<br/>  @open &lt;exit name&gt;<br/>  @open &lt;exit name&gt;;&lt;exit alias&gt;*=&lt;destination&gt;<br/>  @open &lt;exit name&gt;;&lt;exit alias&gt;*=&lt;destination&gt;,&lt;exit name&gt;;&lt;exit alias&gt;*<br/>  <br/>  This command opens an exit in the room you are standing in with the <br/>  specified name. You can then use the @link command to set the exit's<br/>  destination, or you can set it automatically by using the DBREF of a<br/>  destination, which can be a room or object. (Note that you CANNOT open<br/>  exits from objects.) If you also include the second exit name, an exit<br/>  from the destination room will be opened back to the room you are in.<br/><br/>  * Note that you can have as many exit aliases as you like by adding more,<br/>  separated by semicolons. An exit alias allows you to type that instead of <br/>  the full exit name to go through the exit. Only the exit name appears in<br/>  the list of Obvious Exits in a room.<br/>  <br/> See also: EXITS, @link, @dig<br/> <br/>Grinna says, "Using the instructions given with 'help @open' you see that the<br/>first thing you need after the @open command is &lt;exit name&gt; then a semicolon<br/>(;) then &lt;exit alias&gt; (the '*' indicating that you may continue adding more<br/>&lt;exit alias'&gt;) then an equal sign (=) and a destination (which as the<br/>instructions say must be a dbref #)."<br/><br/>Grinna says, "A word about exit alias':<br/><br/>Exit alias' should include all the possible name variations that you can think<br/>of including a compass direction, and the given name of the exit.<br/><br/>Note also that the compass direction IN is /opposite/ that of the compass<br/>direction OUT.<br/><br/>Also notice that while you should use OUT as an alias for the way out, IN is<br/>never or /rarely/ used."<br/><br/>Grinna says, "For Example:<br/><br/>Contemporary Worlds &lt;CO&gt;;CO Contemporary worlds;cw;contemp;con;out;o;west;w<br/><br/>This would be the exit leading out of the room you are in /it must be YOUR<br/>room/ for the @open command to work."<br/><br/>Grinna says, "If anyone ever has any questions, just pipe up on the 101<br/>channel. :)"<br/>Grinna says, "The next part of the @open command is '=&lt;destination&gt;' This is<br/>where you put the dbref# of the room you wish your exit to let you OUT of your<br/>room at. This room MUST be either owned by you OR have a Link_ok flag on it.<br/>You can use @open without a dbref# destination but then you have an unlinked<br/>exit..which is /not/ a good thing. However you may then use the @link command<br/>to connect it to a Link_ok room...*WARNING* but so may /anyone/ else."<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Trispis says, "Can you open an exit /without/ linking it?"<br/>&lt;101&gt; Trispis says, "Nevermind."<br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna grins.<br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna says, "Good question tho."<br/><br/>Grinna says, "After the =&lt;destination&gt; you will see <br/><br/>,&lt;exit name&gt;;&lt;exit alias&gt;<br/><br/>Note that you will need a comma (,) and then another exit name. The comma<br/>starts another command - in this case opening another exit, which would be the<br/>exit returning to your room."<br/><br/>Grinna says, "Okay now, class. Lets read help @link. :)"<br/> <br/>@LINK<br/>  @link &lt;object&gt;=&lt;dbref | here | home | variable&gt;<br/>  <br/>  Links &lt;object&gt; to either a room or a thing. If a thing or player is<br/>  linked, that sets the object's HOME. If a room is linked, that sets <br/>  the object's drop-to room, which is where objects that are dropped<br/>  in the room will be sent to.<br/><br/>  Most often, @link is used to link or relink an exit to a destination <br/>  room. In order to link an exit to a room, you must either own or control<br/>  the room, OR the room must be set LINK_OK. If you do not own an exit and<br/>  you relink it, the exit will be set HALT and @chowned to you. Linking an<br/>  exit usually costs 1 penny.<br/> <br/>  If the destination of an exit is "variable", its destination is determined<br/>  at the time of travel by the attribute DESTINATION on the exit, which is<br/>  evaluated like a U()-function. Only Wizards may create variable exits.<br/><br/>  LINK_OK objects can also be used as semaphores, and any object<br/>  can be @parented to them.<br/>  <br/> See also: EXITS, @open, @dig, DROP-TO, HOME<br/> <br/><br/>Grinna says, "You will notice that @link is useful for more than building.<br/>However, we are just going to concentrate on the building aspects of @link<br/>today. :)"<br/>Grinna says, "@link requires an object and a dbref#. The object in for our<br/>purpose is the exit, which would be for example: Contemporary Worlds &lt;CO&gt;;CO<br/>Contemporary worlds;contemp;cw;con;out;o;west;w. The dbref# would be the<br/>number of the target room (the room you want to link your exit to). *CAUTION*<br/>For exits, you must own/control the target room unless its LINK_OK flag is<br/>set. If you do not own/control the target room then you may only link an exit<br/>TO that room, but not make one returning you to that room. You may, however,<br/>link any unlinked exit to your room."<br/>Grinna says, "The /preferred/ method in building is to @dig your room and both<br/>the exits in and out all at the same time. Using this method looks something<br/>like this when typed.<br/><br/>@dig My Sample Room=My Sample Room &lt;MSY&gt;;msr;my sample room;my sample;my<br/>room;ms;mr;east;ea,Contemporary Worlds &lt;CO&gt;;co;contemporary<br/>worlds;contemp;con;cw;out;o;west;w<br/><br/> "<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Trispis wows.

You should /avoid/<br/>using alias's such as ME, E, EX, B, BR, I, L,  or P.  Also avoid using the<br/>same alias' in the same room.  The game will choose randomly which exit it<br/>thinks you mean.

A simple<br/>example of a room description would be:"<br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna says, "@desc here=This is my room.  A light hangs from the<br/>ceiling and a carpet covers the floor.

A television sits across the<br/>room from the couch.<br/>Obvious exits:<br/>Futuristic Worlds<br/> <br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna says, "That desc is pretty basic isn't it? :)  But what you want<br/>when you write a desc for your room is something that conveys the atmosphere<br/>of the room.. You want colors and textures and lighting.. Just like setting a<br/>stage. :)"<br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna says, "So has anyone out there have a suggestions for how to make<br/>this basic desc better?"<br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna says, "I would for example write: This is Grinna's room.  A lamp<br/>hangs from the ceiling covered with a blue flowered, white globe.  A dark<br/>blue, overstuffed couch is aligned along the west wall	A low, long, oak<br/>coffee table sits within easy reach in front of the couch.  Across the light<br/>blue carpetted floor sits a small television set upon a dark oak tv stand."<br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna says, "This desc could also be improved even more by adding<br/>windows, curtains, extra lamps and tables, chairs, bookcases, etc.  You could<br/>describe it as facing the rising sun.  Or it could be without a window at all<br/>and therefore dark except for the single light hanging from the ceiling."<br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna says, "One word of caution tho.  It is quite possible to get<br/>carried away with your descriptions.  It's been my experience that most MUSH<br/>ppl will really only read a desc of 15 lines or less."<br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna says, "Also for those ppl that use telnet, long descs are almost<br/>impossible for them to read."<br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna says, "Any questions?"<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Gyles nopes.<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Mee says, "Nope."<br/> <br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna says, "Okay, Now for those pesky exits you own."<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Trispis says, "I'm using TF and have often used telnet... anything over<br/>8 lines can get pushed off screen if it's very active on the MUSH (channels,<br/>pages, rp, etc.)"<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna says, "I stand corrected. :)"<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Trispis will read 12 (if it's not busy)... anything longer, I won't even<br/>read one line.<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Mee says, "But many mushes have +view, or something similar."<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Trispis nods. +view is a good place to put extra details. (:<br/>&lt;101&gt; Trispis says, "As that's a global, though, we shouldn't discuss it too<br/>much."<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna says, "That's correct.. and +view can be used to add a lot to<br/>your descs.  But T is right, I was not going to cover that at this time. :)"<br/> <br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna says, "Now back to those exits. :) They need descriptions too. It<br/>is very good building policy to give all your exits a description.  Exit<br/>descriptions /can/ at times be even longer than a room description.  Consider<br/>describing an exit that leads into a Castle or a Mansion."<br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna says, "You would want to use the exit description to describe the<br/>entire OUTSIDE of the Castle or Mansion.  Not just the doorway leading into<br/>the Abode."<br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna says, "Your description in this case doesn't need to be quite so<br/>detailed as that.. however you can describe the door or lack of one.. plus the<br/>wall it is set in."<br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna says, "Example would be @desc &lt;exit dbref&gt;=Set in the northern<br/>wall of Grinna's Room this plain oak door awaits to lead you out to the<br/>Building Lab."<br/> <br/>Futuristic Worlds;FU;Out;o/DESCRIBE - Set.<br/> <br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna says, "Here again this description can be built upon and<br/>expanded..

Is there a<br/>window next to the door.. is the door sitting in the light or dark.. All<br/>manner of things may be described in your exit description."<br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna says, "Okay, everyone.. take a few minutes to desc your rooms and<br/>exits.. and then take a 5 minute break... which means a 10 minute break for<br/>me. :)	Let me know when you are done."<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Mee says, "Ok."

Okay.

Please read help @lock"<br/> <br/>@LOCK<br/>  @lock[/&lt;switch&gt;] &lt;object&gt;=&lt;key&gt; <br/>  <br/>  This command "locks" the object, specifying (by the key) who or what can<br/>  do certain things with the object. There are many different types of locks,<br/>  all of which are described in "help locktypes" and which are designated by<br/>  the switch. The "basic" lock determines, for players and objects, who can<br/>  pick them up. For exits, it determines who can go through the exit.<br/>  All other locks can be set the same way as the basic lock.<br/>  <br/>  Whenever you "pass" the basic lock, you succeed in doing something with<br/>  the object. This triggers the @success/@osuccess/@asuccess<br/>  messages and actions. If you fail to pass the basic lock, you trigger<br/>  the @failure/@ofailure/@afailure messages and actions. Other locktypes<br/>  may also have such success/failure messages.<br/>  <br/>  You can specify &lt;object&gt; and &lt;key&gt; as either the name of an object in<br/>  the immediate area, a DBREF number, "me", or "here". <br/>  <br/> (continued in help @lock2)  <br/> <br/>@LOCK2<br/>  You can lock an object in several different ways. The simplest lock is to<br/>  lock it to one other thing:<br/><br/>   @lock My Toy = = me<br/><br/>     This locks the object "My Toy" to you and you alone. It is recommended<br/>     that you @lock me == me in order to prevent anyone else from picking<br/>     you up. The two = signs are NOT a typo!<br/>  <br/>  You can lock an object -against- one other object as well, using the '!' <br/>  symbol:<br/> <br/>   @lock Shared Toy = !Vector Sigma<br/><br/>      This locks the object "Shared Toy" to everyone -except- Vector Sigma.<br/>      Everyone except Vector will be able to pick up the object.<br/>  <br/> (continued in help @lock3)<br/> <br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna says, "For today..we will concentrate on using a simple lock for<br/>your exit...One that will allow only you or yourself and a list of friends to<br/>use your exit.	:)"<br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna says, "The example here shows the simplest way to lock an exit or<br/>an object.  For our use it would be <br/><br/>@lock[/&lt;switch&gt;] &lt;object&gt;=&lt;key&gt;<br/>"<br/> <br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna says, "For this class we will not discuss the switch.  Which<br/>makes the basic command for our purposes:  @lock &lt;object&gt;=&lt;key&gt;"<br/> <br/>&lt;101&gt; Grinna says, "&lt;key&gt; can be anything. It can be a flag, an object carried<br/>about or (for our purposes) a name. A simple lock is:<br/><br/>@lock &lt;exit dbref&gt;=me<br/><br/>To extend this, and allow your friends access to your room you can add names.<br/>For example:<br/><br/>@lock &lt;exit dbref&gt;=me|*Grinna|*Halatir|*Trispis<br/><br/>You may continue adding or removing names in this manner as you see fit.
