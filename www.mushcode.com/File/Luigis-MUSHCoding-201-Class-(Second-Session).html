Or are there more?"<br/>* Luigi says, "There are only 10 numbered registers, but there are many more."<br/>* Luigi says, "For instance, %n returns the name of the person who calls it."<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say %n<br/>* Luigi says, "Luigi"<br/>XML nods.<br/>* Luigi says, "%# returns the DBREF. %p returns 'his', 'her', or 'it' depending on the caller's @SEX."<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say %# %n %p<br/>* Luigi says, "#1000 Luigi his"<br/>* Luigi says, "So in code, instead of using 'say', you could use @PEMIT combined with %#."<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; @pemit %#=Only %n(%#) is seeing this message.<br/>* Luigi says, "In a $-Command, %# is the DBREF of the person who typed it, so you can @pemit directly to that person this way."<br/>Phil_Laco has arrived.<br/>Mysterious box has left.<br/>Phil_Laco takes Mysterious box.<br/>* Luigi says, "Everyone understand?"<br/>Phil_Laco has left.<br/>Rhayden nods.<br/>XML nods.<br/>XML says, "Hey.."<br/>XML says, "Which should we use?"<br/>XML says, "%n OR %#?"<br/>Faizah prefers %#<br/>XML says, "Is any particular one faster?"<br/>XML says, "Or is it just a personal prefernce?"<br/>* Luigi says, "Only use %#."<br/>XML says, "Oh?"<br/>* Luigi says, "If you're using @pemits. Here's why."<br/>XML says, "Wait, I know why."<br/>XML says, "Objects named the same thing."<br/>XML says, "There can't be more than one dbref"<br/>* Luigi says, "%n may be "Luigi", but if there's an object "Luigi's Puppet" in the same room, @pemit won't know which one to @pemit to."<br/>XML says, "But many things can be named a particular thing."<br/>XML nods.<br/>* Luigi says, "But %n can be useful in exits and such."<br/>* Luigi says, "Now, onward."<br/>* Luigi says, "User-defined registers are % registers than can be set to something, and later recalled."<br/>* Luigi says, "For instance:"<br/>47 is the number<br/>47 times two is 94<br/>Illmuri has disconnected.<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; &amp;test me=$test:say [setr(1,rand(50))] is the number;say %q1 times two is [mul(%q1,2)]<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; test<br/>* Luigi says, "36 is the number"<br/>* Luigi says, "36 times two is 72"<br/>* Luigi says, "29 is the number"<br/>* Luigi says, "29 times two is 58"<br/>* Luigi says, "20 is the number"<br/>* Luigi says, "20 times two is 40"<br/>Rhayden says, "Hey, nifty."<br/>Rhayden says, "It's like algebra."<br/>* Luigi says, "I used the SETR() function to place the value of RAND(50) into user-register "1", and then recalled it twice with "%q1"."<br/>* Luigi says, "The format of SETR() is: SETR(&lt;register&gt;,&lt;value&gt;)"<br/>XML raise hand<br/>XML says, "Can use just use 0-9?"<br/>* Luigi says, "Yes XML?"<br/>XML says, "Or can you use A-Z?"<br/>* Luigi says, "%0 is different from %q0."<br/>XML says, "No, I know."<br/>XML says, "But can you specify more than just 0-9?"<br/>* Luigi says, "I'm getting there, hold up."<br/>XML nods.<br/>Rhayden says, "Could i do setr(foobar,num(me)) ?"<br/>* Luigi says, "The format of the register to recall it is %q&lt;register&gt;. So %q1 recalls "1"."<br/>* Luigi says, "Now, let us discuss &lt;register&gt;."<br/>* Luigi says, "&lt;register&gt; can only be 1 character in length. So "foobar" is too long."<br/>Rhayden nods, ok.<br/>Illmuri has connected.<br/>* Luigi says, "It can be 0-9 on all MU* servers."<br/>* Luigi says, "On PennMUSH and TinyBit, and in the future MUX maybe, it can be A-Z."<br/>* Luigi says, "So.."<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say [setr(1,rand(100))] [setr(A,rand(100))] [setr(Q,rand(100))] %q1 %qA %qQ<br/>* Luigi says, "74 87 75 74 87 75"<br/>* Luigi says, "It isn't case sensative. There is no difference between 'a' and 'A' in user-registers."<br/>* Luigi says, "However, sometimes in normal game registers there is. %N and %n for example."<br/>* Luigi says, "%N always capitalizes the name of the player, even if it is lowercase. Same with %P."<br/>* Luigi says, "SETR(), or "set register", also has a brother. SETQ()."<br/>Illmuri says, "mux uses va-vz"<br/>* Luigi says, "No it doesn't Illmuri. Not for local-registers."<br/>* Luigi says, "%va-%vz allows you to grab the VA-VZ attributes on an object though."<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; &amp;va me=corndogs<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say %va<br/>* Luigi says, "corndogs"<br/>Illmuri says, "oh, yeah i see"<br/>* Luigi says, "SETR(), set register, has a brother. SETQ(). The Q most likely stands for 'quiet'."<br/>* Luigi says, "Because it sets the register, without showing it like SETR does."<br/>Illmuri says, "nod"<br/>Illmuri says, "i tried it out just now"<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say [setq(A,balloon)][setq(B,animals)][setq(C,rule)]%qa %qb %qc<br/>* Luigi says, "balloon animals rule"<br/>* Luigi says, "And if we had used SETR instead.."<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say [setr(A,balloon)][setr(B,animals)][setr(C,rule)]%qa %qb %qc<br/>* Luigi says, "balloonanimalsruleballoon animals rule"<br/>Rhayden says, "So what is the use of using setr() then?"<br/>* Luigi says, "Saves space sometimes."<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; @swi/first setr(A,rand(100))=&gt;50,{say %qA is greater than 50.},{say %qB is less than 50.}<br/>* Luigi says, "74 is greater than 50."<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; @swi/first [setq(A,rand(100))]%qA=&gt;50,{say %qA is greater than 50.},{say %qB is less than 50.}<br/>* Luigi says, "77 is greater than 50."<br/>* Luigi says, "Both methods work, but the first was shorter."<br/>* Luigi says, "User registers are very useful for storing something you might otherwise have to calculate multiple times in a function."<br/>Rhayden NODS<br/>Rhayden says, "I've run into that before."<br/>* Luigi says, "Function, or a command. Sorry."<br/>* Luigi says, "Now, we learned about ITER() last week. Let's combine both ITER() and user registers."<br/>Shadow-Link has arrived.<br/>Shadow-Link coughs.<br/>* Luigi says, "I'm going to generate 100 random numbers between 1-50 first."<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say iter(lnum(1,100),rand(50))<br/>* Luigi says, "26 17 9 41 49 4 8 5 1 23 47 35 16 28 22 44 18 37 0 44 13 23 6 9 12 39 46 34 49 40 12 13 15 14 33 13 34 36 16 21 38 19 13 34 33 7 43 37 0 42 36 19 27 11 20 28 18 36 39 25 27 20 21 23 3 29 5 34 1 44 23 47 6 29 18 26 48 2 20 36 31 48 31 39 38 11 37 31 45 10 34 46 0 11 8 5 49 46 35 32"<br/>* Luigi says, "Now, I want to add all of the numbers I generate up into a register, and then show it."<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say [iter(lnum(1,100),setq(A,add(%qA,rand(50))))]%qA<br/>* Luigi says, "                                                                                                   2146"<br/>Shadow-Link says, "You beast."<br/>Rhayden says, "Why was there all the empty space?"<br/>Illmuri says, "thats how much link gets whipped"<br/>Illmuri says, "cause the spaces of iter"<br/>* Luigi says, "Notice the many spaces. That is because our Delimiter in the Iter defaulted to space, since we didn't tell it otherwise. So now I will add the 3rd and 4th arguments to get rid of the spaces, telling it we want to use nothing as the output seperator."<br/>* Luigi says, "Note: A Delimiter given nothing will assume a space, as a delimiter can not be less than one character in length. An output seperator can be nothing, however."<br/>Illmuri says, "thats all the spaces in between each of 50 numbers"<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say [iter(lnum(1,100),setq(A,add(%qA,rand(50))),,)]%qA<br/>* Luigi says, "2293"<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say [iter(lnum(1,100),setq(A,add(%qA,rand(50))),,)]%qA<br/>* Luigi says, "2606"<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say [iter(lnum(1,100),setq(A,add(%qA,rand(50))),,)]%qA<br/>* Luigi says, "2418"<br/>* Luigi says, "Now that we've seen a good example of Iter() and User Registers, I should let you know that what we just did was not necessary for the following reason: LMATH()."<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say lmath(add,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)<br/>* Luigi says, "55"<br/>* Luigi says, "But for the sake of example, we didn't use it."<br/>* Luigi says, "Now, any questions before I move on?"<br/>Rhayden says, "Nope, not really."<br/>Faizah is fine.<br/>Illmuri says, "what are common uses?"<br/>* Luigi says, "In Iter()'s as I've described, and @Switches. Consider this.."<br/>* Luigi says, "We usually @Switch on one argument, which would allow us to use #$ to grab what we switched on. But.."<br/>Faizah will speak up if she has questions. But otherwise remain silent to keep log small.<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; @Switch/first [setr(1,rand(100))]|[gt(%q1,50)]=100|*,{say Arg two is equal to 100!},*|1,{say Arg two (%q1) is greater than 50.},{say Arg two (%q1) is not greater than fifty.}<br/>* Luigi says, "Arg two (80) is greater than 50."<br/>* Luigi says, "I put two things on the switch. By placing the random number is %q1, I was more easily able to access it later. I could have also done something like first(#$,|), but this was easier."<br/>* Luigi says, "In more complex coding you'll probably find uses for SETR/SETQ."<br/>Rhayden has a question<br/>* Luigi says, "Yes?"<br/>Rhayden says, "What are you checking against with "100|*" ?"<br/>* Luigi says, "If the random number is equal to 100, and then a |, and then anything else. * is a wildcard."<br/>* Luigi says, "Oh, just for a note, rand(100) will never be equal to 100, because Rand(100) returns a random number in the range of 0 to 99."<br/>* Luigi says, "But that was my oversight."<br/>Rhayden says, "Oh, ok, I get it now."<br/>* Luigi says, "Now, User Defined Functions. We've played with game functions. Our first were the basic math functions if I remember correctly, ADD() and so forth."<br/>* Luigi says, "Functions take arguments, up to 10, which are placed in the %0-%9 registers accordingly."<br/>* Luigi says, "User-Defined Functions that is."<br/>* Luigi says, "A quick example:"<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; &amp;sum me=add(%0,%1)<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say u(me/sum,10,10)<br/>* Luigi says, "20"<br/>* Luigi says, "The U() function, which is an alias for UFUN(), stands for User Function."<br/>* Luigi says, "It takes an attribute, and calls it as a function. You can pass up to 10 variables to it, which will be placed in %0, %1.. up to %9."<br/>* Luigi says, "There is no error checking for amount of arguments it takes, so.."<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say u(me/sum,1,2,3)<br/>* Luigi says, "3"<br/>* Luigi says, "It received the third argument, "3", into %2. Even though it never did anything with it."<br/>* Luigi says, "Questions?"<br/>Rhayden says, "I assume the no error-checking goes the other way too?"<br/>* Luigi says, "Hmm?"<br/>Illmuri says, "prolly 0"<br/>XML raises hand<br/>Rhayden says, "As in, if my function requires three arguments and i only give it two, it just adds the first two?"<br/>* Luigi says, "Yes XML?"<br/>XML says, "How big can @switch/switch() es get?"<br/>XML says, "I mean, what's the maximum size"<br/>XML says, "?"<br/>* Luigi says, "Right. It would just pass nothing to %2, and your user-function would try to use a blank %2."<br/>XML says, "I mean, can you have 10, 15, 20 arguements?"<br/>* Luigi says, "Very big, XML."<br/>Rhayden says, "Function invocation limit is 4096, yes?"<br/>Rhayden says, "Er, or am I thinking of function recursion limit"<br/>* Luigi says, "I have never tested, but let's try something quickly"<br/>(Performs a few tests)<br/>* Luigi says, "Interesting. Well, you'll probably never reach that limit, so don't worry about it."<br/>* Luigi says, "Now, let's try a more complex User Function."<br/>XML saves that code for offensive purposes :)<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; &amp;test me=iter(%0,##[setq(T,add(%qT,##))],,+)=%qT<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say u(me/test,1 2 3)<br/>* Luigi says, "1+2+3=6"<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say u(me/test,1 2 3 4 5)<br/>* Luigi says, "1+2+3+4+5=15"<br/>* Luigi says, "Now, let's discuss the format of U()."<br/>* Luigi says, "U()'s format is simply this.. U(&lt;target&gt;/&lt;name of attribute&gt;)"<br/>* Luigi says, "Any further arguments after this are sent to the %0 to %9 registers. So up to 10 further arguments can be provided."<br/>* Luigi says, "U(), like SETR and SETQ, has a brother."<br/>* Luigi says, "Perhaps a sister. You can't really tell."<br/>* Luigi says, "ULOCAL()"<br/>* Luigi says, "The difference? User Registers (setr/setq) are passed when a U() calls an attribute. If I set something with SETQ/SETR prior to calling it, it gets passed to the attribute I call with U()."<br/>* Luigi says, "ULOCAL() makes sure the registers effected in the user function called do NOT effect what called it, thus keeping them local."<br/>Rhayden says, "I'm not sure I follow."<br/>Shadow-Link says, "is V() like U()?"<br/>Illmuri says, "u calls a function. v merely shows an attribute"<br/>* Luigi says, "If I set %qL to something while in a "ULOCAL", it doesn't effect what called it."<br/>* Luigi says, "But if it's a U(), it can effect it."<br/>Illmuri says, "u does code, v just displays the code"<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; &amp;red me=[ulocal(me/blue)] %qB<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; &amp;blue me=setq(B,the color blue)<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say u(me/red)<br/>* Luigi says, " "<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; &amp;red me=[u(me/blue)] %qB<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say u(me/red)<br/>* Luigi says, " the color blue"<br/>Shadow-Link says, "what about "<br/>XML says, "Yes, what -about-  ""<br/>XML ducks :)<br/>Shadow-Link types --&gt; &amp;red me=[get(me/blue)] %qB<br/>Shadow-Link says, "Shtup XML."<br/>* Luigi says, "Link, get() doesn't evaluate what it grabs. U() does."<br/>XML was just joking, sar.<br/>Illmuri says, "help v() help get() help u()"<br/>XML says, "I have to idle for a minute. If Imiss anything important, tell me."<br/>* Luigi says, "So to summarize ULOCAL and U, if you want to use SETR/SETQ in a User Function you are calling, and don't want it to mess up any you have already set, use ULOCAL. Otherwise, use U."<br/>Rhayden says, "Lemme get this straight"<br/>Rhayden says, "I've got a function that sets  to blue."<br/>Rhayden says, "I've got a function that sets %qB to blue."<br/>XML re's<br/>Rhayden says, "If I use ulocal(), I could calculate something else using the register %qB, then call %qb and it would still say blue?"<br/>XML nods.<br/>XML says, "case-insensitive."<br/>Rhayden says, "Awright, I think I got it."<br/>* Luigi says, "Correct."<br/>Rhayden says, "Public and private variables, for us Java programmers."<br/>XML says, "It doesn't care about your case."<br/>* Luigi says, "U() and ULOCAL()'s first argument, the &lt;target&gt;/&lt;attribute&gt; one, can also accept simply &lt;attribute&gt;. If you provide u(red) instead of u(me/red), it will default the target to the person who calls it. So it would default to you."<br/>XML says, "Today on Oprah: MUSH functions that don't care about your case."<br/>Rhayden says, "Public and private variables, for us Java programmers."<br/>Rhayden says, "Whoops"<br/>* Luigi says, "If any of you feel like a little extra reading, have a look at U's cousin, UDEFAULT(), and his great-aunt EDEFAULT(). But let's move on. I want to discuss one last topic tonight."<br/>Shadow-Link says, "We just recently started on Java... very repetitive if you don't use loops."<br/>* Luigi says, "The SORT() function. Which is often useful when using ITER() and such."<br/>* Luigi says, "SORT() takes a list, which may be seperated by a Delimiter, and sorts it into an order."<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say sort(9 5 3 7 10 1 13)<br/>* Luigi says, "1 3 5 7 9 10 13"<br/>* Luigi says, "You can provide a second argument, of a single letter, telling it how to sort it."<br/>* Luigi says, "By providing no second argument, it tries to guess how you wanted it sorted. It usually does a good job. Options for how you can sort it include 'f' for decimal (f = floating point) values, 'a' for lexicographically, and more. See HELP SORT() for this list."<br/>* Luigi says, "The homework for next class is going to combine all of the things we talked about today. You may want to refer to my averaging example."<br/>* Luigi says, "I don't want you using LMATH(), though after this assignment you would probably be best to use LMATH() when possible. :)"<br/>* Luigi says, "For the following assignment, GT() and LT() may come in handy as well. Here it is:"<br/>* Luigi says, "PROJECT 2: Advanced Calculator (15)"<br/>* Luigi says, "Create an object which combines registers, local functions, and"<br/>* Luigi says, "iter() to provide the following commands: 'average &lt;list of numbers&gt;',"<br/>* Luigi says, "'largest &lt;list of numbers&gt;' (returns the largest number), and 'sum"<br/>* Luigi says, "&lt;list of numbers&gt;' (returns the total of the numbers added together)."<br/>* Luigi says, "Also provide a command for sorting a list of decimal numbers, such as"<br/>* Luigi says, "'sort &lt;list of numbers&gt;'."<br/>* Luigi says, "And, for you overacchievers:"<br/>* Luigi says, "EXTRA CREDIT: Calculator Extras (5 points)"<br/>* Luigi says, "Give the calculator a command 'graphlist &lt;list of numbers ranging from"<br/>* Luigi says, "1 to 10&gt;' which shows you an ASCII, ANSI or FANSI display of the list"<br/>* Luigi says, "of numbers given to it."<br/>Illmuri says, "ugh, not math... i got to calculus and that was enough"<br/>* Luigi says, "HELP MATH FUNCTIONS may prove useful. GT() and LT() will be your greatest pals most likely."<br/>Rhayden says, "Mmmm, extra credit. :)"<br/>* Luigi says, "Don't kill yourself over the extra credit, I'm not sure if you guys are up to the level or not yet. It's just something I thought I'd throw out there and see. :)"<br/>XML says, "When's this due?"<br/>Illmuri says, "EC is easy"<br/>* Luigi says, "Does anyone want to meet this Wednesday? Or shall we try next Saturday, or pass for a few weeks in light of the holidays?"<br/>Faizah considers the extra credit... Yeah, I think I could do it. The code might be ugly, but I could do something.<br/>XML says, "sATURDAY"<br/>XML says, "Please... I've got a -ton- of stuff on monday, tuesday and wednesday."<br/>Mysterious box rocks back and forth.<br/>Illmuri says, "sat works"<br/>Rhayden says, "Next Saturday works for me"<br/>Faizah nods.<br/>Illmuri says, "its not too close to holidays"<br/>Illmuri says, "sigh"<br/>* Luigi says, "Alright, next Saturday. Thank you everyone for showing up. My email is eightbitmush@hotmail.com if you have questions."<br/>Illmuri says, "sure we have to use iter?"<br/>Illmuri says, "not mean()?"<br/>* Luigi says, "Yep. Look at my example for showing the total."<br/>* Luigi says, "Mean() won't work Illmuri, because they are providing a list of numbers."<br/>Illmuri says, "hmm"<br/>* Luigi says, "You can't do mean(%0). It expects Mean(1,2,3)."<br/>Illmuri says, "oh"<br/>Illmuri says, "thats not all that great then"<br/>Rhayden says, "Heh, got the graph done already. :)"<br/>* Luigi says, "And I want to be able to give it any number of numbers from say.. 2 to 100. So no massive switches. Use ITER() to do it and it'll be slick."<br/>XML nods. Aye,<br/>Illmuri goes home.<br/>Illmuri has left.<br/>Rhayden says, "I like learning to mushcode because: a.), i can do nifty things here."<br/>XML says, "Hey now, I knewe how to mushcode before,"<br/>XML says, "I could get it to pemit "Hi" when you typed sayhi."<br/>* Luigi says, "In my opinion at least. I never knew how to use them until after a long time coding."<br/>XML stands tall.<br/>Rhayden says, "And b.) it helps me put thought into a programming format. Helps me out with other languages, like Java and such."<br/>* Luigi says, "Heh XML"<br/>XML says, "And The IC p... err... project is going to start he coding phase tonight."<br/>Shadow-Link says, "I can't understand why the teacher wants use to use for loops for everything in Java."<br/>XML says, "I can say no more unless I get authorisation."<br/>Link has connected.<br/>
