She has pulled one side of her skirt up and tucked it in at the waist, displaying her finely-curved legs and the dusty tops of her bare feet.%r%rThis poor girl is obviously over-worked. She has a basket over one arm heaped with cut flowers and ripe peaches, she's pushing a wheeled barrel with the word "pickles" carved into it, and there's a "T"-shaped pole attached to the barrel from which dried flower garlands hang. It's all quite a load for her to move around with.%r%rYou can 'buy' one of several products from [u(wench-name)]: 'flower','pickle','peach', or 'garland' ('buy &lt;product&gt;').%rYou can also ask her to 'serve' you something from the food court: 'turkey leg','stir fry'(veggie), or 'steak on a stick' ('serve &lt;food&gt;')%r<br/>@VA Wandering Wench=^* has arrived.:@trigger me/who-works;@switch u(%#/sex)=f*,{@wait 2=@trig me/femit-trig=%N},m*,{@wait 2=@trig me/memit-trig=%N}<br/>&amp;MEMIT-TRIG Wandering Wench=@remit here= [switch(rand(10),0,[u(wench-name)] the Wandering Wench approaches %0 and says "Would M'lord like to buy a pretty flower for someone special?".,1,[u(wench-name)] the Wandering Wench approaches %0 and licks her lips suggestively before saying "Would M'lord like to buy a tasty pickle?".,2,[u(wench-name)] the Wandering Wench approaches %0 and says "Would M'lord like to buy a garland for a pretty lady?".,3,[u(wench-name)] the Wandering Wench elbows her way through the crowd yelling "Make way...make way for [switch(rand(4),0,Lord David Silverbow,1, Sir Gunther von Falkenchild,2, Master of the Laurel Jean-Luc d'Lys,3, Master of the Pelican Sir Eberwolf the Saxon)]",4,[u(wench-name)] the Wandering Wench approaches %0 and inhales deeply.
