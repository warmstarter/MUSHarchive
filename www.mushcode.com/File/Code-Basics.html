        Topic: Code Basics<br/>Author: Trispis<br/>Summary: MUSH 101's first instructional lecture. Recommended for anyone<br/>who has an interest in learning to code or build.<br/><br/>8/23/97<br/><br/>Trispis begins his lecture...<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Welcome to MUSH 101's first official online class."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "I will be your instructor for this class."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "My name is Trispis."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "You may call me Trispis."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "If you don't have a pencil and a few sheets of paper handy,<br/>please go get them now. I won't be making you write essays, but I will be<br/>pointing out some useful commands or help files that are worth keeping handy<br/>(humor me... get a pencil and paper). I'll wait 2 minutes before continuing,<br/>for those who wish to go get these supplies."<br/><br/>Trispis clears his throat, then continues, "The title of today's lesson is<br/>'Code Basics: tools of the trade'.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "We will be learning the basic skills for looking at, writing,<br/>and modifying code. I suppose the most important thing, though, will be the<br/>language skills you'll be exposed to here. Coding and discussing code involve<br/>some terms and abbreviations which are fairly standard on most MU*'s. In<br/>today's lesson, you'll be exposed to all of the basic terms of the coding<br/>art."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "By the end of the class, we will have covered the basic<br/>concepts which comprise the greater part of coding... AND... by the end of the<br/>class you will have applied many of these concepts in the creation of an<br/>object (yes, you actually get to make something today). The stuff we do today<br/>should prepare you to do some code either on your own or with a little<br/>guidance from an experienced coder (without feeling horribly selfconscious or<br/>insecure)."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "At times, the class may seem to move very quickly. At other<br/>times, it might seem to move too slowly. Either way, please follow the<br/>guidelines for orderliness in the classroom. This will allow everyone the<br/>opportunity to ask questions and receive answers in an organized fashion."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Are there any questions before we begin? (please use the +code<br/>channel when asking questions)"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "If there are no questions, let's get to work. (:"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "First things first. The 'help' files for PennMUSH are cryptic<br/>and incomprehensible. We will be using them a lot. (evil grin)"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "A great deal of my purpose today is to assist you in<br/>understanding the way PennMUSH's help files are written. Therefore, each time<br/>I introduce a new command or subject, if it is listed in 'help', I will use<br/>that help file as our working model."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "The first two things we need to learn are the commands which<br/>allow us to look at code."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "They are: 'brief' and 'examine'"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Because 'brief' is the least powerful of the two, we will look<br/>at it first."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Please type (and read): help brief"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Note two things about this help file."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "First... note the first two words of the file are: brief<br/>&lt;object&gt;."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "This is the SYNTAX of the 'brief' command. That is to say, it<br/>is how you type the command when you want to use it (syntax). Almost all of<br/>PennMUSH's help files give you the syntax first. Look for it. As you gain<br/>experience, it might be all you need to remind you how a command works. (:"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Note the way the word &lt;object&gt; is surrounded by &lt;&gt;'s. What this<br/>means is that you need to provide this information."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "An &lt;object&gt; can be any one of the following things:<br/><br/>the name of an object in your inventory<br/>the name of an object in your same location<br/>the name of a player in your same location<br/>the name, or a valid alias, of an exit<br/>your name<br/>me (a valid reference to yourself)<br/>here (a valid reference to your current location)<br/>any #dbref (a database reference number)<br/>"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "When we enter an &lt;object&gt;, we don't include the &lt;&gt;'s."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Note: I will discuss object TYPES later."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "The second thing this help file refers to is its relationship<br/>with 'examine'."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "'brief' and 'examine' are partners in crime. ... er... code."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "We will look at 'examine' in a moment. For now, though, let's<br/>see what sort of information the 'brief' command gives us..."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Type: brief me"<br/><br/>------ DO THIS ----  ^^^^^^^^<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Woohoo. Look at all that juicy information. (:"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "I'll give you a moment to look at it, then I'll discuss some of<br/>the key points of interest."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "We'll talk about all of these things eventually, but for now<br/>please take notice of the following things in this display..."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "At the very top, your name..."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "...followed by some stuff in parentheses (&lt;a number&gt;&lt;some<br/>letters&gt;)."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "The number is /your/ #dbref (database reference number)."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "The letters are your flags (which are also listed in word-form<br/>on the next line of the display, right underneath). We'll talk about flags<br/>later."<br/><br/><br/>&lt;Code&gt; Erinstar says, "I cant do 'brief me'"<br/><br/>&lt;Code&gt; Trispis hrms.<br/><br/>&lt;Code&gt; Trispis says, "Try: br me"<br/><br/>&lt;Code&gt; Erinstar says, "That worked :)"<br/><br/>&lt;Code&gt; Trispis says, "Good. (:"<br/><br/>Trispis continues...<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Moving downward through the display, we also see these other<br/>things...<br/><br/>Owner (again, your name should be here) Flags (in word form)<br/>Zone (should be *NOTHING*) Credits (MUSH "money" for building and creating)<br/>Locks (if you have locks besides a Basic one, they'll be here, too)<br/>Powers (you should see: Builder)<br/>Channels (all channels you're on. you should see at least: Freshmen)<br/>Warnings checked (some MUSH stuff you'll probably never use)<br/>Created (the date and time that your character was created)<br/>Carrying (objects you are carrying - i.e., your 'inventory')<br/>Home (Where your character is linked into the database. #0 is valid)<br/>Location (Where you currently are. Here. Classroom 1101)<br/>"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Later in the class I'll refer to a few more of these things.<br/>For now, though, let's move onward to 'examine' (brief's partner)."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Read: help examine"<br/><br/>EXAMINE<br/>  examine[/&lt;switch&gt;] &lt;object&gt;[/&lt;attribute&gt;]<br/><br/>  Displays all available information about &lt;object&gt;.  &lt;object&gt; may be an<br/>  object, 'me' or 'here'. You must control the object to examine it.  If<br/>  you do not own the object, or it is not visible, you will just see the<br/>  name of the object's owner.  May be abbreviated 'ex &lt;object&gt;'.  If the<br/>  attribute parameter is given, you will only see that attribute (good<br/>  for looking at code). You can now wild-card match on attributes.  For<br/>  example. to see all the attributes that began with a 'v' you could do<br/>  ex &lt;object&gt;/v*<br/><br/>  Examine takes three switches, "brief"  (equivalent to the "brief" command),<br/>  "debug", which is a wizard-only switch, and "mortal".  "debug" examine<br/>  will show the raw values for certain fields in an object. "mortal"<br/>  examine will show an object as if you were a mortal and not the object's<br/>  owner. It's primarily useful to admins.<br/><br/>&lt;Code&gt; Higs says, "I don't have Builder listed under Powers."<br/><br/>&lt;Code&gt; Erinstar says, "me either."<br/><br/>&lt;Code&gt; Trispis says, "Good point. Builder is not required in our current<br/>configuration. Some MUSHes require it, though."<br/><br/>&lt;Code&gt; Higs says, "Ah."<br/><br/>&lt;Code&gt; Trispis says, "Everyone ready to move on to 'examine'?"<br/><br/>&lt;Code&gt; Higs nods.<br/><br/>&lt;Code&gt; Calico says, "Aye!"<br/><br/>&lt;Code&gt; Trispis says, "Okay... type: help examine"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "First thing to note is its syntax is somewhat cryptic looking."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Note stuff right after the word 'examine' at the top of the<br/>screen. Something like this...<br/><br/>examine[/&lt;switch&gt;] &lt;object&gt;[/&lt;attribute&gt;]<br/>"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "This is the most confusing part of PennMUSH's help system...<br/>the syntax. Let's walk through examine's syntax a step at a time..."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "First, we have the command itself: examine"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Nothing particularly difficult here."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Next we have: [/&lt;switch&gt;]"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Okay... this is our introduction to 'optional' information in<br/>command syntax. In PennMUSH's help syntax, the square brackets denote<br/>'optional' information that the command will accept. (Note right now,<br/>though... In actual coding, the square brackets serve a different purpose,<br/>which I will discuss toward the end of the class. For now, though, just note<br/>that they are used in this manner in the help SYNTAX.)"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Look at the last paragraph of 'help examine'. It says, 'Examine<br/>takes three switches...' and explains them a bit. The thing to note here is<br/>that only /one/ of these switches applies to mortals (you). That switch is:<br/>/brief ... which, as they explain, is the same as the 'brief' command. So...<br/>in our study of 'brief' and 'examine', we have the convenience of being able<br/>to ignore switches for the moment (Whew! Aren't you glad?). We'll apply some<br/>switches later, but for now, let's proceed with 'examine'."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "I've probably spammed 'help examine' off the screen. And, since<br/>I've got more to discuss about this file before we use the command, it's<br/>probably a good idea to get the help file back onscreen. So, again type: help<br/>examine"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "We're still studying the syntax...<br/><br/>examine[/&lt;switch&gt;] &lt;object&gt;[/&lt;attribute&gt;]<br/>"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "After the optional [/&lt;switch], we see &lt;object&gt;. We've already<br/>covered the basics of what is considered valid input for an &lt;object&gt;, so the<br/>only thing I'll say this time is that the examine command requires an &lt;object&gt;<br/>(i.e., &lt;object&gt; is /not/ optional)."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "After the (required) &lt;object&gt;, we see another optional<br/>parameter (a parameter is some defining element of a command... it's no big<br/>deal, it's just a fancy word)... [/&lt;attribute&gt;]."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Again, I remind you that square brackets in help syntax<br/>indicate optional parameters (coders use these fancy fancy words, so get used<br/>to them)."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Okay... what about this [/&lt;attribute&gt;] thing... What is it?<br/>(That's a rhetorical question. I know what it is. (; Heh.)"<br/><br/>Calico giggles.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Well... I guess the way to learn this stuff is to do it, so<br/>let's back up a bit and go through this a step at a time until we're back<br/>where we are (confused? good. it'll make sense in a minute... I just need to<br/>get your momentum built up)..."<br/><br/><br/>Trispis says, "Do: brief me"<br/><br/><br/><br/>Trispis says, "Now, do: examine/brief me"<br/><br/><br/><br/>Trispis says, "Note: the above two commands are, as the help files indicated,<br/>identical."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Now do: examine me (without the /brief switch)"<br/><br/><br/><br/>Trispis says, "Yeehaw! Look at the spam. (:"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Okay... What just happened is... examine showed you /everything<br/>you can see/ about your character's code."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "This is where the [/&lt;attribute&gt;] switch comes in real handy. (:<br/>Try this, next... type: examine me/describe"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Note: This time, the only thing returned was your 'describe'<br/>attribute."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Thus, you can examine individual attributes separately by<br/>specifying a /&lt;attribute&gt;. This is very useful when you have lots of<br/>attributes on an object."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Okay... a couple more things, then I'll take some questions<br/>before moving on to other subjects."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "First... both 'brief' and 'examine' have abbreviations (coders<br/>are lazy)."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Although PennMUSH is sufficiently developed to accept just<br/>about any number of the first few letters of a command, it isn't wise to get<br/>too lazy. So, I'll recommend the following abbreviations...<br/><br/>for 'brief', use 'br' (example: br me)<br/>and<br/>for 'examine', use 'ex' (example: ex me/describe)."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Okay. The last thing about 'examine', before taking questions,<br/>is... wildcards. The help file mentioned this, so let's read it again. Type:<br/>help examine"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Near the end of the first paragraph, it says 'You can now<br/>wild-card match on attributes.' and gives you an example."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "There are two valid wildcards in PennMUSH. One is the asterisk<br/>(*). The other is the question mark (?). The asterisk replaces any combination<br/>of characters, and the question mark replaces any single character. They may<br/>be used individually or in combination."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Examples...."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "ex me/des* (this would look for any attribute names beginning<br/>with 'des'... like: describe, descent, desk, destination, dessert, etc... and<br/>list anything and/or everything it finds)"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "ex me/?ouse (this would look for any attribute names that are<br/>five characters in length and end in 'ouse'... like: house, mouse, louse (but<br/>not grouse or firehouse)... and list anything and/or everything it finds)"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "ex me/p?s* (this would look for any attribute names that begin<br/>with 'p', followed by any single character (but /not/ 'nothing'), followed by<br/>'s', followed by anything (including 'nothing')... like: pos, position, past,<br/>pass, p1s, p_set, etc... and list anything and/or everything it finds)."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "We'll see the benefit of wildcards a bit later, but for now I<br/>have simply explained them for your information (FYI)."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Also, FYI (For Your Information)... if you use both the /brief<br/>switch and an /&lt;attribute&gt;, you'll only get the attribute (without the /brief<br/>information). So, the /brief switch is pretty much useless... use the 'brief'<br/>command if you want that information, and use 'examine' if you want attribute<br/>information."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "It's time for questions... please use the +code channel."<br/><br/>&lt;Code&gt; Morpheus says, "Understood perfectly well...no questions from me."<br/><br/>&lt;Code&gt; Higs says, "When we ask questions, are we supposed to just blurt them<br/>out on this channel, or raise our hand and then blurt them out?"<br/><br/>&lt;Code&gt; Trispis says, "Blurting is acceptible on this channel. (:"<br/><br/>&lt;Code&gt; Higs says, "OK. That's my only question."<br/><br/>&lt;Code&gt; Erinstar says, "Why is coding so complicated :)"<br/><br/><br/>Higs resists the urge to shoot a spit wad at Erinstar.<br/>Morpheus cackles.<br/><br/>&lt;Code&gt; Trispis grins. Because they made the 'help files' so complicated. (:<br/>And... I'm getting ready to simplify it for you in the next portion of the<br/>lecture. (:<br/><br/>&lt;Code&gt; Trispis says, "If there are no more questions, I'll get back to the<br/>lecture..."<br/><br/>&lt;Code&gt; Trispis continues the lecture.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Okay... Believe it or not, we've already mastered one of the<br/>hardest parts of coding: reading the PennMUSH help syntax."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Although there are still a few details left to discuss about<br/>syntax, we are now prepared to read and, for the most part, understand help<br/>files."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "And since we have achieved this mastery of syntax, let's take<br/>advantage of it."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "It's time for you to take some notes (dig out that pencil and<br/>paper)."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "On your paper, I want you to write a few specific help files<br/>(I'll tell you which ones in a moment) and some notes for each one (which I<br/>shall also provide). First, though, I want to relate a personal perspective on<br/>the PennMUSH help system. Keep those pencils and paper ready, but don't write<br/>anything until and unless I instruct you to do so."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "When I was first learning MUSH code, the most frustrating<br/>aspect of the process was mastering the online help files."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "It was so frustrating, in fact, that I gave up on trying to<br/>learn it online... and I printed out hardcopies of each and every individual<br/>help file. I then arranged them according to the structured online 'help<br/>menus'. It wasn't until I had done this that I began to understand the way<br/>they were organized. Up until that point, I was /wasting/ a great deal of time<br/>hunting for a specific file."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "So, what I would like to do now is to give you the benefit of<br/>my tedious efforts without forcing you to go through the weeks and weeks of<br/>work that I did."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "That is, I'm going to tell you... in a way most of you will<br/>understand... exactly how the online help files are arranged."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "When you think of these files the way I'm about to describe<br/>them, you'll have a much better feel for how to find the file you're looking<br/>for."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "If you've been taking notes about this class so far, that's<br/>great. But, now, I want you to start with a clean sheet of paper for the<br/>things I'm about to tell you. Later on, you'll be able to refer to this piece<br/>of paper as a 'quick reference' guide for the online help. (Note: If I start<br/>some comment with 'Note:', it means 'pay attention and remember'. If I say<br/>'Write this', it means to write it down on paper.)"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Note: The PennMUSH help screens were written with the 'Telnet'<br/>(or TinyFugue) user in mind. The screens have (usually) less than 20 lines of<br/>text. (A TinyFugue screen usually has 3 lines of input at the bottom, a<br/>dividing line, and 20 or 21 lines of output at the top. This is because the<br/>old monochrome monitors had a total of 24 or 25 lines on the screen)."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Note (continued): So, all of PennMUSH's help files are fairly<br/>brief. Keep this in mind when I refer to several files together. They can be<br/>considered a group of some sort, but they are /still/ individual files (of<br/>under 20 lines)."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Now, write this at the top of your paper (yes. write this)<br/><br/>		       My PennMUSH HELP Quick Reference<br/><br/>"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Now, leave a blank line under that and then write the following<br/><br/>things..."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "(yes, write all of this.

Some of them apply only to<br/>players, others only have practical application on exits, and so on and so<br/>forth. The point is that they are _@commands_ which set _attributes_ on<br/>_objects_, and the attribute they set has the same name as the @command which<br/>sets it.<br/><br/>Example: @describe me=Tall, dark, and handsome.<br/><br/>This sets an attribute called 'describe' on 'me' containing the text 'Tall,<br/>dark, and handsome'. This may seem confusing right now, but it will eventually<br/>clear up as we move on to the other @-topics (b-d on your paper)."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Next let's look at help @-building.

Heh. Well.. I have news for you... all of the commands<br/>in the previous screen modify the database, too. But, these are more along the<br/>lines of ownership, order, and control of the database information (i.e., the<br/>object they are applied to)."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Okay... Once again, I'm going to jump out of sequence (saving<br/>the best for last. heh-heh.) The commands in 'help @-wizard' are wizard-only<br/>commands. At this point, we have no use for them.

It's important to<br/>note that all of the @commands listed in all four of these groups each has its<br/>own help file to explain its usage."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "There is one last 'list' we need to look at. Then, we can start<br/>coding. After we look this over, we will begin a small coding project. Please<br/>don't lose patience now, because it's going to get interesting in just a few<br/>minutes.

All attributes<br/>  can be addressed in get() as well as in edit, and %-substitute form,<br/>  as well as accessed via the V-function.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "The only thing we are concerned about at this time is that we<br/>can set our own attributes in the form...<br/><br/>&amp;&lt;attrib-name&gt; &lt;obj&gt;=&lt;value&gt;<br/><br/>And, note that there cannot be any spaces in an attribute name (underscores<br/>and hyphens are okay, but no spaces)."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Another shortcut for coding is to use the #dbref instead of the<br/>name (saves typing)."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "so, put an attribute on your lab project (using the<br/>non-standard format and the #dbref instead of the name)... like this...<br/><br/>&amp;test-attribute #&lt;your lab project's dbref&gt;=Woohoo!<br/>"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "You should get a response confirming that you have done this."<br/><br/>Calico's Lab Project/TEST - Set.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Something like: Lab Project/TEST_ATTRIBUTE - Set."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Okay... another help file from 'help topics'"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "USER-DEFINED COMMANDS"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "type: help user-defined commands"<br/><br/>USER-DEFINED COMMANDS<br/>  USER-DEFINED COMMANDS<br/><br/>  User-defined commands can be created by setting $comands on objects.<br/>  These are set using &amp;&lt;attrib&gt; &lt;object&gt;=$&lt;command pattern&gt;:&lt;actions&gt;. If<br/>  something a user types matches the command pattern, the actions are<br/>  executed. In order to execute a $command, you must pass the object's<br/>  uselock. Otherwise, you will get a "Permission denied." message.<br/><br/>  Any number of *'s and ?'s may be in the command pattern. A * matches<br/>  any number of characters, and a ? matches any single character.  When<br/>  the actions are executed, the values on the stack in %0-%9 are the<br/>  portions of what the user types that match the first ten *'s or ?'s.<br/>  To use a : in a command pattern, escape it with a \.<br/><br/>  For example, to make a 'wave' command, you could do the following, where<br/>  &lt;object&gt; is an object in your inventory:<br/>	&amp;do-wave &lt;object&gt;=$wave *:@force owner(me)={:waves to %0.}<br/>  You could then type:<br/>	&gt; wave Guest<br/>	Rhyanna waves to Guest.<br/><br/>  See also: STACK, SUBSTITUTIONS<br/><br/>Trispis says, "It says a bunch of stuff about stack values and substitutions<br/>and what-have-you.

Forces the game to act as though<br/>  &lt;player/object&gt; had entered &lt;command&gt;.  Only wizards may force<br/>  players. May be abbreviated @fo.  Wizards cannot be forced by<br/>  players. Hard luck. You can always force objects you control, and<br/>  will probably use this command to manipulate puppets.<br/>  An abbreviated form of this command is simply "&lt;#dbref&gt; &lt;command&gt;".<br/><br/>Trispis says, "So, What this 'user-defined attribute' has done is...
