        Topic: Introduction to MUSH<br/>Author: Noltar<br/>Summary: Noltar (@ M*U*S*H, Korongil, et al) has graciously contributed<br/>this very succinct overview of what MUSH is. If you're looking for the<br/>'about' file, this is it.<br/><br/>Section I: Introduction to MUSH<br/><br/>Many people would ask 'What is a MUSH?' when approached on this topic, so we<br/>will start there. MUSH stands for Multi-User Shared Hallucination, and is<br/>derived from the MUD family of online games. They are text based programs<br/>which allow multiple people to simultaneously interact within an artificial<br/>environment. This article will be focused on roleplaying MUSHes using the<br/>PennMUSH codebase, though the TinyMUSH and TinyMUX codebases bear enough<br/>resemblance for the knowledge contained herein to be loosely applied to them<br/>as well. In general these MUSHes focus more on character roleplaying, though<br/>building and coding are also important parts of a MUSH. Each of these topics<br/>will be discussed in their own section, though roleplaying is the focus of<br/>this article and will receive the greater attention.<br/><br/>Often the settings in which MUSHes are set include a vast amount of detail,<br/>recreating entire worlds from literature, movies, or the creators'<br/>imaginations. Many MUSHes select a literary work to base their theme upon,<br/>with Tolkien's Middle Earth, Star Wars, Star Trek, and Dragonlance being a few<br/>examples. Several other MUSH Administrators (commonly referred to as Wizards)<br/>choose to create their own worlds for their players to roleplay in. Not all<br/>MUSHes, however, restrict themselves to a specified theme, and offer character<br/>interaction in a free form environment which has its details chosen by the<br/>players, allowing them to select the situation and setting that best suits<br/>their mood and roleplaying (often referred to as RP).<br/><br/><br/>Section II: Roleplaying<br/><br/>The art of roleplaying is the lifeblood of numerous MUSHes on the Internet.<br/>Large numbers of people connect to roleplay on MUSHes of various themes every<br/>day. Many MUSHes have a range of 20 to 100 people connected simultaneously,<br/>the majority of which are looking for RP. As this is such an important part of<br/>the MUSH experience, we will detail what RP is and common definitions of how<br/>to 'properly' roleplay a MUSH character.<br/><br/>Roleplaying on a MUSH is similar to what an actor or actress does. The player<br/>attempts to assume the mentality of their character, and portray their actions<br/>within the situations which arise in the RP session. Skilled RPers are capable<br/>of capturing the essence of their alter-egos and their environment to such a<br/>degree that logs of the roleplaying read like a well written novel. While<br/>playing the role of their chosen character, the player uses only the knowledge<br/>they believe their character would possess about a given situation, ignoring<br/>Out Of Character (OOC) chatter and information. Any action taken by the RPer's<br/>character is considered In Character (IC), and is reacted to as such by the<br/>other characters taking part in the roleplaying scenario. It is considered bad<br/>form to mix OOC and IC matters while RPing. Many MUSHes provide a means of<br/>communicating in an OOC manner even while IC, with any information transmitted<br/>by such ways being totally ignored by the player's character. Often the most<br/>trying experience for a new MUSHer is learning to distinguish OOC and IC, as<br/>well as separating the 'Player' from the 'Character'.<br/><br/>There is much debate about what 'proper' RP truly is, with no definite answer<br/>apparent in most cases. However, there are many factors which are agreed upon<br/>as being required for quality roleplaying. The first has already been<br/>discussed, the separation of IC and OOC. If a player cannot keep OOC matters<br/>out of their character's IC actions they are often regarded as poor RPers and<br/>may eventually be shunned if they do not learn to distinguish between the two.<br/>The second mark of quality RP is detail. If a player's poses, the actions<br/>their character takes within the roleplaying session, involve vivid detail<br/>that make visualization and understanding of both the setting and the<br/>character's actions easily possible, then they are generally considered<br/>quality poses. One point of debate is pose length. It is held by some<br/>'authorities' on RP that lengthy, detailed, and well written poses are the<br/>pinnacle of excellent roleplaying. However, others argue that writing short,<br/>concise poses which convey the same meaning as a more lengthy pose is the best<br/>indication of a high quality RPer. It has been the experience of the author,<br/>that there are situations where lengthy detail rich poses are the best choice,<br/>while in others smaller yet still descriptive poses are wise. The final point<br/>that must be made about RP is an important one: Never pose the actions of<br/>another character. Do not include a character's reaction to the actions your<br/>character performs. Doing so will lead to arguments and on most RP oriented<br/>MUSHes disciplinary action.<br/><br/><br/>Section III: Building<br/><br/>One of the more useful skills for a MUSH player to possess, after skill at<br/>roleplaying, is Building. Each MUSH requires a large amount of building before<br/>it even opens to the public for RP. The rooms and objects which make up the<br/>world of the MUSH must all be created by its Administrators before they can<br/>welcome players onto it for roleplaying. However, a large number of MUSHes<br/>continue to grow even after opening, expanding the world which they offer.<br/>Building is accomplished by using a set of commands which enable a player to<br/>create rooms, exits, and objects as well as add descriptions and other details<br/>to them. On some MUSHes any player may build while on others it is restricted<br/>to those with the Building Power, the decision is made by the Wizards which<br/>create the MUSH. Another possible limitation on player building are quotas,<br/>where each player is allowed to own only a specified number of rooms, objects,<br/>and exits. Building can often be beyond the interest or capabilities of many<br/>MUSHers, and should generally be approached by new players only after they are<br/>familiar with the commands and procedures of the MUSH on which they play.<br/>Though not directly tied to MUSHcode it can be used to its fullest by<br/>combining the two skills.<br/><br/><br/>Section IV: MUSHCoding<br/><br/>The majority of players on a MUSH have no interest in MUSHcode, and as such it<br/>will only be briefly discussed within this article. The MUSH environment makes<br/>it possible for players to use commands and functions of the embedded<br/>programming 'language' known as MUSHcode or softcode. The complexity allowed<br/>by these tools nearly match that of the hardcode, the actual source code<br/>written in C or C++ depending on the codebase, when employed by a<br/>knowledgeable and skilled MUSHcoder. Many MUSH Wizards choose to use softcode<br/>to write the global commands which are unique to their MUSH, or which are not<br/>included within the hardcode of the codebase. Normal players may also take<br/>advantage of MUSHcode and create personal commands that make various tasks on<br/>the MUSH easier for them. Those interested in learning more about MUSHcode may<br/>read Amberyl's MUSH Manual which is available on Internet, read the Help files<br/>pertaining to commands and functions on a MUSH, or to find a skilled MUSHcoder<br/>willing to teach them. The author is planning a future article in which<br/>learning to use MUSHcode will be focused upon, with the initial steps of<br/>coding will be outlined as well as including various hints and tips for coding<br/>successfully.<br/><br/><br/>Section V: Conclusion<br/><br/>MUSHing can be an entertaining and rewarding pastime, allowing players to<br/>express their creativity and literary skills while also enjoying the company<br/>of other players in recreating a world or setting which they both have an<br/>interest. Roleplaying, building, and coding are important parts of a<br/>successful MUSH. The most important keys to quality RP are detail and<br/>distinction between IC and OOC matters. Building is used to make the world of<br/>the MUSH take on a virtual existence, while coding enables players to have<br/>access to useful commands which make interaction more enjoyable and easy.<br/><br/><br/>About the Author:<br/><br/>Noltar (Ervin Hearn III), is the Theme and Code Wizard of KorongilMUSH, as<br/>well as the creator of the original fantasy world in which it is set. He has<br/>been MUSHing for just over two and a half years and been coding/building for<br/>most of that. He has held several Administrative positions on MUSHes, MUXen,<br/>and MUDs during his short time as a MU* player and enjoys good RP and<br/>MUSHcoding. <br/><br/>He can be emailed at: noltar@korongil.org<br/><br/>He may also be found working on code or RPing as Noltar on his MUSH, <br/>Korongil, located at: mush.korongil.org Port 6250
