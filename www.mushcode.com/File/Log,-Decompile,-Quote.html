        Topic: Log, Decompile, Quote<br/>Author: Trispis, Matt, Grinna<br/>Summary: This lecture addresses the moving (porting) of objects from one MUSH to<br/>another.<br/><br/>5/3/98<br/><br/>Trispis carefully walks up the narrow stairs to the stage.<br/>Trispis has left.<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis has arrived.<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Welcome to the first lecture to be presented at our<br/>new schoolhouse on M*U*S*H."<br/><br/>Lecture Hall(#1070RanJM)<br/><br/>    /				  /^\/^\/^\				\<br/><br/>    |"""""""""""""""""""""""""|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|"""""""""""""""""""""""""|<br/><br/>    | LECTURER		      |~~)~~~~~~~~~(~~| 		  TOPIC |<br/><br/>    |			      |~~)	   (~~| 			|<br/><br/>    | Trispis		      |~~)   ___   (~~|      meeping with scoob |<br/><br/>    |			      |~~)    Y    (~~| 			|<br/><br/>    |_________________________|\___   |   ___/|_________________________|<br/><br/>      (_   (_	(_   (_   (_   \|==\_____/==|/	 _)   _)   _)	_)   _)<br/><br/>	  (_   (_   (_	 (_   (*   \|___|/   _)   _)   _)   _)	 _)<br/><br/>	      (_   (_	(_   (*   (_	 _)   _)   _)	_)   _)<br/><br/>		  (_   (_   (_	 (_   A   _)   _)   _)	 _)<br/><br/>		      (_   (_	(_   / \   _)	_)   _)<br/><br/>			  (_   (_   /	\   _)	 _)<br/><br/>			      (_   /	 \   _)<br/><br/>				  /	  \<br/>			       do: +help places<br/><br/>			  -=- Matt -=- Halatir -=-<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Before I begin, I'd like to briefly say thank you, on<br/>behalf of the MUSH 101 staff, to Javelin and Matt (and the rest of M*U*S*H)<br/>for their support in this venture."<br/><br/>Halatir cheers and claps!<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Thanks to you all."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "One other note of thanks (an a huge one, at that)<br/>goes out to scoob, our site admin on MUSH 101. Without his help, we'd never be<br/>where we are today. Thanks, mate. This lecture is dedicated to you (see the<br/>topic in the description of this room)."<br/><br/>Halatir laughs.<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Thanks, scoob, for all your support over these past<br/>several months."<br/><br/>You say, "Hurrah."<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Now... on to the lecture..."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Today's topic (despite what the sign says) is:<br/>Transporting Stuff"<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "There are only three things you need to know about<br/>this procedure...<br/><br/>1. How to log a session.<br/>2. How to use the @decompile command.<br/>3. How to quote a file."<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "All three of these tasks are fairly straightforward.<br/>And, when combined, they are very powerful as well."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "As is typical for my lectures, I'm going to take<br/>these topics out of sequence, beginning with number 2, @decompile. Later in<br/>the lecture, I'll be inviting other guest speakers to participate in the<br/>logging and quoting procedures."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "For now, though... a brief explanation of<br/>@decompile."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis recommends typing: help @decompile<br/><br/>@DECOMPILE<br/>  @decompile[&lt;/switch&gt;] &lt;object&gt;[/&lt;attribute-pattern&gt;]<br/>  @decompile/tf &lt;object&gt;/&lt;attrib&gt;<br/><br/>  This command produces a list of the commands that you would have to<br/>  enter in order to recreate &lt;object&gt;. Useful for either copying objects<br/>  from one MUSH to another, or for making logs of important objects to<br/>  protect against an accidental @nuke or a crash.<br/><br/>  You can either @decompile an entire object, or just certain parts of it.<br/>  To @decompile just a few attributes, for example, you could type:<br/><br/>      @decompile &lt;object&gt;/&lt;attribute name&gt;<br/><br/>  for each attribute. You can also use wildcards in &lt;attribute name&gt; to<br/>  @decompile a list of similarly-named attributes.<br/><br/>(continued in help @decompile2)<br/><br/>@DECOMPILE2<br/>  @decompile takes five switches: /db, /flags, /attribs, /tf, /player<br/><br/>  @decompile/db<br/>    This command makes @decompile use the object's DBREF # instead of its<br/>    name, which is useful for editing code off-MUSH.<br/>  @decompile/flags<br/>    Only the code to @create the object and set its flags is printed.<br/>  @decompile/attribs<br/>    Only the code to set the object's attributes is printed.<br/>  @decompile/player<br/>    The player's name will be printed rather than 'me', which is primarily<br/>    useful for wizards restoring a player from another db.<br/><br/>(continued in help @decompile3)<br/><br/>@DECOMPILE3<br/><br/>  @decompile/tf &lt;object&gt;/&lt;attribute&gt;<br/><br/>  The /tf switch is useful only for users of the popular "TinyFugue"<br/>  client program (available from ftp.tcp.com in the directory<br/>  /pub/muds/Clients/tinyfugue). If you do have this program, this<br/>  switch is invaluable for editing code online, because it will grab the<br/>  code to set that attribute and put it into your buffer.<br/><br/>  To use @dec/tf, first type this command into TinyFugue:<br/><br/>    /def -ag -mglob -p100 -t"FugueEdit &gt; *" fe = /grab %-2<br/><br/>  (you can also put this into your .tfrc so it will automatically<br/>  be entered every time you start TinyFugue (tf).) This command works<br/>  just like the 'FugueEdit' object originally created by van@TinyTIM.<br/><br/>See also: CLIENTS, ATTRIBUTES, WILDCARDS, MUSHCODE<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "To eliminate confusion, we're going to ignore all of<br/>the fancy switches and deal with just a basic, straightforward @decompile of a<br/>single object."<br/><br/>You say, "Yay. :)"<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Also (to eliminate even more confusion), we'll deal<br/>with a simple object. One with very few attributes."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "I recommend (for those present), using their toolkit<br/>child (the one parented to my toolkit here). It should be fairly brief in this<br/>process. Another good example (for those on MUSH 101) would be the Lab Project<br/>from previous classes."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Here's how this works..."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "This command...<br/><br/>@decompile &lt;object&gt;<br/><br/>... will spam your screen with all of the necessary commands required to<br/>rebuild that object exactly as it is at this time."<br/><br/>@create Di's Tooklit<br/>@link Di's Tooklit = #1149<br/>@parent Di's Tooklit=#1618<br/>@lock/Use Di's Tooklit=#1149<br/>@lock/Basic Di's Tooklit=#1149<br/>@set Di's Tooklit = INHERIT<br/>@VN Di's Tooklit=#128 #1623<br/>@VL Di's Tooklit=#128 #1623<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Now, you may ask, 'What good does this do me?'"<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "This is where logging and quoting come into play."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Logging is a way of 'recording' everything that is<br/>sent to your screen... onto disk (hard disk, floppy disk, zip disk, casette<br/>tape drive (for you C64 users), etc)"<br/><br/>Halatir wonders how many C64 users are present. q-)<br/><br/>Grinna shrugs.<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Quoting, is a way of taking that recorded (logged)<br/>information (a file, normally a text file) and entering it all back into your<br/>screen with a single command (or a few brief mouse clicks in some clients)."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Now, why am I discussing @decompile first?"<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Because it is the /only/ thing about this lecture<br/>that is standard for all PennMUSH users."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Logging and quoting procedures can vary from client<br/>to client."<br/><br/>You say, "Oh. :)"<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "However..."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "The order I listed them at the beginning (Log,<br/>@decompile, quote) is the order these things are actually performed."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "that is..."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "You begin logging..."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "You give the command: @decompile &lt;object&gt; ..."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "(then, when it's done, you stop logging)"<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Then, you quote the logged file back into the MUSH<br/>where you're moving it to."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "A few notes about this procedure before we address<br/>the subtle differences in logging/quoting procedures for various clients..."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "first note..."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "@decompile will record the #dbrefs written into the<br/>database and into softcoded attributes /exactly/ as they are for this object."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Example: The toolkit child will record #1618 as its<br/>parent and will record a command<br/><br/>@parent toolkit=#1618<br/><br/>which is the parent object here on M*U*S*H."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "The point here is: you may need to edit the log for<br/>specific #dbref entries contained in some of the commands (parents, home,<br/>ufun()'s, etc.)"<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "... before you quote it back in."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Note number two..."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis shuffles his papers, looking for his notes.<br/><br/>Grinna giggles.<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis repeats himself as he finds his notes, "Note number two..."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "it is advisable to take a few precautions before<br/>beginning a log/decompile session."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "These precautions include the following...<br/><br/>Find a quiet/private location to do this.<br/>Remove yourself from (or gag) all chat channels<br/>(In extreme cases) @set yourself HAVEN<br/><br/>These precautions will help assure you a clean, interruption-free log."<br/><br/>Octavian has arrived.<br/><br/>Grinna waves and bids you have a seat. :)<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Now, on to logging (and eventually, quoting)..."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Logging, as I stated earlier, is a way of recording<br/>all of the information sent to your screen from the MUSH ... in this case, the<br/>@decompile information of an object (i.e., all of the commands required to<br/>rebuild it exactly as it is)."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "When logging, you'll need to remember two very<br/>important things..."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "One: You will need to give your logfile a name (just<br/>like any other file from a word processor or whatever, it needs a name)."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Two: You will need to save the file in a location<br/>where you will be able to find it (i.e., don't accept MS Windows default<br/>unless you're sure that's where you'll go looking for it later). Be specific<br/>about these things."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Oh, yeah... and three (sorry, there were three<br/>things): Logging (in almost every circumstance) creates a standard *.txt file<br/>(e.g., thislog.txt).... or at least it saves it in a that format (although the<br/>extension may not be .txt). ... That is, the file itself is a standard ascii<br/>text file (regardless of the filename and extension)."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Okay. That brings us to the specifics of /how to<br/>log/."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "In some cases, logging is done by 'menu clicks' or<br/>'hot buttons' (SimpleMU, for instance, has both of these options). In other<br/>cases, it is done via typed commands with specific syntax (TinyFugue, for<br/>example, uses this method)."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "I have invited a couple guest speakers to speak about<br/>these two particular clients (SimpleMU, and TinyFugue), because they seem to<br/>be representative of these general /styles/ of usage (in fact, SimpleMU even<br/>allows the typed command version, which is nearly identical to that of<br/>TinyFugue)."<br/><br/>You say, "You go first Matt. :)"<br/><br/>Matt says, "Gee, thanks ;)"<br/><br/>You say, "You're welcome. :)"<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "So, without further delay, let me introduce Grinna<br/>... who will be speaking on the SimpleMU logging process."<br/><br/>You say, "Oh shoot. :)"<br/><br/>Matt keels over laughing.<br/><br/>You stand and leave the West Front Row.<br/><br/>You climb the stage. Your feel your heart bouncing in your chest.<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Grinna comes walking up to you.<br/><br/>&lt;Audience&gt; Halatir claps!<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Grinna says, "Okay.."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Grinna says, "For SimpleMU.. As Trispis pointed out there are 3 ways<br/>of starting a log."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Grinna says, "One way.. (the easiest) is to use the Log Icon at the<br/>top of the SimpleMU screen."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Grinna says, "Another is to pull down the Connection Menu and Click<br/>on Start Logging"<br/>Lecturer&gt; Grinna says, "Or Use the Keys Ctrl+L"<br/>Lecturer&gt; Grinna says, "You may also type /log in the 'send' window."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Grinna says, "Any of these will result in SimpleMU popping up a<br/>screen where you may choose 1. Where you want to save your log and 2. What you<br/>want to call said Log."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Grinna says, "After which you will get questioned... as to whether<br/>or not you want to use word wrap."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Grinna says, "And then if you want to log back to the buffer (very<br/>helpful if you started logging a bit late)."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Grinna says, "In either of the last two cases you simply click the<br/>Yes or No buttons."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Grinna says, "THen you will get a line that says Logging has<br/>started."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Grinna says, "To stop logging You may either click the 'Log' Icon<br/>again, or pull down the Connection Menu to Stop Logging, or type ctrl+L."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Grinna says, "And just for the record.. I prefer to log to disc.<br/>That way I never have to go looking thru the computer files for it."<br/>Grinna sits back down now. :)<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Thank you, Grinna. (:"<br/><br/>You feel a great relief as the lecture ends.<br/><br/>You take a seat in the West Front Row.<br/><br/>Grinna wipes the sweat from her brow.<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Please give Grinna a big round of applause."<br/><br/>Matt claps!<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis claps!<br/><br/>Grinna blushes furiously.<br/><br/>Halatir claps again! :)<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Now, Matt will give us the instructions for the same<br/>process in the TinyFugue client."<br/><br/>Matt carefully walks up the narrow stairs to the stage.<br/>Lecturer&gt; Matt has arrived.<br/><br/>Grinna applauds. :)<br/><br/>Halatir too. :)<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Matt says, "Logging in TinyFugue is controlled entirely through one<br/>command (typed as normal): /log (the full and gory details are available via<br/>/help log)."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Matt says, "Typing /log with no arguments will tell you if you are<br/>currently logging or not. And if you use TF in 'visual' mode (with a separate<br/>area for typing in - this is the default in newer versions), you will see<br/>'(Log)' on the righthand side of your screen, while logging."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Matt says, "You can enable logging with '/log on', but, will want to<br/>seriously consider one or two of the options. For instance '/log -w' allows<br/>you to log a specific world (put the world name right after the -w, for<br/>instance -wmush if you named this world 'mush'), or the current world, if no<br/>name is given."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Matt says, "Issuing /log -g will log *all* your worlds to the same<br/>file."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Matt says, "Finally (and most usefully!) you can control the name of<br/>the file to which TF logs, by simply putting a filename at the end of the<br/>command, for instance: /log -wmush mush.log. The default filename is<br/>'tiny.log'."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Matt says, "A point worth adding, with reference to filenames for<br/>logs - TF should happily tolerate any path you want to add, if you make it<br/>part of the filename, for instance: /log -wmush ~/logs/sunday.log (note the<br/>UNIX path format; I've not used the TF port for Windows95, but would expect it<br/>to behave in a similar fashion)."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Matt says, "To stop logging you simply need to enter: /log off."<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Thank you, Matt. (:"<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Let's give Matt a big round of applause. (:"<br/><br/>Matt comes down from the stage and stumbles over the microphone's flex in the<br/>process.<br/><br/>Grinna claps loudly. :)<br/><br/>Matt giggles.<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Okay. That covers logging and decompiling. Before<br/>going on to quoting, I'd like to review what we've covered so far."<br/><br/>Halatir ouches, but claps anyway. :)<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "The process (as stated before) is...<br/><br/>Start logging<br/>@decompile &lt;object&gt;<br/>stop logging<br/><br/>^^ we've covered all of this ^^<br/><br/>then, quote the log back in to the new MUSH. (haven't covered this, yet)."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Grinna asked me to address quoting in SimpleMU, so I<br/>will... very briefly (as I've only used it once, but found it to be very<br/>feature-full and useful)."<br/><br/>Raven emerges from the South.<br/>Raven has arrived.<br/><br/>Grinna waves. :)<br/><br/>Raven waves.<br/><br/>Halatir waves too. :)<br/><br/>You say, "Have a seat, Raven."<br/><br/>Raven takes a seat in the West Front Row.<br/>Raven joins you.<br/><br/>Halatir stands and leaves the West Second Row.<br/>Halatir takes a seat in the West Front Row.<br/>Halatir joins you.<br/><br/>In your row, Grinna giggles at Hal. :)<br/><br/>Halatir is filling up the places. q-)<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Quoting in SimpleMU (not sure of all the other<br/>optional methods) can be done by selecting the Connections pulldown menu, then<br/>selecting 'Upload Text'."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "This will bring up a window which allows you to<br/>select the file you wish to uplaod (i.e., the one you logged before)."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "It also allows you to select a few other options on<br/>how it performs the upload (quote)."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "I won't go into the details on all of these, however<br/>I will mention one noteworthy feature..."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "SimpleMU allows you to specify a 'delay' time between<br/>each line it sends to the game."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "for small files (like the Lab Project), this can be<br/>ignored."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Larger files, however (like the figlet I ported for<br/>our entrance description), can cause a tremendous amount of lag on your<br/>connection. Thus, this 'delay' time can keep your connection from becoming<br/>overly lagged."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "If all you want to do is to be able to chat or do a<br/>bit of mild RP while you upload, a delay time of 1 second should be<br/>sufficient. (If you're some kind of psycho-coder-rper-admin-helper-type and<br/>you're terribly active, you might want to specify a delay of 2 or 3 seconds.<br/>Note: the more delay, the longer it will take to upload the file.)"<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Once you've specified a file to upload (and any other<br/>options you want to add, like the delay time), you just click 'okay' ... and<br/>away she goes (in the bottom of the screen, it will tell you you're uploading<br/>until it is finished)."<br/><br/>You say, "Question?"<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Yes, Grinna?"<br/><br/>You say, "When you are quoting back say.. a bunch of rooms and exits... do you<br/>just let it run? Or do you have to hit the enter key at any time?"<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Well. Quoting in rooms should be done on a<br/>room-by-room basis. I don't know if the PennMUSH @decompile command will<br/>record the commands necessary for you to move about for the rebuilding<br/>process. I suggest @decompiling each room to a separate file... and if they're<br/>not very complex, it's almost easier to examine/copy/paste. (In fact, I<br/>recommend this for almost everything: a separate file for each thing)."<br/><br/>You say, "Ah.. okay."<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis will research this question (which was a very good question,<br/>btw) and add any insight to the log.<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Matt will now give us the lowdown on quoting with<br/>TinyFugue."<br/><br/>Matt carefully walks up the narrow stairs to the stage.<br/><br/>You say, "Yay. :)"<br/><br/>Raven chuckles.<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Matt says, "As with /log, you can get to the help on /quote via<br/>/help quote, but, even more so than for /log, it's really very convoluted. The<br/>command itself is quite simple, but has one quirk which might catch you out.<br/><br/>/quote file  &lt;--- this won't actually work<br/><br/>the required syntax is<br/><br/>/quote 'file  &lt;--- note the single quote mark<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Matt says, "However, there are (as before) some very useful switches<br/>which can be added to the command. Firstly, -w which behaves the same as /log<br/>-w, allowing you to limit your upload to a single specified world (eg: /quote<br/>-wmush 'file), or to the current world."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Matt says, "TF also allows you to specify a delay between uploading<br/>lines, just as SimpleMU does. Trispis has already explained the primary<br/>benefits of this, and all which really needs to be added is the format. Adding<br/>"-X" where X is a number (eg: /quote -2 'file) will put a pause of X sections<br/>between lines."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Matt says, "Not terribly useful for combination with @decompile, but<br/>handy to know, is that TF can also add a 'prefix' to each line sent, allowing<br/>you to 'funnel' input through other commands, for instance:<br/><br/>/quote -wmush -1 say  'file<br/><br/>would put "say " before each line with a one second delay between each,<br/>allowing you to 'speak' from a preprepared textfile."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Matt says, "The file argument for /quote should work quite happily<br/>with paths such as "/quote -wmush '~/logs/file.log", in the same manner as<br/>/log does."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Matt says, "TF shouldn't object if you omit arguments (eg: /quote -2<br/>'file), but may get a little rowdy if you put them in the wrong<br/>order (eg: /quote -2 -wmush 'file). Keep them in the order:<br/><br/>world, delay, filename.<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis moves the flex out of the way.<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Matt departs, carefully this time.<br/>Matt comes down the few steps from the stage.<br/>Matt has arrived.<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Okay. One more summary..."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "The process for moving an object from one MUSH to<br/>another (usually only useful for larger things with lots of attributes... and<br/>yes, you can @decompile your characater (PLAYER) for taking fancy @otports<br/>@oxtports @omoves and the like) is as follows:<br/><br/>start logging (using your favorite client's log features)<br/>@decompile &lt;object&gt;<br/>stop logging<br/>go to the new MUSH and quote (upload) the log<br/><br/>It's all very simple, once you get the hang of it. And is invaluable for<br/>larger items (My toolkit is four objects with about 50 attributes per object.<br/>I'd be miserable without these procedures)."<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Any questions before I dismiss?"<br/><br/>Grinna thinks she's got it. :) Quotes are cool. :)<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "Okay... Since there don't seem to be any questions,<br/>let's give one more big round of applause to Grinna and Matt for their<br/>participation in this lecture. Thanks, you two. (:"<br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis claps.<br/><br/>Halatir claps loudly!<br/><br/>Raven applauds!<br/><br/>Grinna blushes again. :)<br/><br/>Halatir says, "And for Trispis!"<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis says, "I'll get this log edited and uploaded ASAP."<br/><br/>Grinna applauds Trispis. :) :)<br/><br/>Lecturer&gt; Trispis bows politely.
