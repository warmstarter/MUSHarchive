        Amberyl's Wizard Lecture<br/><br/>This is an expansion of the section of the MUSH manual called <br/>"The Fundamental Laws of Wizarding".   Questions and comments<br/>should go to lwl@digex.net. The content of the lecture has been<br/>unmodified since 10/23/94.<br/><br/><br/>Administrators on a MUSH have a considerable amount of power. With that<br/>power comes the responsibility to use it wisely, for the actions of<br/>an administrator reflect not only on himself, but on the MUSH as a whole.<br/>Because an admin is in a position of power, he should attempt to set a<br/>positive example in all dealings, whether in-character or out-of-character,<br/>Common sense will usually suggest a decent solution to a given problem;<br/>there are, however, some situations where the ethical and "correct" thing<br/>to do is not immediately obvious.<br/><br/><br/>Players are frequently paranoid about privacy. This is one "right" that<br/>you should _always_ attempt to respect; thus, this lecture begins with<br/>a discussion of the DARK flag. When you are DARK in a room, players who<br/>do a 'look' cannot see you, and you do not appear on the WHO list, but<br/>a @sweep of the room _does_ show that you are listening and connected.<br/>Therefore, there is a chance that you will be noticed, and, if you are<br/>"illegally" in the room DARK, it is almost certain that the players in<br/>the room will be quite upset.<br/><br/>The reason why players don't like DARK wizards wandering around should<br/>be obvious -- they're afraid of private conversations being snooped on.<br/>Therefore, whenever you go _anyplace_ DARK, the first thing you should<br/>type upon entering the room is a "hello" or similar announcement of your<br/>presence. Make this a habit! If you do it regularly, even when the players<br/>in the room know you'll be entering DARK, there's less of a chance you<br/>will forget at some crucial moment. If you plan to be DARK, and wandering<br/>around, for an extended period of time, in order to arbitrate an RPG<br/>conflict or similar event, the players involved should, if possible,<br/>know of your presence, and if a private conversation begins, it is your<br/>ethical responsibility to inform the players of your presence immediately,<br/>_even if_ this lets players know that they are being judged. Your personal<br/>responsibility to promote privacy overrides any RPG mechanics.<br/><br/>Some MUSH gods may allow their wizards to go DARK in order to observe<br/>players whom are suspected of trying to harm the game, either by harming<br/>the database or crashing the server; some other gods may also allow<br/>wizards to go DARK to observe the actions of a player harassing other<br/>players. In the latter case, the wizard should indicate his presence to<br/>the players in the room who are not "under suspicion".<br/><br/>I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to obey the protocols<br/>for using the DARK flag. This is one of the greatest sources of <br/>player distrust in wizards, because it is so _easy_ to abuse. Players<br/>should be able to have private conversations without doing a @sweep<br/>all the time. While privacy on a MUD is never, ever, guaranteed, you<br/>should do your best to contribute towards it.<br/><br/><br/>The second of the frequently-abused wizard powers is @teleport. There<br/>are a number of rules that should be observed when @teleporting. First<br/>of all, never teleport a player without warning him first. If possible,<br/>the player should page you with an acknowledgement before you do the<br/>actual @tel. This prevents, for example, an untimely @teleport wrecking<br/>someone's set of a @desc on a room. No one enjoys suddenly being yanked<br/>to another room, and it doesn't hurt you to page the player first.<br/><br/>Never teleport to a room with players without asking the permission of<br/>the players there first. The exception to this are public hangouts. <br/>A room which is merely JUMP_OK is not necessarily a public hangout; use<br/>some judgement when determining whether or not rooms are public. Unless<br/>the room is clearly public, ask first; it doesn't hurt you to be polite.<br/><br/>If permission is not likely to be granted, then notify all players in<br/>the room (@remit works well for this) that you are going to be coming<br/>in, before entering the room. You should wait a moment between the of<br/>the announcement and the teleport; this should prevent you from hearing<br/>something that you shouldn't.<br/><br/>Never make assumptions about whether or not it's okay to teleport into<br/>a situation. For example, just because a player is paging you for help<br/>with coding some complex object _doesn't_ mean that he wants you to<br/>teleport into his room and help him out. I know this from experience --<br/>as a new wizard, I once struggled to help someone, remotely, with a<br/>complex MUSHcoded object, and, finally, after fifteen minutes of<br/>fruitless pages, I finally decided to teleport in and see what errors<br/>the object was outputting. Unfortunately, I bamf'ed myself straight<br/>into the middle of a hot 'n steamy tinysex session. Since then, I've<br/>made it a rule to _always_ ask before teleporting.<br/><br/><br/>Don't abuse "examine" or the power to see private information like sites.<br/>The rules for examining private objects will vary from God to God. On a<br/>MUSH where a strict theme is enforced, wizards will probably be permitted<br/>to examine anything in order to check for theme consistency. You should<br/>never share or show any object, or part of an object, that is not yours<br/>to another player, without getting the permission of the owner. Also,<br/>don't steal code. "Stealing code" includes @decompiling/logging/cloning<br/>without permission, even if you're just using the code for your own<br/>personal edification or enjoyment. If it's that important to you, ask<br/>permission.<br/><br/>Sitenames should never be given out. If a player is Unfindable, you<br/>shouldn't give out his location. Some people MUD to escape people they<br/>know in Real Life; some players carry vendettas cross-MUD. Other people<br/>simply prefer not to let others know where they are, VR or RL. You<br/>should respect this desire.<br/><br/><br/>You should generally avoid modifying other people's objects, even if<br/>you're fixing code problems or typos. The only exception to this is<br/>publicly owned building owned by a wizard-played builder character<br/>(the core landscape for the MUSH, the downtown area, etc.)  If you<br/>encounter an object which is inefficiently programmed or looping,<br/>and thus slowing down the game for everyone else, simply set it HALT<br/>and mail the owner; don't fix the problem.<br/><br/>Also, don't @destroy anything of anyone else's unless they explicitly<br/>ask you to. If it's an item which is illegal in some way, send the<br/>owner a warning, and give him a certain period of time (a few days,<br/>usually, depending on how often the player logs in) in which to get<br/>rid of it. If it's not gone by the end of the period, then you can<br/>destruct it. If the illegal item is sitting in a public place, you<br/>should feel free to teleport it back to its owner.<br/><br/><br/>Never, ever, @force a player, unless it is _absolutely_ necessary.<br/>For the same reasons, don't use @trigger and similar commands to make<br/>a player do something against his will. Also, don't change the attributes<br/>on a player; for example, it is generally considered unethical to change<br/>a player's description to something humiliating. Wizards might occassional<br/>get into practical joke wars, but mortals shouldn't become involved.<br/>If you need to change an attribute on a player, make sure you copy the<br/>old attribute to a backup attribute on the player, so that they can<br/>recover it later, if need be.<br/><br/><br/>Wizards can pile huge numbers of things on the queue, and make use of<br/>computationally expensive commands like @find and @search with impunity.<br/>If you need to do something that will severely lag the game, do it when<br/>there aren't many players on. Also, note that very large @dolists cause<br/>the MUSH process size to grow, and should be avoided whenever possible.<br/><br/><br/>Wizards should be uselocked at all times. Private wiztoys should also<br/>be uselocked. Any item with wizard powers MUST be checked for security;<br/>if you are not a competent enough MUSH programmer to be able to do this<br/>yourself, you should show the item to a wizard who is. In addition,<br/>administrators and objects owned by administrators should never be zoned<br/>to a Zone to which mortals have access. <br/><br/>Never give a wiz-power item to a mortal. If a mortal absolutely MUST have<br/>a wizard-power item to do what he wants, consider @chown'ing that particular<br/>system to a wizard. If this isn't possible, then make absolutely certain<br/>that the mortal is trustworthy. Every administrator on the game should be<br/>aware of all wiz-power items in the hands of mortals.<br/><br/><br/>Avoid annoying players with shouts. @wall cannot be blocked, and, therefore,<br/>you should make sure that everything you shout is informative and necessary.<br/>On a very small, friendly MUSH, it might be considered acceptable to @wall<br/>hello and goodbye; on most MUSHes, though, especially RPG ones where "mood"<br/>and "atmosphere" are important, @walls of that sort should be avoided.<br/>Shouting to announce a @shutdown in five minutes is acceptable; shouting<br/>to announce game problems is acceptable. Shouting to announce that you've<br/>had a bad day and shouldn't be paged should probably be avoided. First of<br/>all, it makes you sound like a twit; second, it accomplishes nothing useful<br/>and implies, "stay out of my way or something bad will happen to you."<br/>If you really want to avoid player pages, go DARK and set a pagelock.<br/>Players shouldn't be afraid of you on a "professional" wizard level, and<br/>you should try to avoid actions which cause players to fear you.<br/><br/><br/>Wizards should be thoroughly familiar with MUSH. While "psychocoder" status<br/>is not necessary, a good understanding of MUSH mechanics is necessary. Never<br/>type a command as a wizard without understanding what it does. You should<br/>have read the MUSH manual; even if you don't understand all of it, you should<br/>read and understand the wizard section.<br/><br/>Every object in the Master Room should have a specific purpose. ONLY<br/>objects used for global commands should be in the Master Room. As few<br/>total attributes should be on Master Room objects as possible; any<br/>data objects should be contained on separate objects NOT in the master<br/>room, and the Master Room objects should NOT be parented to the data<br/>objects. Every attribute in the Master Room represents another attribute<br/>that must be checked for $commands when a player types something; thus,<br/>having unnecessary objects and attributes in the room will slow the<br/>game down. If you need a place to store objects used as global parents<br/>and whatnot, use a room _other_ than the Master Room. Master Room code<br/>should, obviously, be as efficient as possible.<br/><br/><br/>There should be at least one wizard on the game who is familiar with the<br/>technical aspects of the server. Also, backups should be done on a weekly<br/>basis, or more often, if possible. This will save you a lot of grief should<br/>your database get eaten by a bug or other problem. If your currently-running<br/>game begins to show signs of database corruption, it is probably a good idea<br/>NOT to @shutdown; instead, log into the game account and 'kill -9' the MUSH<br/>process. It's also a good idea for wizards to know the phone number of the<br/>God / codehack / site admin, for emergencies.<br/><br/>If you have the necessary technical background, you are highly encourage<br/>to at least take a glance at the server code. Knowledge of the server<br/>workings helps your MUSH programming ability, and enables you to make<br/>intelligent decisions that involve disk, memory, and CPU usage. Also,<br/>get to know wizards on other MUSHes; this gives you people to go to for<br/>help should something unfortunate befall your MUSH.<br/><br/><br/>Never MUSH while intoxicated or otherwise not fully in control of your<br/>actions. If you observe another wizard who is MUSHing drunk, @boot them.<br/>The other wizard will probably be annoyed, but this is better than having<br/>damage inadvertently caused by someone who isn't thinking clearly.<br/><br/>Know when to log off or back out of a situation. If you feel like you're<br/>about to explode, get up, walk around for a bit, get a drink of water,<br/>and come back when you feel like you're ready to cope rationally with<br/>the situation. If possible, call in another administrator to handle the<br/>situation. Never, ever, perform wizard actions out of anger; it is likely<br/>that you will regret them later.<br/><br/><br/>A wizard's ability to deal with players is usually the final test of his<br/>skills. Troublemaking players are quick to find wizards who are easily<br/>provoked, and frequently enjoy pushing all the buttons they can. When you<br/>page a player, no matter how annoyed you might be, you should try to<br/>remain calm and polite. Don't swear at players, or behave in a manner<br/>that would allow the player to focus a discussion away from his wrongdoing<br/>to a mistake _you_ made.<br/><br/>Players who are spamming or exhibiting behavior detrimental to the server<br/>or database should be @booted; if it's a one-time-deal character like<br/>"You_Suck", a @destroy is also in order. Other players should receive<br/>warnings before any direct action is taken.<br/><br/>If a player is being obnoxious or breaking MUSH rules, page them and politely<br/>let them know that their behavior is unacceptable. If the player is not idle,<br/>and does not respond to your page within a few minutes, repeat your page. If<br/>the player simply ignores you, or refuses to change his behavior, page with<br/>a stronger warning, but continue to remain polite. If this doesn't work,<br/>tell them, "If you don't stop that, I'm going to @boot you."<br/><br/>This will normally at least open a dialogue between yourself and the player<br/>in question. If the player isn't willing to discuss it, and continues the<br/>obnoxious behavior, set them GAG. Most players will quit voluntarily. For<br/>really stubborn players, @boot will work. If they come back and continue to<br/>be annoying, then @newpassword them. You should NOT @destroy a player who<br/>isn't a one-shot annoyance. @destroy is not reversible, but a player can<br/>be re-@newpassworded should he decide to come back and play by the rules.<br/><br/>When talking to a player, you should attempt to remain calm and polite,<br/>no matter how much the player is trying to provoke you. Ignore personal<br/>insults, obscenities, and the like, if some useful discussion is occurring.<br/>If the player is just continuing to be annoying, end the discussion and<br/>simply tell them, "Do this again and I'll @boot you."  You're not required<br/>to be a saint or martyr.<br/><br/>Whenever you enter a major conflict with a player, you should log the<br/>situation, if possible. You should send the other wizards, via email,<br/>a summary of the situation, and, if necessary, the log. This will prevent<br/>the player from accusing you of saying or doing things that you did not,<br/>and will give you a "record" of the player's behavior, in case the player<br/>claims that he didn't do what you claimed he did. The SUSPECT flag and<br/>@comment attribute are also good for letting other wizards know about<br/>suspicious players.<br/><br/><br/>These guidelines aren't here to make the task of wizarding more difficult<br/>for you. They exist to provide some basic guidelines of ethical behavior;<br/>in general, if you follow these guidelines, players will find it quite<br/>difficult to accuse you of abusing your wizpowers. They thus work for<br/>_your_ protection, as well as the players'.  Players frequently take<br/>wizard mistakes personally and seriously, and may decide, "because<br/>wizard X did this, all other wizards probably do, too."  Players who are<br/>paranoid tend to be more difficult to deal with; thus, for the sake of<br/>your sanity and that of every other wizard who ever has to deal with<br/>that player, try to avoid giving the a reason to be paranoid.  If you<br/>consistently have personal problems with a player, you should also avoid<br/>wizard dealings with that player; have another wizard handle the situation<br/>instead.<br/><br/>In all things, use common sense, and try to remain calm and impartial.<br/>When all else fails, log off.<br/><br/><br/>[ Based on a lecture first given on TinyKrynn, 2/92, by Amberyl. ]<br/>
