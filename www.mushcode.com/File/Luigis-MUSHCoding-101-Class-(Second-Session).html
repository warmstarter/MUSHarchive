Most of<br/>it has been left in its original state, though some parts of the log were<br/>edited to remove spam or correct a speaker's typo. A '*' has been placed in<br/>front of the speaker's name.<br/><br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>(Faizah, Rhayden, and Kronus pay class fees.)<br/>* Luigi says, "Thank you for coming."<br/>Wayne has arrived.<br/>Link has arrived.<br/>Kronus says, "My payment"<br/>* Luigi says, "Thank you."<br/>Kronus says, "I'll be back quick as I can..."<br/>* Luigi says, "Last week we talked about the Fundamentals of MUSHCoding."<br/>Laci has arrived.<br/>Illmuri has arrived.<br/>* Luigi says, "We talked about Commands, and Functions."<br/>* Luigi says, "Commands as you remember, are things such as 'say', 'pose', and<br/>'@emit'."<br/>Illmuri switches clients<br/>Illmuri has disconnected.<br/>Illmuri has connected.<br/>* Luigi says, "Functions look like this, functionName(), and have a variety of uses<br/>depending on which function they are. If you completed your homework you used add(),<br/>sub(), div(), and mul(), and perhaps one or more others."<br/>* Luigi says, "Lastly, we talked about user defined commands, or $-commands. We made<br/>our own commands, and your calculators had their own commands on them."<br/>* Luigi says, "Any questions or troubles you had with homework, before we begin on<br/>today's lesson?"<br/>Faizah shakes head.<br/>Laci says, "does not doing it count?"<br/>Illmuri says, "neg"<br/>Rhayden raises his hand. "You got my homework, yes?"<br/>* Luigi nods.<br/>Rhayden says, "Nifty."<br/>Link says, "My polour bear ate it."<br/>Rhayden pokes Link and chuckles.<br/>* Luigi says, "Alright, let's dive right in. First we'll just talk about a few more<br/>basic commands you should be familiar with."<br/>* Luigi says, "First off, you remember we set attributes like so:<br/>&amp;&lt;attribute name&gt; &lt;object&gt;=&lt;what the attribute contains&gt;"<br/>* Luigi says, "You should be aware that if you ever wish to remove an attribute, you<br/>can type: &amp;&lt;attribute name&gt; &lt;object&gt;"<br/>Laci says, "Can you give us an example?"<br/>* Luigi says, "Sure"<br/>* Luigi says, "Everybody type this:"<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; &amp;zorg me=hi<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; ex me/zorg<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; &amp;zorg me<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; ex me/zorg<br/>* Luigi says, "Understand?"<br/>Laci says, "yup"<br/>Rhayden nods.<br/>* Luigi says, "There is also a @wipe command, which does the same thing, and can be<br/>used like this: @wipe &lt;object&gt;/&lt;attribute&gt;"<br/>Faizah nods.<br/>* Luigi says, "Which you use is up to you."<br/>Rhayden has had problems with @wipe before.<br/>* Luigi says, "Next, do you all remember @create?"<br/>Faizah nods.<br/>* Luigi says, "It creates an object, like the calculator in the homework."<br/>Rhayden nods again.<br/>Laci nods<br/>* Luigi says, "Well, if you ever wish to get rid of such a creation. @destroy &lt;object<br/>name&gt;"<br/>* Luigi says, "If you feel like @creating something and then @destroying it, feel<br/>free."<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; @create zorg zorg<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; @destroy zorg zorg<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; @destroy zorg zorg<br/>Rhayden says, "How to you spare an object from destruction?"<br/>Illmuri says, "twice to instantly remove it, once will take 10 minutes"<br/>Illmuri says, "incase you want to keep it"<br/>* Luigi nods to Illmuri.<br/>Rhayden says, "*do"<br/>* Luigi says, "Well, if you type @destroy once, and then change your mind, you can<br/>@undestroy &lt;object&gt;."<br/>* Luigi says, "It's probably smarted to do it once and wait, but I always do it twice<br/>because I want results now. :)"<br/>Faizah says, "Ah! I wondered why @destroy/instant didn't work."<br/>Link says, "Once I had an object, but then it was @nuked."<br/>* Luigi says, "Now I want to introduce a couple of new functions."<br/>Rhayden says, "Does @undestroy work here?"<br/>* Luigi says, "Yep."<br/>Rhayden recalls having to use something else.<br/>* Luigi says, "On some MU*s you have to do: @set &lt;object&gt;=!going, but that's not here.<br/>I think maybe MUX does it like that."<br/>* Luigi says, "The first function we shall discuss is rand()."<br/>* Luigi says, "This is a fun little function which returns a random number."<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say rand(15)<br/>* Luigi says, "12"<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say rand(15)<br/>* Luigi says, "3"<br/>Rhayden says, "400"<br/>* Luigi says, "The number it returns is from 0 to the number given it minus one."<br/>Laci says, "#-1 ARGUMENT MUST BE INTEGER"<br/>Faizah says, "7"<br/>Faizah says, "1"<br/>Faizah says, "4"<br/>* Luigi says, "If you'll remember our discussion on square braces last week.."<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say [rand(50)] [rand(50)] [rand(50)] [rand(50)] [rand(50)]<br/>* Luigi says, "13 15 19 45 8"<br/>Laci says, "there should be something that lets you say "pigscanfly""<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say [rand(50)] [rand(50)] [rand(50)] [rand(50)] [rand(50)]<br/>* Luigi says, "37 29 44 35 13"<br/>Faizah says, "39 4 26 18 26"<br/>Faizah says, "8 2 18 15 7"<br/>Rhayden says, "2 5 45 8 38"<br/>Laci says, "26 #-1 FUNCTION () NOT FOUND"<br/>Laci says, "oops."<br/>* Luigi says, "Next we have get()."<br/>Laci says, "you could use that to create die, right?"<br/>* Luigi nods to Laci.<br/>* Luigi says, "Or, the DIE() function. :)"<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say die(1,6)<br/>* Luigi says, "3"<br/>Rhayden says, "Except there's already a lovely... yeah, what Luigi said."<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say die(1,6)<br/>* Luigi says, "4"<br/>* Luigi says, "Get() allows you to get an attribute from something and use it in code."<br/>* Luigi says, "Try this:"<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; &amp;corndogs me=i like corn dogs<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; say [get(me/corndogs)]<br/>* Luigi says, "i like corn dogs"<br/>Faizah says, "i like corn dogs"<br/>Laci says, "i like corn dogs"<br/>Rhayden says, "I like corn doggies"<br/>* Luigi says, "In code, you could set an attribute to something via a $-command, and<br/>later get() its contents."<br/>Laci says, "are $-commands like my parrots?"<br/>Faizah says, "Hmm..."<br/>* Luigi says, "$-commands are the things we did last week, which look like this:"<br/>* Luigi types --&gt; &amp;&lt;attribute&gt; &lt;object&gt;=$&lt;command&gt;:&lt;code to run when someone types<br/>the command&gt;<br/>Ale Maid has arrived.<br/>* Luigi says, "Do you remember?"<br/>Laci says, "yup, that's my parrot!"<br/>Laci says, "g2g"<br/>* Luigi says, "Get() and Rand() come in handy with one of the most useful @commands<br/>ever: @switch."<br/>Laci goes home.<br/>Laci has left.<br/>Ale Maid has left.<br/>Faizah takes Ale Maid.<br/>* Luigi says, "@Switch, if you know any other programming languages, is like the<br/>SELECT CASE in VB/Qbasic/C++/Java...

In my opinion."<br/>Rhayden says, "I guess that's up to coding style."<br/>* Luigi says, "It's easy to make mistakes.

Or, you may look up Switch() and<br/>put that directly into the @description."<br/>Faizah says, "Always the perfectionist."<br/>* Luigi says, "You may use ANSI/FANSI in the description for extra credit.

Extra credit in an area I'm great at. ;)"<br/>* Luigi says, "But you don't need ANSI. Just a house plant that changes description<br/>implying it has grown, when you water it."<br/>* Luigi says, "Thank you very much for showing up. Next week we can continue our<br/>studies. You know quite a bit more than the average MUSHer now, believe it or not.<br/>@Switch is very useful."<br/>Faizah nodnods. I think I know more about coding than I did when I first attempted it.<br/>Heh.<br/>Kronus bows...<br/>* Luigi says, "Thank you, and please give me 1 coin if you haven't already. :)"<br/>Kronus says, "Thanks teacher"<br/>Kronus already did...<br/>* Luigi goes to find HIkenin to do the raffle, talk to you guys later, gotta go soon.<br/>* Luigi will grade your homework by next class..<br/>Faizah says, "I prefer switch() but that's me. Are there any differences between<br/>switch() and @switrch?"<br/>Rhayden says, "Yep"<br/>Rhayden says, "You can't use @switch inside a function."<br/>Rhayden says, "For a (bad) example... [ansi(@switch blah)] wouldn't work"<br/>Rhayden says, "You would use [ansi([switch()])] instead."<br/>Faizah heh. There's a few reasons that wouldn't work.<br/>Rhayden nods.<br/>Rhayden says, "But you get my point?"<br/>Faizah nods.<br/>Rhayden says, "Nifty. :)"<br/>
