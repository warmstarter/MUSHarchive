It is almost three stories in hight, though mostly underground, and a<br/>city block in length and width. The factory that the building once was has<br/>been stripped and rebuilt, though the feeling of it's origins seem firmly<br/>rooted and relected upon by the designer's industrial style. Sprawling<br/>catwalks of carefully tarnished steel make up the "ground level" of the night<br/>club. The catwalks skirt the edge of the walls with a squared spiral staircase<br/>heading down at each of the four corners of the room.<br/>Lights are sparse and dim, letting the patrons bring their own in the form of<br/>chemical glow sticks or LEDs as seems to be the style of the moment. Neon<br/>lines the bar top and arches over the wall behind it, where the more exotic<br/>forms of liquor sit on several layers of glass shelves.<br/>============================================================================<br/>Contents:<br/> Minkar<br/> Bobby_Newmark<br/> Ari<br/> Naze<br/> Ashen-Shugar the Valheru.<br/> China<br/> Jamie floatz on his magic carpet.<br/> Trispis<br/> Locke The Invisible Emmisary<br/> Walker<br/> Kalain<br/> Shire (Rules &amp; Regulations Officer)<br/> Javelin<br/>Obvious Exits:<br/> &lt;O&gt;-Out<br/>LogBot is active and now logging events it it's location.<br/>Mail: You have no current folder<br/>Mail: You have no mail<br/>Walker says "2:05 here."<br/>Ari says "Well....shall we?"<br/>China says "and I'm sure Javelin has 1pm."<br/>Javelin was told 2pm EST<br/>Locke intones "2:01, says me timeserver query query"<br/>Javelin says "Which is now. :)"<br/>China grins, "I'm always an hour early on yours. :)<br/>Jamie says "we get the idea. How about let's start with a couple introductions<br/>for some of the people at least. I'am Jamie and current owner of this MUSH.<br/>I've attempted to gather people from various different aspects of the MU*<br/>world which it looks like we have a few at least."<br/>Walker says "People are weird. I asked 20 of them what time it is and they all<br/>gave me different answers!"<br/>Walker sits down and turns quiet<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "the problem with the comsys I made, is that I kinda made a<br/>mess of it while i was working on moving from the old muse comsys to the new<br/>one. and it's deMUSE specific .. but I would be willing to help you guys use<br/>it for MUSH :)"<br/>Jamie says "first we've got Javelin, maintainer of PennMUSH and owner of<br/>M*U*S*H amoung other things."<br/>Ashen-Shugar grins "You know I wante dit :)"<br/>Ashen-Shugar idles to see if he can't drag Brazil here.<br/>China applauds.<br/>Walker applauds<br/>Javelin waves, but isn't "first" by any standard in this crowd. :)<br/>Bobby_Newmark will be idle off and on, as I am at work. I apologize in<br/>advance. I'll read all backlog.<br/>Jamie says "we've also got Bobby_Newmark, maintainer of DeMUSE and owner of<br/>the muse by the same name."<br/>China applauds.<br/>Trispis applauds twice.<br/>Bobby_Newmark laughs. "Yeah, i'm one of those freaky MUSE people" :)<br/>Ashen-Shugar grins.<br/>Jamie says "Ashen-Shugar, maintainer (or at least one of em =) ) of Rhost,<br/>which this game is running on."<br/>Walker quotes Shakespeare, "oh for a MUSE of fire"<br/>Trispis applauds again.<br/>Ashen-Shugar grins "So I'm the one to blame for the weirdness of this codebase<br/>(more or less) :)"<br/>China applauds again.<br/>Locke blames ashen-shugar shamelessly ;)<br/>Ashen-Shugar grins.<br/>Walker wrote weirder before and wiped it out.<br/>Bobby_Newmark laughs<br/>Jamie says "Ari, developer of the up-coming OOMUS codebase which not yet<br/>playable has alot of promise in my opinion...

Let's<br/>start this off with a little object lesson."<br/>Jamie says "Bobby, would you step up to the Mic? ;)"<br/>Shire has disconnected.<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "sure."<br/>Jamie says "ok, for this part we have a test dummy of sorts in Guest1."<br/>Jamie says "let's assume he is a guest on your game Bobby. Let's see how you<br/>would handle him."<br/>Guest1 has arrived.<br/>China raises an eyebrow.<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "Oh. heh."<br/>Ashen-Shugar sits back and passes around popcorn.<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "I'm pretty good with bad people, usually. particularly<br/>hackers (since I was one :))"<br/>Guest1 says "join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join<br/>my game: my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game:<br/>my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com<br/>4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game:<br/>my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com<br/>4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game:<br/>my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com<br/>4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game:<br/>my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com<br/>4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game:<br/>my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com<br/>4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game:<br/>my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com<br/>4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game:<br/>my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com<br/>4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game:<br/>my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com<br/>4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game:<br/>my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com<br/>4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game: my.game.com 4201join my game:<br/>my.game.com 4201"<br/>Trispis says "Ouch."<br/>China blinks.<br/>Jamie says "it's a common occurance Trisp."<br/>Ashen-Shugar nods "Yea, it is."<br/>Bobby_Newmark&lt;to guest1&gt;: Umm, Hi G1. I was going to welcome you to this game,<br/>but it appears you may have another agenda other than being a participant<br/>here. Are you interested in this game, or do you just wish to advertise your<br/>game?<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "we honestly don't have to much of a problem like that in<br/>the muse arena, but.. :)"<br/>Jamie says "Ok, Bobby has chosen to take the diplomatic approach. Do any of<br/>you disagree with that?"<br/>Javelin wouldn't do that, but doesn't disagree.<br/>Jamie says "we used to years ago man ;)"<br/>Ashen-Shugar notes without first knowing guest's motivies, diplomacy is best<br/>for now.<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "jaime: i took that action only because I don't know who<br/>this person is. if from the host and timing and a particular pattern, i was<br/>able to assertain a problematic repeat ofender, I likely would have just<br/>booted em :)"<br/>Jamie says "how would you handle it Jav?"<br/>Javelin says "I'd boot them. I'm interested in the question "is this a player<br/>that I want?", and my answer is "no". I'm personally less interested, at that<br/>point, in whether they are interested in my game or not."<br/>Ashen-Shugar would have handled it a bit differently than both as well.<br/>Jamie nodz, "shoot Ash."<br/>Jamie says "we're here to learn from each other. Broaden the horizens so to<br/>speak. ;)"<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "jaime: i think it's a very good idea, :)"<br/>Jamie teachez wm how to spell his name.<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "jamie: sorry. I got used to spelling it that way cuz<br/>that's my wife's name spelled that way. habit :)"<br/>Trispis teaches Jamie how to spell 'teaches'.<br/>Trispis smirks.<br/>China laughs.<br/>Ashen-Shugar says "If the guest was a repeat offender or a site I recognized,<br/>I'd just axe them and be done with it. I don't have th etime or energy or<br/>desire to want people who don't want to be part of the mush. If it was someone<br/>new, generally someone new to mushing with not enough info on 'ettiquette'<br/>tend to be, shall we say, over enthusiastic. I'd gently pat them on the head<br/>(metaphorically) mention to please not be so spamming and compliment them<br/>(slightly) on their enthusiasm then try to subtly direct them to more ettique<br/>ways to approach it. Then, depending on their response/continued activity you<br/>either let them remain, or @boot them."<br/>Trispis partially agrees w/ A-S as representing his ideology.<br/>Jamie says "anything to add Tris?"<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "ash: that's very close to what I'd have done. just worded<br/>a lot better :)"<br/>Trispis nods, "If I may."<br/>Jamie says "go ahead. ;)"<br/>Trispis says "The excessive spam indicates one of two major categories of<br/>player types: 1) new, clueless, etiquette-uninformed, or b) deliberately<br/>troublesome."<br/>Trispis says "Before @booting, which of the above needs to be determined."<br/>Ashen-Shugar nods :)<br/>Trispis says "If clueless, @booting them doesn't give them a 'clue'. It just<br/>makes them hate your game."<br/>Javelin hates to take the hard line, but thinks it takes more than MUSH<br/>cluelessness to spam like that. It requires general social cluelessness, which<br/>I don't want. And their opinion of my game isn't of concern to me. My time is<br/>too valuable to try to give clues to the utterly clueless.<br/>Kalain raises his hand.<br/>Trispis says "I say, discover the player type. Respond accordingly. If<br/>troublesome, @boot (after giving them a chance to read your AUP, if you want).<br/>If clueless, guide them to your appropriate venues of information<br/>disemmination (M*U*S*H has a bbgroup for advertising other MU*'s, for example)<br/>and your policies on spamming (or other undesirable behavior).... and, if you<br/>can keep their attention long enough, a website or two on appropriate<br/>behaviors."<br/>Ashen-Shugar agrees partly. But I have run across people who can be taught<br/>relatively painlessly what is proper or not. For people willing to learn, it<br/>takes very little. For those that are (let's be brutally blunt here) dense as<br/>a goard or problematic, I take Javvy's ideal and just cut out the tumor before<br/>it spreads."<br/>Trispis has, FWIW, always been the voice of "pathetic, futile sympathy toward<br/>twinks" on M*U*S*H (the thorn in Jav's side, so to speak).<br/>Jamie says "go ahead Kalain if you have something to add."<br/>Ashen-Shugar chuckles "I used to be that way, but when I hit my 8th year<br/>mushinhg I grew tired and more hard."<br/>Javelin . o O (Not always futile. :)<br/>Javelin gives Ashen-Shugar the secret handshake again.<br/>Trispis says "I understand Jav's perspective. I even appreciate it. I just<br/>don't always agree with it."<br/>Ashen-Shugar does the finishing 'nyuk nyuk nyuk' as he ends the handshake.<br/>Trispis chuckles at Jav and A-S.<br/>Jamie says "Ari, what tools is OOMUS going to offer the administrators to deal<br/>with this type of behavior?"<br/>Kalain says "Our MUSH has a policy about recruiting such as that. New guests<br/>are locked to the guest channel. We don't discourage recruiting as other MU*es<br/>do. We even have a board for it. BUT, we have that board locked so you have to<br/>make it through CharGen to post on it. When we have someone come on and<br/>recruit, one of us patiently explains the policy to the newbie. We tend NOT to<br/>treat them as twinks until such time as it's a repeated behavior. Nine times<br/>out of ten, they understand. If they continue to go ahead and break the<br/>policy, we warn them. If they continue, THEN we consider booting them and<br/>logging their IP."<br/>Jamie says "oops, Kalain woke up. One moment Ari."<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "Most newbies are annoying and troublesome. but with a bit<br/>of guidance, they turn out to be very helpful users who help the community<br/>grown and contribute positively to the :has always tried to be inclusive and<br/>tried to increase the population on games by bringing in good users and<br/>converting bad users to good. . . MUSE people were stupid in the past and<br/>tried to run off guests."<br/>China says "has anyone thougth ...without asking further, if the spam was<br/>meant. I assume we're dividign the thing down to ...come join my mud, and how<br/>many times it was said. True, if he logged on and said that, he's not<br/>interested in YOUR mush, just his, but I've found my client zmud, has<br/>unforunately in the pass, caused spamming unintentionally."<br/>Kalain sorries about the delay.<br/>Ari says "N/p."<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "china: that's why I start assuming innocence :)"<br/>Guest2 has arrived.<br/>Kalain says "There's an unregistered flag that gets removed when they complete<br/>CG."<br/>Ari says "This is something I see as an issue for administrative policy; not<br/>for the server to fix. You can't just write an anti-spam feature, or colorful<br/>room descriptions will be truncated, as will any code that a person punches<br/>in."<br/>Javelin snaps for Ari.<br/>Jamie says "actually Ari, Bobby does have an anti-spam tool of sorts.<br/>@blacklist"<br/>Ashen-Shugar notes rhost does in some ways as well.<br/>Jamie says "unless he's ripped it out."<br/>Ari nods.<br/>Ari says "But as far as 'Guest logs in. Guest spams idiocy.', it's hard to<br/>code anything to cover that general case automatically."<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "no. @blacklist is a feature I dcoded so that 2 people who<br/>can't stand one another can exist in the same world."<br/>Trispis says "As does Penn (@sitelock, GAGGED, and some custome widgets as<br/>well)."<br/>China says "zmuds command line doesn't clear when it's entered, and if the<br/>enter key sticks.. oh dear. :("<br/>Ari nods.<br/>Jamie says "@blacklist is for the specific user to invoke though as I<br/>understand it."<br/>Javelin only knows of one, Ari. Registration-only, and no guests.<br/>Ari says "Exactly."<br/>Trispis says "The guest aspect of this situation does create a unique<br/>parameter to address."<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "@blacklist works better than @gag from my understanding.<br/>This prevents the person who set the @blacklist to not see anything that the<br/>blacklisted person says, but also thge blacklister can't be heard by the<br/>blacklisted."<br/>Ari says "Which is just a coded feature to facilitate such administrative<br/>procedure; which, by the way, is excellent administrative procedure."<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "and yeah, it's user to user blocking."<br/>Trispis says "You want to allow guests, but you don't want to allow twinks to<br/>abuse guest characters."<br/>Ashen-Shugar notes does it block third-party tools like $commands or @pemits<br/>or the like?<br/>Ari says "Actually..."<br/>Trispis says "Good point, China. MUTTLite does that, too."<br/>Ari says "I don't like guests. Give them the information on a web page. Let<br/>them learn about MU*ing from places that don't mind stupid people. And then<br/>make them register for your site if they really want to play there."<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "deMUSE is unique in that we allow everyone. it's pretty<br/>much a free for all unless you harass someone .. we have an anti harassment<br/>policy with what equates to a 3 strikes rule, and a few other rules (like,<br/>don't crash the game on purpose!).. so we have people who hate one another on<br/>the same game. so @blacklist exists."<br/>Kalain says "We have, as I said, a lot of things locked to guests. Channels<br/>and board posting. They can /read/ boards, but not /post/."<br/>Trispis says "Gee thanks, Ari."<br/>Ashen-Shugar notes a mush should have a way to block sites on guests. This<br/>stops a lot of issues with abuse, let alone giving the ability to block guest<br/>from various things. You could block guest from doing anything but wonder<br/>around if you wanted.<br/>Ari isn't 100% serious, Trispis. :)<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "guests are a better way to get new users. I know that i<br/>personally don't go anywhere by random chance if they wont let melog in as a<br/>guest. and I'm not a bad person, IMO :)"<br/>Trispis says "Not to be too sarcastic, but... if everyone had that attitude,<br/>there wouldn't ever be any new players."<br/>Ari says "I know."<br/>Ari says "It's not my actual attitude...I'm always less than totally serious.<br/>:)"<br/>Trispis says "Eventually MU-ing would die from attrition."<br/>Shire has connected.<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "trispis: that's what's happening on MUSE-based worlds."<br/>Ari says "But, guest characters should be for information gathering only."<br/>Bobby_Newmark uses guests to talk to people on the game I'm trying to reach :)<br/><br/>Guest1 has disconnected.<br/>Ari says "They should perhaps be given access to a small area to give the feel<br/>for MU* commands. They should be able to talk on a recruiting channel to get<br/>information. Etc. But they should not have the privileges of actual players,<br/>codewise."<br/>Walker says "why not block all communication from guest except talking? and<br/>limit that to a short length, like 100 characters."<br/>Trispis says "Penn has a feature to disable many commands from guest use in<br/>the config (setting commands 'no guest'). If you don't want them to be able to<br/>speak, page, read +help, etc., just disable them for guests. Let the guests<br/>wander around with only access to 'news' and 'go'."<br/>Ari says "Again, though, that's administrative policy: as Trispis just said,<br/>most servers allow restrictions on guests."<br/>Jamie says "Ok, this seems like a good place to move on. What about the player<br/>who comes with the intention of harrassing a particular person, be that by<br/>spamming them, spreading rumors about them in public places, ect...Do we<br/>simply @boot that person, do we try to sort out what's going on, what in your<br/>opinions would a good administrator do?"<br/>Ari says "You could @nuke the person that they're harrassing. ;)"<br/>Walker laughs!<br/>Trispis chuckles.<br/>Trispis says "What if they're harassing Ari?"<br/>Jamie says "lol"<br/>Trispis says "I suppose that'd be an exception, eh?"<br/>Walker harrasses Ari to see what he does<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "jamie: someone with bad intentions should be banned if<br/>they have a continual pattern of harassment on that particular game."<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "but you can't judge a user by their actions on a different<br/>game."<br/>Ari @nuke Ari ;)<br/>Shire notes that he would really try to sort the problem out. I think pulling<br/>the harrasser aside quickly, and talking to hem could deal with it. If not, I<br/>would be included to start with an @boot, moving on to a @sitelock if needed."<br/><br/>Ashen-Shugar sticks to the policy no cross-mush politics. If they're on th<br/>emush to just cause problems, I don't care the reason, they're gone.<br/>Ari says "I hope nobody here supports OtherSpace's policy on this kind of<br/>thing."<br/>Shire nods to Ashen, "I agree 100% , even if they are a friend ElseMU, I won't<br/>let them cause trouble. As an admin, you need to be impartial at all times."<br/>Trispis says "I have a perfect example to give you, if you'd like, Jamie."<br/>Jamie says "go ahead Tris."<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "what is OtherSpace's policy?"<br/>Trispis says "I only exist (actively) on M*U*S*H. I don't play anywhere else.<br/>I'm a "single game only" type player."<br/>Trispis says "I've been harassed before. Directly, personally, intentionally.<br/>(No names mentioned)"<br/>Ari says "@personal_grudge and @be_an_idiot are both aliases for<br/>@nuke;@sitelock ;)"<br/>Trispis says "I didn't know the guy from Adam (nothign personal to people<br/>named Adam, either)"<br/>Walker suggests adding @harass which, according to the help files, harrasses,<br/>but in fact, @boots you *grin*<br/>Trispis says "He just decided it was his place to harass me."<br/>Kalain says "We investigate. If the harassmentis found to be true, then they<br/>get the @boot. The higher-up admins on the MUSH can decide (as a whole. It has<br/>to be a vote) to siteban. No one person on our MUSH can siteban a person."<br/>Trispis says "We dealt with it (on M*U*S*H) in a very professional manner,<br/>IMO... and it lead to a new system, even. The event, itself, was annoying to<br/>me personally, but in the end the whole MUSH benefited."<br/>Jamie says "let's take this a step further, and I'll give an example."<br/>Ari likes the jury-type system for dealing with that kind of thing, but thinks<br/>that there should be a quicker method in place for /real/ idiots. ;)<br/>Naze has disconnected.<br/>Shire nods, "It is an OOC-Jail, which does not allow for say, page, +bbread,<br/>nor anything else."<br/>China wonders what the new system on M*U*S*H is, Trispis refered to.<br/>Jamie says "the harrassing person uses some trick to fool Penn into not<br/>recognizing his IP (or he had 20+ shell accounts). @boot'ing him didnt do any<br/>good, @sitelock was also useless because of the shere number of different IPs<br/>he was able to have at his reach."<br/>Trispis bets this group would appreciate M*U*S*H's system.<br/>Bobby_Newmark says ":is currently being, and for the past 2 years has been,<br/>harrassed by one user. and he's harassing me because I warned a female friend<br/>of mine that he likes to sleep around, which was true, and I didn't want to<br/>see her hurt. so now he torments me :)"<br/>Walker once saw a system where, in case an admin wasn't around, 3 players<br/>could key in the command and it would boot the player and ban them for a<br/>specified length of time, such as 5-15 minutes.<br/>Javelin says "He has 20+ shell accounts, Jamie."<br/>Trispis says "Oooh. Nice, Walker. *makes a mental note*"<br/>Javelin . o O (probably mostly stolen or freebies)<br/>Ashen-Shugar noddles to Javelin "Time to have a 24 hour register-site."<br/>Jamie says "you remember what I'am talking about Jav?"<br/>Javelin thinks os.<br/>Ashen-Shugar hurms to Walker "Dangerous if the twink is also a hacker."<br/>Jamie says "what would you do in a situation like that? I had to resort to<br/>disabling guests and registration."<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "yes. @blacklist was created for morons just as described.<br/>they can have as many shell accoutns as you want. . @blacklist is a lock. it<br/>can be used to say "I don't wanna talk to x, Y and Z, or, it can be made to<br/>say "I only want to talk to X, Y and Z..."<br/>Jamie says "till the harrasser just gave up."<br/>Shire steps it up, "What do you do when you have an admin that has been fired,<br/>or is not fired, but just demented, and he starts harassing staff for things,<br/>or even worse, he starts harassing players?"<br/>Ari says "Or @nuking #[rand()]"<br/>Ashen-Shugar would probably compile a list and send it to the appropiate<br/>ISP(s). 20 different accounts start to break some ISP guidelines for<br/>purposiful hacking of remote systems. Yes, it's a game, but as it's on a<br/>different machine, it'll fall into that protection.<br/>Javelin would do something similar, Jamie, but also firewall the IPs in use<br/>away from any pennmush.org resource.<br/>Trispis says "Contact their sysadmins, progressively moving upward to their<br/>ISP and backbone providers, Jamie."<br/>Javelin says "Plus what A-S and Tris said."<br/>Ari notes that ISP's never respond. :(<br/>Javelin has had them respond.<br/>Shire has aswell.<br/>Ari is trying to trace a guy down that broke into his development box and had<br/>no response for 5 days.<br/>Javelin says "Especially when it's been one of their machines cracked by<br/>someone."<br/>Ashen-Shugar has gotten over 20 accounts yanked for attempted hacking a game.<br/>All they need is logs and proof.<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "if an admin gets out of line, and they don't run the game,<br/>they get demoted. if the admin runs the game, the people must organize and<br/>leave the game."<br/>&lt;DB&gt; Save!<br/>&lt;DB&gt; Done.<br/>Jamie says "to think though that one person could essentially close down a<br/>game to new players just because he cant play nice isnt acceptable policy<br/>though. At least I dont think it is."<br/>Ashen-Shugar notes other than blocking every single ip/dns the person comes<br/>from, the only immediate response is setting the site register only and<br/>blocking guests.<br/>Shire says, "In my experiance, an admin is very trusted. Weather fired and<br/>allowed to play the game or not, im my books, they start harassigng other<br/>players or other staff, they are nuke'd right away. I just feel that admins<br/>are very trusted..."<br/>Trispis says "Jamie, the incident you're talking about was directed at<br/>M*U*S*H/pennmush.org, as well. We're still open for guests with no<br/>registration. (Admittedly, Jav had to work *VERY* hard to achieve this... and<br/>almost totally single-handedly, for which I am very grateful.)"<br/>Ashen-Shugar notes especially with all the programs these script kiddies can<br/>download that mask ip header information and can alter the dns, and mangled<br/>firewalls that do weird things for reverse dns/auth lookups, it's difficult to<br/>block everything.<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "sitelocking doesn't work."<br/>Ari says "True. The people that don't care to get around it don't have a<br/>reason to, and those that do, do."<br/>Javelin says "If someone really wants to bring you down, and they have<br/>prerequisite skills, the fact is that nothing short of registration works."<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "what you can do, however, is log the sessions, and ask the<br/>user to cease and desist, and if they continue, tell them they are harassing<br/>you and others or whatever and that you wish for them to stop."<br/>Ashen-Shugar noddles to Javelin.<br/>Shire looks to Jav, "And even then Javelin...."<br/>Ashen-Shugar notes if you have hardware access, you can also put in a packet<br/>sniffer and use that to reverse engineer the location.<br/>Javelin says "Sitelocking works very well for one level of idiot. Firewalling<br/>for another. Nothing works for a third unless you're lucky."<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "after collecting enough of a log where it's made clear you<br/>asked them to stop, and made it so you can prove they are who they are, file a<br/>harassment lawsuit.. it only takes a few bucks, but will teach the person a<br/>little lesson :)"<br/>Javelin says "right, Bobby - if you're lucky enough to trace their RL address.<br/>:)"<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "I know all my abusers. :)"<br/>Shire grins.<br/>Ari says "Wanna track mine down? I'll give you $100."<br/>Ari ;)<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "the main problem, is that he's a canadian. but it'd be fun<br/>to do because it'd prevent him from coming to the states without being taken<br/>into custody :)"<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "I know someone who could track them down. :)"<br/>Shire steps it upor is not firedand he starts harassing staff for thingshe<br/>starts harassing players? What if they are just nuking randon players?"<br/>Shire eeks.<br/>Locke ACKS!@<br/>Ashen-Shugar notes in a nutshell, I think we're at this point. IF you're faced<br/>with a grade A hacker, there's not much you can do to save it. You can put inh<br/>all the DoS/spam/etc protectino you want, but the user will then just use FUD<br/>tactis or attack the users online. You can't be everywhere at once, on at all<br/>times at once. The most you can do is hope you never annoy something at that<br/>skill level.<br/>Jamie says "Shire, calm down... ;)"<br/>Ashen-Shugar mentions at this opportune time the NOFLASH flag :)<br/>Shire did not mean to do that.<br/>Shire sorries.<br/>Locke promptly sets that flag o_o;<br/>Splat has arrived.<br/>Locke also wonders why it is that no one *ELSE* has ever coded one of thoser<br/>Ashen-Shugar snugs Splat "long time ol' timer."<br/>Shire grins to Splat.<br/>Ashen-Shugar grins to Locke "No idea. I find it immensely useful :)"<br/>Splat waves. Gee.. I am an old timer now, aren't I ;)<br/>Locke chuckles<br/>Locke intones "Alot of things I wonder about that..."<br/>Shire nods, "When you code for SW:ANT, and do it more than the HC, and code<br/>longer than I have been alive, yes Splat, you are an old timer."<br/>Locke intones "Ideas that are nbotably nice ones, but seem limeted to being<br/>*done* solely in MUCK or Rhost"<br/>Locke intones "well, aside from me own modifications.. but THose are still<br/>being worked out o_o"<br/>Trispis says "Are we drifting?"<br/>Jamie says "well let's step over that hurdle and take a look at people with<br/>the intention to cause harm to the game itself?"<br/>Ashen-Shugar is openly willing to give code/ideas to any hardcoder who wants<br/>it. I believe I already mentioned that to you all :)<br/>Splat says "Anyone mind paging me what we're talking about?"<br/>Locke chuckles<br/>Locke could use some, just to see if they're ones he's aplready working on ;)<br/>Locke has already pored the age-old concept of saystrings from their<br/>previously MUCK only heritage<br/>Jamie says "the type of person who's out to bring the game down or to grab as<br/>much code as he can or to just generally ruin *everyone* else's fun."<br/>Ashen-Shugar grins "yea, we got @saystring, too."<br/>Locke nods<br/>Shire blabers "Yes we do here."<br/>Bobby_Newmark notes that MUSE and other tinymud variants are very different.<br/>Locke intones "Rhost was the only other place I'd seen it.. ^^;"<br/>Ashen-Shugar notes MURE had it for a time as well I believe.<br/>Bobby_Newmark is trying to figure out how come softcode is different. and who<br/>changed it. and when. and why.<br/>Locke intones "I've got one set, don't I? ;P"<br/>Ashen-Shugar nods :)<br/>Javelin nods to Jamie.<br/>Jamie says "mind getting back on topic people? ;)"<br/>Locke intones "Softcode went in to a really odd branhing inn Tinymud<br/>varients... and things like MUF popped up..."<br/>Locke ahems, and nods to Jamie<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "MAZE, a muse variant, has a basic interpreter :)"<br/>Ashen-Shugar grins "It's what happens when you get a bunch of hardcode geeks<br/>in a room. It always degresses to toys, bells, and whistles :)"<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "crap. i might hbave a meeting now. *finds out*"<br/>Locke chuckles<br/>Walker ponders a C++ scripting language<br/>Walker grins<br/>Shire says, "Back to topic now."<br/>Jamie repeatz for those who are finally getting their attention under control.<br/>;)<br/>Jamie says "well let's step over that hurdle and take a look at people with<br/>the intention to cause harm to the game itself?"<br/>Shire thinks that kind of player should be shot.<br/>Ashen-Shugar grins.<br/>Jamie says "the type of person who's out to bring the game down or to grab as<br/>much code as he can or to just generally ruin *everyone* else's fun."<br/>Ashen-Shugar has a unique way to get rid of those kind of players.<br/>Splat says "For players who really want to bring the site down, my first<br/>approach would be a severe warning (For a failed attempt) or an immediate<br/>sitelock, obviously, for a successful attempt. Threatening to call people's<br/>ISPs usually scare's 'em good."<br/>Shire says, "Kicked off, never allowed, and their name and HOST passwed around<br/>a mailing lsist or two."<br/>Shire sorries for the spelling.<br/>Ashen-Shugar notes you don't outright @boot, @nuke, or destroy said player,<br/>you put them into a situation where life for them on the mush is so annoying<br/>they *want* to leave. If they lave on their *own* accord, they are less likely<br/>to come back and/or to cause problems.<br/>Splat says "I've threatened to call someone's ISP once, and the kids parents<br/>found off and kicked him off his computer for a while."<br/>Shire acks and notices, "Sorry, I have not introduced myself yet. I am Shire,<br/>Rules and REgulations Officer here (Kinda like HJ), Norm LeGuard on SW:ANT,<br/>Shire on M*U*S*H, and other people, other places. SOrry for not doing that."<br/>Ashen-Shugar has something on rhostmush that allows you to individually<br/>disable commands on a player. ON a particularilly nasty turdball, he got so<br/>fed up with seeing 'huh?' messages from valid commands he just left for good.<br/>Javelin thinks Ashen-Shugar has a point. I generally find that GAGGED is very<br/>handy.<br/>Splat says "Yes, Ash, but if you run a big MUSH you face a problem where some<br/>players are more satisfied with the general MUSH situation than others. By<br/>pissing off one player, we could lose other players that aren't as annoying."<br/>Splat says "That, in fact, has happened several times on SW:ANT"<br/>Shire nods.<br/>Ashen-Shugar notes you can annoy them in such a way it's private to them so<br/>others are not aware of it, Splat.<br/>Shire has seen it happen ther splat.<br/>Splat nods. With lots of players, word gets out.<br/>Splat says "There's still a Splat hate webpage up.."<br/>Ashen-Shugar nods "Agreed. It's 6 of 1 half a dozen of another. Leaving a<br/>problem player on also looses players. Lesser of two evils."<br/>Javelin notes, while we're on this topic, that I would never @nuke a serious<br/>twink. @newpassword them and set them HALT (so they can't control themselves<br/>via mudnet if you use it), and then keep them around so you never forget their<br/>site(s), etc.<br/>Shire says, "Okay, what would do as an admin, if you saw another admin do that<br/>to a player, like gag them from a channel, and then, mock that player? I have<br/>seen that."<br/>Ashen-Shugar notes I don't agree in openly mock them. I deal with subtilly.<br/>Splat nods. We do that, Jav.<br/>Trispis says "China asked earlier, and I think this is a good place to<br/>interject this..."<br/>China nods to Trispis.<br/>Jamie says "interject away. ;)"<br/>Arcondra has arrived.<br/>Shire notes that he has only ever seen a player get mocked once on any MUSH<br/>for being bad. That was...well, maybe it is better left unsaid. The said<br/>player was VERY rude and did a lot fo bad things, but it really degreades the<br/>MUSH as a whole when an admin lowers themselves to that level.<br/>Trispis says "With lots of discussion among M*U*S*H's admin for guidance, I<br/>softcoded an administrative +sanction system. It works in progression, with<br/>user-definable options along the way. It is automated, so that it appears to<br/>come from the same source no matter which admin uses it (so they can't react<br/>directly to any single admin, based on the source of their punishment).<br/>(continued...)"<br/>Trispis says "+sanction1 simply sends a warning to the player, telling them<br/>they've done something bad and to re-read the 'news AUP'."<br/>Trispis says "+sanction1 also sets the SUSPECT flag."<br/>Shire nods, "SW:ANT has the +warning system."<br/>Splat nods. That's slightly different though.<br/>Shire nods.<br/>Splat says "We also +comment players.."<br/>Shire says, "And the other system..the special FLAG that was added. Dunno if I<br/>can say it exists, since I am not the admin from there."<br/>Trispis says "+sanction2 (also sends a message) implements a specific<br/>punishment (chan/nochat/gagged) for a user configurable time (expressed in<br/>hours)."<br/>Ashen-Shugar thinks in all honesty, it's difficult to have 'set guidelines'.<br/>Each situation with each player and each server it happens on is always unique<br/>in one way or another. You have to use past judgements, history, and any<br/>noticable trends to judge the right action.<br/>Trispis says "+s2 lasts for the specified time, and is removed automatically)"<br/><br/>Jamie says "we used to have the TWINK flag on the old penn adminmush. It<br/>worked similiar to slave except it disabled ALL commands except QUIT."<br/>Shire nods to A-S, "But we are wondering, because this will help us each deal<br/>with problems."<br/>Trispis says "+sanction3 is like +s2, but is indefinite removal of the<br/>specified priv."<br/>Ashen-Shugar nods "Oh, I agree."<br/>Trispis says "+sanction4 is indefinite gagged."<br/>Ashen-Shugar grins "You mean FUBAR, Jamie? :)"<br/>Splat laughs.<br/>Ashen-Shugar grins to Splat "Hey, I like that flag."<br/>Jamie says "actually Ash, I was thinking of slave in MUSE terms. I had<br/>forgotten about FUBAR."<br/>Trispis says "+s2's can be given to minor offenders (people who occassionally<br/>blurt profanities by accident, simply because they haven't yet learned to<br/>control their tongue, for example)."<br/>Trispis says "The idea is... to remove any "personal" nature of the<br/>punishment. the sanction comes from "the whole admin team"."<br/>Locke intones "hm"<br/>China says "do the sanctions go beyond 4, Trispis? And who decides when to<br/>remove the indefinite ones?"<br/>Javelin does.<br/>Javelin says "At 4, they've got to email me, personally, and we have a little<br/>chat by email."<br/>Trispis has intended to @decompile this and put it on ftp.pennmush.org, but<br/>... well, I've never been really proud of my softcode (my personal<br/>kluge-fests).<br/>Jamie says "would you be willing to put this system into the public domain<br/>Trispis so that others might benefit from it? It does sound like a good idea<br/>to assist admin."<br/>Trispis says "All appeals of any +sanction must be directed to Javelin, and<br/>only Javelin, China."<br/>China says "hey... if it works, who cares? :)"<br/>Locke intones "though still, there is always, even with a system such as that,<br/>rasied the issue of inter-administratory desciusions... and that at times,<br/>some of the admins mayu disagree with one admins choice to use it..."<br/>Trispis says "It removes the potential for one admin undoing the sanction of<br/>another admin (I punish China, she whines to Grinna who undoes it. &lt;-- bad<br/>idea)"<br/>China nods. "and I meant the 'if works, who cares?" like toward the style of<br/>coding. :)<br/>Trispis would have to talk to Jav (since it is a global on his game), but<br/>sure... I'd release it.<br/>Arcondra murmurs "I have to disagree.. if there isn't comunication between<br/>wizzes before the +santion is set, the possiblity is still there."<br/>China says "I like the decision to reverse being directed to an 'outside'<br/>sourse."<br/>Locke nods at Arcondra, "Twas what I wass thinking<br/>Splat says "At ANT, we have a policy against "admin circling" about anything..<br/>punishments, approvals, whatever."<br/>Javelin has no objections. "And I echo Arcondra about the communication<br/>thing."<br/>Trispis says "For most players, this +sanction system has been very effective.<br/>It makes the player actually *think* about their actions."<br/>Kalain says "I think the +sanction code would be good, but I do still think<br/>the admins should discuss it."<br/>Ashen-Shugar notes it's why you have to have the 'final say' of the head god.<br/>Right or wrong, that person's decision has to stand. If it's to be reversed,<br/>it *has* to be by that head god.<br/>Locke intones "A situation like that can only be made worse if you get the<br/>admins into arguments about it"<br/>Kalain says "Of course if there are logs of the situation, it makes the<br/>decision easier. ;)"<br/>Trispis says "Oh, yeah, Arcondra. We have guidelines for use of the command.<br/>The admin are encouraged to confer with each other before applying the<br/>+sanction. In fact, they're encouraged to ask another admin to actually do it,<br/>if possible."<br/>Shire nods, "However, the admins should function as a oneness unit.<br/>Javelin also offers our code for tracking all the sites a player has ever<br/>connected from and factoring out variations on the same site (i.e. different<br/>ppp dialups, etc.) and for searching for players who match a site.<br/>Ashen-Shugar wouldn't mind that code, Javvy. Saves me from having to write it<br/>:)<br/>Javelin nods. It was a hassle, too.<br/>Javelin says "This is softcode, btw."<br/>Ashen-Shugar nods "Which is why I said I'd not mind the code, cuz I know it's<br/>a hassle :)"<br/>Trispis nods about the LASTSITES bit... we also have a +sitecheck (to check if<br/>a players LASTSITE matches the collected LASTSITES of any other players...<br/>possibly known to be troublesome).<br/>Splat nods. That's a good idea.<br/>Javelin . o O (Hence the reason for never nuking twinks, only newpasswording)<br/>Javelin . o O (They turn into a db of twink-sites :)<br/>Ashen-Shugar usually @toads them instead of @Nuking.<br/>China likes all these ideas.<br/>Trispis says "Jav coded the bit for collecting LASTSITES, and I wrote the<br/>accompanying +sitecheck (basically a lsearch())"<br/>Locke shall be back momentarily...<br/>Jamie says "Ok, Ash has whispered a good point to me to bring up and I'am sure<br/>you'll all have varying opinions on this...I recall once seeing a bboard<br/>discussion on this actually fill the bboard up completely. ;)"<br/>Locke intones "Lunch time..."<br/>Kalain says "Javelin, the MUSH I'm an admin on would be interested in that<br/>code, and the +sanction code if that becomes available."<br/>Locke ought to grab some food before server maintainance beigns again andnhe<br/>loses his change<br/>Trispis says "Anyway... I wanted to get that +sanction bit out there. It has<br/>been VERY effective for M*U*S*H."<br/>Locke intones "Chance"<br/>Shire nods, "Likewise for the one I code for."<br/>Jamie says "TS, TS with underage players, and just TS in general. Is this a<br/>problem? are they problem players? if so what would you do?"<br/>Trispis says "Any of you who frequent M*U*S*H, feel free to nag me to<br/>@decompile +sanction and make an install script appropriately on some<br/>weekend."<br/>Javelin says "Anyone who wants the LASTSITES code, email<br/>dunemush@pennmush.org. And Tris'll put +sanction up for ftp."<br/>Bobby_Newmark is back. sorry. work happened<br/>Javelin has never had a TS problem, so will just listen. :)<br/>Splat says "What about RPed TS between ICly underaged people? We've had that<br/>problem before."<br/>Trispis says "TS is psychological masturbation, IMO (even removing the RL<br/>masturbation which accompanies it)."<br/>Ari just thinks anyone who'd contemplate tinysex is pathetic.<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "TS is silly. On the other hand, I have found that in the<br/>MUSE world, there's a problem that occurs from RL encounters between users.<br/>Mainly, it drives wedges between two people when the long distance<br/>relationship fails and causes the social groups to break apart into smaller<br/>cliques."<br/>Ashen-Shugar is more worried about RPed TS between a RL underaged person and a<br/>non-underaged person. The FBI has shut down chat sites for this alone.<br/>Kalain says "I've run into a problem of actual TS rape. One player wanted itm<br/>the other didn't..."<br/>Trispis learned about it during his first year of MUSHing. It took a total of<br/>1 experience for me to realize it was bad mojo. It's the kind of thing that<br/>leads old men (like myself) to the potential of being arrested for internet<br/>child molestation (how the hell do I know that girl, if she is a girl at all,<br/>is actually of legal age?).<br/>Ari feels that anything that happens ICly is the responsibility of the<br/>characters (note: not the players).<br/>Splat says "In situations like this, we have a consent system, and a fade to<br/>black policy."<br/>Javelin doesn't think TS is silly or pathetic or masturbation, but also has<br/>rarely ound it a problem issue.<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "in the MUSE arena, we don't have many, if any, under 18<br/>users anymore."<br/>Splat says "It's never actually occured on SWANT though."<br/>Shire nosd, "Splat knows, one mf my old friend's, he was on SW:ANT, and<br/>proceeded to almost TS RAPE a woman. He should have been sitelocked."<br/>Ashen-Shugar notes TS is more an issue on heavilly RP intensive mushes.<br/>Ari thinks Bobby typoed that 81. ;)<br/>Guest2 has disconnected.<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "ari: I dunno. most MUSE people are all 20+ :)"<br/>Ashen-Shugar idles for a meeting in RL.<br/>Splat says "Seeya Ash"<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "in the muse world (back on a slightly old topic, but since<br/>work happened I will comment now), we had a problem with users in nanaimo :)"<br/>Splat says "Go on"<br/>Trispis says "When MUSH 101 was a standalone game, we had strong 'anti-TS'<br/>policies (don't let us find out about it, or we'll ban you from the game). But<br/>that's mostly because we designed our theme to encourage new (i.e.,<br/>potentially under legal age of consent) players to join our game. Beyond that,<br/>I'd say it's a personal issue. A personal choice of how daring you want to be<br/>on the net, or how appropriate/necessary it is for your RP."<br/>Minkar has disconnected.<br/>China says "I don't see TS as a problem if done privately, unless it's with<br/>someone unwiling, or done with someone underage."<br/>Kalain says "We have very strict consent rules. And we're a PG-13 MUSH."<br/>Jamie says "with me it's not really that big of a deal. If two consenting<br/>adults (that's where the big risk comes in, knowing if it's two consenting<br/>adults) want to TS, then let em as long as it's done outside of public<br/>venues."<br/>Trispis says "Personally, I think it's bad mojo, though. If your character and<br/>some other character needs to have intercourse (say, to create an heir to the<br/>throne, for example), this can be achieved by factual assertion (we "did the<br/>deed in private"), without actually RP-ing or claiming a bunch of X-rated<br/>stuff (we "did it doggy style")."<br/>China says "to kiss and tell, is not 'adult'. :)"<br/>Splat nods. Personally, I find it to have no place on a SW MU*, but people do<br/>it, in private, and it's fine, because we couldn't enforce the rule.<br/>Jamie says "Trispis, that also depends on the players. Just because they<br/>choose to TS does that make them problem players or twinks?"<br/>Walker says "on an SW mush, don't stick Kirk with Yeoman Rand"<br/>China says "adn if they do it 'privately' and maybe the usage souold be 'keep<br/>it private'. Who's to know they're doing toding anything?"<br/>Trispis says "Like I said. It's my personal opinion."<br/>Splat says "Kirk isn't SW..."<br/>Kalain says "It doesn't make them problem players, UNLESS one doesn't<br/>consent."<br/>Walker meant ST<br/>Trispis says "I choose not to. I do not begrudge others if they choose to do<br/>so."<br/>China deletes her 'toding' from her last line.<br/>Splat says "So what do we do about underage people? Do we ask people? Or do we<br/>ignore it entirely?"<br/>China says "personally I don't care what two concenting 'adults' do with their<br/>free time. I know Captain Kirk never let the Enterprise go down in flames<br/>cause he comm'd he was 'other wise occupied at the moment'."<br/>Trispis says "That's why I choose not to, Splat. Too many unknowns."<br/>Javelin thinks China hasn't read the books he's read. :)<br/>Jamie says "she's also not into your line of work Jav. ;)"<br/>Splat says "That's what we do too. We're safe, because we have no knowledge<br/>that these people are underage."<br/>China says "Kirk did let the Engerprise 'die' while 'busy'? :("<br/>Locke intones "When TS is an RP matter, I think, it holds mostly to a matter<br/>of A&gt; consent, and B&gt; privacy... like any other matter of RP, if one person<br/>does nae OOCly concent to it, its powergaming just as if it were combat... And<br/>if they do, then it moves on to the matter of privacy, its a private sort of<br/>RP, and what any two characters/players decide they want to RP out of the<br/>public eye is their own bluidy choice. As long as they are nae doing it in a<br/>public area"<br/>Trispis says "If they are underaged, your ignorance of that won't keep the FBI<br/>from sending you to prison if the victim's parents discover it and press<br/>charges."<br/>Javelin . o O (*giggles* and thinks about the "KS" genre of fanporn, in which<br/>Kirk and Spock are lovers into hardcode BDSM)<br/>Splat says "Charges of what?"<br/>Ari has to run..<br/>Arcondra murmurs "a MUCK I was on when I first started had an Over 18 flag..<br/>it was set by the player as a statement of age. it simply covered the MUCK<br/>from liabilites.."<br/>Locke nods<br/>Ari says "Later....Jamie, mail me the log if you would. :)"<br/>Ari has disconnected.<br/>China says "er.. I was refering to tv shows, Jav. I don't read 'those' books.<br/>:)"<br/>Locke intones "And any area which were 'adult' oriented, requires this flag be<br/>set for a player to enter...."<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "on deMUSE we conform only to state law in teh state in<br/>which we operate. which is kentucky :)"<br/>Trispis says "Contributing to the dilinquency of a minor, psychological abuse<br/>of a minor, so on and so forth."<br/>Locke intones "if someone esets this, and is not in fact of legal age, then<br/>its fraud upon the part of the player..."<br/>Arcondra nods to locke, who was on said MUCK.<br/>Trispis smiles. Rewrite the laws if you think you can hide behind 'that minor<br/>lied about their age'.<br/>Shire notes that a MUSH simply needs a disclaimer.<br/>Splat says "Well, who do they sue? Our ISP? The payer of the account? Me?"<br/>Shire notes they cannot sue, as long as a warning is in place.<br/>Shire says, "Like websites, with porn."<br/>Javelin says "They can always sue. Maybe, they can't win."<br/>Trispis says "If a minor uses a fake ID to enter a bar and drink alcoholic<br/>beverages, the bartender is still liable for serving alcohol to a minor in<br/>MANY instances."<br/>Splat says "Yes, but we are not serving TS."<br/>Javelin says "But they can cost you enough to make it not worth your while. I<br/>had been planning to run an all-child MUSH, and I was going to get parental<br/>permission forms."<br/>Shire shakes his head to Trispis, "Actually, no. I work in a Casino, if the<br/>Minor produces ID, which, looks real, and I cannot tell is fake, then I am no<br/>longer liable."<br/>Trispis says "If you're *having* TS with a minor..."<br/>Jamie says "Ok, time to reign it in again. We're getting way off topic. Does<br/>anyone else have any points that they would like to bring up about problematic<br/>players/twinks?"<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "The best wayt to resolve a situation is with an unbiased<br/>3rd party. whether that be admin or otherwise."<br/>Splat says "It is something illegal that is happening on our server. Should<br/>EFnet or any of the other major IRC networks be responsible for what they<br/>transmit?"<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "should AT&amp;T and responsible for what's said on the phone?"<br/><br/>Splat says "I have something.."<br/>Arcondra grins at jamie, "you started it."<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "should gun manufacturers be responsible for gun crimes?"<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "oh wait.. :)"<br/>Trispis says "Should the owner of the parking lot be held liable for the drug<br/>deals people engage in thereon?"<br/>Locke is nae even going to go there<br/>Javelin notes that there's some technical legal issues around 'common carrier'<br/>status, Splat. If you're not responsible for what you transmit, you may be<br/>required to not monitor/censor/etc any transmissions, either.<br/>Trispis says "But should and will are two different things entirely."<br/>China says "no. A gun is only a tool. As good or as bad as the man who uses<br/>it."<br/>Walker peers at bobby, "Should 100 hunters and 100 gun owners with self<br/>defense guns have to give up their lifestyle and safety because 1 guy shot<br/>somebody?<br/>Splat says "On another note, how far should wizards go to prove a player they<br/>think is lying, is lying?"<br/>Arcondra murmurs "it's not a tool. it's a weapon, but back to twinks."<br/>Trispis says "suspect logs, splat."<br/>Trispis says "I do have another issue, though, Jamie..."<br/>Jamie says "please Trispis. ;)"<br/>China quoted the author who wrote "Shane".<br/>Trispis says "The use of logs in adjudicating player misconduct."<br/>Jamie says "good one. Thoughts? Comments?"<br/>Bobby_Newmark usues suspect logs only in severe harassment cases, or in cases<br/>where someone keeps crashing the game every time I'm 20 minutes idle.<br/>Trispis says "How do you determine how much "tampering" has been done?"<br/>Trispis says "I regularly edit any logs I send to Javelin (to remove<br/>irrelevant spam, simplifying his job)."<br/>Arcondra murmurs "as far as telling how much of the log actually occured?"<br/>Trispis says "Does this mean I can't be trusted?"<br/>Jamie says "in other words how do you determine if the log is in fact what<br/>really happened?"<br/>Locke intones "Well, though its not suspect logs, when asessing a complaint<br/>log from a player..."<br/>Splat says "What about reading the maildb?"<br/>Locke intones "I'd find it prudent to simply verify with someone else who may<br/>have seen it happen, or the target of the complaint"<br/>Splat says "Or some way of watching players in real time?"<br/>Locke intones "Even the worst of twinks, will rarely outright deny the<br/>contents of a log unless its been changed, merely the harm of what they did"<br/>Arcondra murmurs "we don't want to go big brother on the world."<br/>Trispis says "Right. How do you determine a log submitted by playerX (playerY<br/>was harrassing him) hasn't been edited (removing pages of playerX to playerZ,<br/>who as in turn harassing playerY)?"<br/>Javelin usually takes all player-mailed logs with a grain of salt, and goes<br/>and talks one-on-one with the people involved about what happened.<br/>China says "or how well you know your players. Particularly the one filing the<br/>complaint."<br/>Locke points at his previous commenfor Trispis, and nods at Jav<br/>Splat says "I'd only truly trust admin's log. If player a logs player b and<br/>player b says the log is fake, we have to believe him unless other proof can<br/>be found."<br/>Javelin . o O (Unless they're all SUSPECT)<br/>Locke intones "its an administrative judgement call, I'd say"<br/>Shire nods, "I would have to talk to other admins on that one."<br/>Jamie says "in enough cases to make it relevent though the players in question<br/>arent set suspect at the time of the incident."<br/>Shire would have to find out that person's general demenor, past, ect.<br/>Arcondra murmurs "mostly I'd say refering it to past experience.. is player Y<br/>a known trouble maker, or do they have a vendetta against player X?"<br/>Trispis says "This is one more reason why our +sanction1 sets the suspect<br/>flag. Once we determine (via the SUSPECT logs) that this player has, indeed,<br/>learned to behave, we can remove the SUSPECT flag."<br/>China says "I think all situations need investigated, not jsut assumed on<br/>hearsay, or evidence that can be tampered with."<br/>Locke intones "It helps in this situation, also, indeed, to make sure that ye,<br/>as an admin responsible with that sort of thing, knows the players they must<br/>deal with on thier MU*..."<br/>Splat says "What I'm trying to get at is.. is it ethical to log/read mail of<br/>players that you aren't certain have committed a rule violation?"<br/>Locke intones "Thoughnit becomes more difficult on larger MU*s.... Its still a<br/>necessity"<br/>Trispis says "Splat, you're treading on miranda and search warrant issues<br/>(from US law). It's a touchy subject. Reasonable suspicion, and all that."<br/>Trispis says "I suppose it boils down to administrative style."<br/>Javelin says "that only applies to the police, Tris."<br/>Javelin says "Not to private citizens."<br/>Trispis says "Right."<br/>Trispis says "Which is why I made the administrative style comment."<br/>Arcondra murmurs "but what laws trispis, have boundery on an international<br/>data world."<br/>Arcondra murmurs "?"<br/>China knows from personal experiance most sexual harrasements have been though<br/>pages.<br/>Splat says "I know we have the legal right to log everything that goes through<br/>since we own the game..."<br/>Trispis points up ^^^, "Please don't assume I'm asserting that admins should<br/>abide by precidents set in US law. I was simply using that as a point of<br/>reference. I said specifically, 'It's a touchy subject'"<br/>Arcondra murmurs "we do splat, IF we tell them that's what we do."<br/>Splat nods. That's why I brought it up as a point of discussion.<br/>Arcondra murmurs "but personally I don't like doing that."<br/>Trispis says "Reading the mail of other people bores me."<br/>Locke intones "Its somewhere between legal and ethical, logging everything<br/>*is* allowed, but if its not informed of, and perused without due cause, and<br/>word get sout.. you *WILL* lose players... Players covet their privacy"<br/>China says "and least mine have been. But I'm not saying pages now to start<br/>being logged by the mushes, just that 'my log' and my word are all I have to<br/>give. Beside the fact the person usualy gains a rep for similar actions to<br/>others with time too."<br/>Trispis says "I'm actually more interested in who is involved, than I am in<br/>the content. Is playerX actually carrying on a conversation with playerY when<br/>they say they're not? Stuff like that."<br/>Splat says "It's against SWANT admin rules to read mail, and only people with<br/>site access (The God, HW, and Head coder) can get at the logs."<br/>Trispis says "Tell Javelin to leave me alone; p javelin=You're a jerk.;He's<br/>bothering me.;p javelin=And if you don't stop, I'm gonna have my friend hack<br/>your server.;He's being so mean to me. I want you to make him stop, cuz I<br/>haven't done *anything* to provoke this."<br/>Trispis says "^^ that's the kind of thing I actually discover. And it's not<br/>the content, really. It's the dishonesty (I haven't done *anything* to provoke<br/>this.)"<br/>Javelin must go, alas. Thanks for the interesting discussion, folks. Nice one,<br/>Jamie. :)<br/>Trispis waves!<br/>Splat says "It's common, especially for newbies, to misinterpret the rules or<br/>their "rights""<br/>Javelin has disconnected.<br/>Kalain waves. "Thanks, Javelin, for offering the LASTSITES codce."<br/>Trispis says "oooh. 'player rights' -- another nasty issue."<br/>Splat says "I have this little speech I keep around SW.. one sec."<br/>Arcondra thinks the matter could be simlified somewhat with a bill of players<br/>rights..<br/>Splat quotes: MUSHing here is a /privilege/, not a right! It is /our/ game,<br/>and we can run it how we want. We try to make it fun and fair for everyone,<br/>but if you don't like playing here, leave! We are not corrupt, and we are not<br/>out to get you. We have good reasons behind everything we do, but it doesn't<br/>matter. This is not a democracy. Whining at the admin and making your problems<br/>public only serves to make things worse.<br/>Trispis says "Players have only one right on M*U*S*H. They have the right to<br/>play elsewhere if they don't like our game."<br/>China waves.<br/>Arcondra sees she's on the oposite side of the fence from most other admin.<br/>Locke intones "A player should also have the right, or at least the justified<br/>expectation, of a fair and just administration team"<br/>Splat says "Some people believe players should be allowed to control what<br/>happens on the MUSH a bit. But when you're running a big MUSH with a lot of<br/>newbies, it would be disaster. Fair and just, yeah, but what does that mean?<br/>Not to hold grudges? Our grudges are very justified."<br/>China says "I agree the admins should be fair, but if I find it's not, I<br/>leave."<br/>Splat says "Admins should not say, give their RL friends IC advantages."<br/>Kalain says "Players do have rights. They have the right to not be harassed.<br/>They have the right to be treated fairly. They have the right to be able to<br/>approach the admins with a problem and to be heard out."<br/>Trispis says "Like I said. You have the right to play elsewhere if you don't<br/>like our game."<br/>Jamie says "it's the 'go find another sandbox' theory."<br/>Splat says "My thoughts exactly."<br/>Trispis says "Well, it's the 'this is my sandbox' theory."<br/>Arcondra looks at tris, "that's a bit of over simplification.<br/>Splat heads off for a while. Maybe I'll BBL.<br/>Trispis says "Not really."<br/>Splat has disconnected.<br/>Jamie thinkz the firewall is about to start dropping people again.<br/>Arcondra murmurs "ultimately it is true.. but a player should be able to<br/>expect some things.."<br/>Trispis says "Javelin has said this numerous times. M*U*S*H only exists<br/>because it gives him enjoyment to host it. Once it ceases to give him<br/>enjoyment (on balance), he'll shut it down."<br/>China says "I know games players left, cause of admins."<br/>Trispis says "Same applies to individual players. You make his life miserable,<br/>you get banned."<br/>Trispis says "Meanwhile, you have the right to leave voluntarily, if you don't<br/>like that."<br/>Locke intones "But a MU* is something more than merely the playground for its<br/>admins"<br/>Kalain says "I'm a player first. I always have beem. I always will be. Without<br/>the players, there's no point to having the MUSH or the admins."<br/>Trispis says "Players are free to expect that they won't be spied upon unless<br/>they're suspected of violoating policy somehow. &lt;-- M*U*S*H's AUP states this,<br/>in fact. But it's not a "right to be never spied on". It's an expectation of<br/>fairness which M*U*S*H happens to support."<br/>Locke intones "While yes, those responsible for its creation, its maintanance,<br/>should quaff some enjoyment from it, a MU* exists for those who use it for<br/>what it is, admin *or* player... There is less seperation between the two than<br/>some on either side of the fence would think..."<br/>Trispis says "Please keep in mind that I am endeavoring now (now that Jav<br/>dc'd) to provide whole perspective from M*U*S*H. The fact of the matter is: I<br/>personally believe players (specifically the new, clueless variety) DO have<br/>rights. They have the right to a bit of trial and error in this overwhelming<br/>new world of text-based interaction. They have a right to a second chance<br/>(even a third or fourth if they're actually learning each time). But, Javelin<br/>also has the right to shutdown a player or the whole game if it's becoming a<br/>nuisance for him to leave that player or the game online. I see both sides,<br/>really."<br/>Locke intones "here also, trispis, comes a divergence.. between a social MU*,<br/>and one with a specified purpouse... like a purely RP based MU*"<br/>Arcondra murmurs "tris.. this isn't politics.. prevent your own viewpoint, not<br/>that of your party."<br/>Trispis says "Players should be able to expect that they can participate on a<br/>game without being harassed. But that doesn't mean they can expect to be able<br/>to harass other players and get away with it."<br/>China says "I agree Lock, players should 'want' a fair game, or stalked/spied<br/>on, and a number of things. But you can't MAKE rules that 'each game' god<br/>'has' to abide by. It's not a cd-rom type set up. You can join a group of guys<br/>playing baseball on the next block. You all know the basic rules to 'play' the<br/>game, but if they choose to cheat and tassle you, your best off leaving and<br/>finding a 'niceer' group to play with."<br/>Arcondra changes that prevent to present.<br/>Trispis says "I do present my viewpoints. I also present the fact that my<br/>viewpoints don't always agree with the administration I am part of, but which<br/>I understand and condone."<br/>Locke nods to China, "Nae, of course you can't, tis the responsibiloity of any<br/>admbin as to how they run it... But still, it remains that there is the<br/>general expectation<br/>Trispis says "Then again, as I said earlier, I am a "one game only" type of<br/>player. I only exist (apart from this conference and other such 'one time<br/>events') on M*U*S*H. My perspectives, my ideologies, and my behaviors are<br/>tainted by that fact."<br/>Walker has disconnected.<br/>Trispis senses the party dwindling.<br/>Jamie says "well, is everyone having fun? ;)"<br/>Trispis enjoyed the discussion very much, Jamie. Good job.<br/>Kalain nods. "Very informative."<br/>&lt;DB&gt; Save!<br/>&lt;DB&gt; Done.<br/>Trispis stops his log and heads back to M*U*S*H. Thanks, Jamie.<br/>Trispis waves all around and poofs.<br/>Trispis has disconnected.<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "dang work."<br/>Bobby_Newmark says "got back just in time to see people leave."<br/>China says "but I look for a game that the admin don't 'favor' their friends<br/>over me when it comes to my efforts being evaluated for something, taht I can<br/>go to them if I havae a problem and it will be treated seriously and fairly,<br/>as per how it concerns me, etc, etc. But I don't always find it. But as a<br/>player I do look for it, or close to it. I'm flexable ...until it's obvious<br/>it's not the kind of place I want to be."<br/>Jamie deactivatez logbot.<br/>Jamie gently shows you the door.<br/>Thank you for visiting The Admin MUSH...<br/><br/>*** RhostMUSH Disconnected ***
