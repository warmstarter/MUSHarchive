        MUSH Manual Version 2.008:<br/>   Copyright 1993, 1994, 1995, Lydia Leong (lwl@netcom.com / Amberyl)<br/>   Last revised 5/22/95.<br/><br/>Section IV: Wizard's supplement<br/><br/>8.

If something is <br/>mentioned that doesn't exist in 2.0, and you're only interested in 2.0,<br/>ignore it.  If you're going to play with the 2.0 wizard commands that <br/>aren't covered in this section, you probably know what you're doing and <br/>therefore don't really need those commands covered in this manual anyway. <br/>All wizards, however, will probably find something useful in section 12, <br/>which provides general rules for wizarding. Mortals may find it interesting <br/>reading.<br/><br/><br/>8.  Owning and seeing everything<br/><br/>8.1     Special Privileges, ROYALTY, and Powers<br/><br/><br/>A wizard, by definition, owns and controls everything except for God.<br/>A wizard may manipulate any object by using its dbref number, or by using<br/>*player. Remote get, look, and examine work, and a wizard may bypass the HAVEN<br/>flag by using "w *&lt;player&gt;=&lt;message&gt;" to whisper a message.<br/><br/>A wizard may look at anything by looking at the dbref number, or by<br/>looking at *player. Warning: in 2.0 this triggers the odesc and adesc messages.<br/>The format of "look" for wizards is somewhat different: the object's name<br/>and dbref number is displayed on the line above the description. When looking<br/>at exits, the full exit name - including aliases - is displayed. <br/><br/>Wizards can teleport to anywhere. In 1.50, the NO_TEL flag and <br/>teleport locks do not have any effect at all on wizards; in 2.0, however,<br/>wizards ARE affected by teleport locks. In 2.2, this is configurable.<br/><br/>The UNFINDABLE flag does not prevent wizards from locating a player.<br/>A wizard can also obtain a player's location by using loc(*player), and get<br/>any attribute. There is _nothing_ in the database that a wizard cannot see,<br/>except for things like the password attribute and other "internal"<br/>dark-to-all attributes.<br/><br/>The LWHO() function allows wizards to obtain a list of dbrefs<br/>of connected players. Also, in 1.50, wizards may watch connects and <br/>disconnects by setting the MONITOR flag on themselves, or grant the <br/>ability to do the same to another player. (NOTE: the 1.50 MONITOR flag<br/>is NOT like 2.0 MONITOR; the equivalent of 2.0 MONITOR is 1.50 LISTENER.<br/>2.0 has no equivalent of 1.50 MONITOR). In both 1.50 and 2.0, WHO for <br/>wizards shows an extended listing with connect sites and other special <br/>information; to see the listing that mortals get, use the command DOING <br/>instead.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>Pern version 1.14 introduced a ROYALTY flag (which can optionally be<br/>turned off at compile-time). This flag is settable by wizards. Objects<br/>ROYALTY can examine and teleport like wizards, but have no other wizard <br/>powers; all of the statements about wizards above also apply to ROYALTY.<br/>This flag does not exist in 2.0.<br/><br/>PennMUSH 1.50 patchlevel 7 introduced a powers system. This<br/>enables wizards to grant specific objects, including players, the power<br/>to accomplish certain tasks that previous were restricted to wizards.<br/>Also, since the BUILDER and IMMORTAL flags from previous patchlevels <br/>are, intuitively, powers rather than real flag toggles, they were changed<br/>to powers in patchlevel 7.<br/><br/>The powers include "teleport anywhere", "teleport anything", "examine<br/>anything", "boot", and most of the other useful wizard powers, save<br/>the ability to @force/control anything. Players who receive such<br/>powers should exercise them with the same caution a wizard should use,<br/>and they should not be given out lightly. A player granted all the<br/>powers has all the abilities of a ROYALTY, and more, except for the<br/>@rwall command.  Therefore, prudence should be exercised in granting<br/>special powers.<br/><br/><br/>8.2     Attribute ownership - @atrchown and @atrlock<br/><br/>Attributes may be owned independently of objects. An unlocked <br/>attribute can be changed by the owner of the object. A locked attribute <br/>may only be changed by the owner of that attribute. Locked and unlocked <br/>attributes are, for the purpose of triggers and similar evaluation, <br/>exactly the same. <br/><br/>Only wizards may set attributes on things that they do not own. The<br/>most recent player to change an attribute is its owner. Please note that it<br/>does not do any harm for someone else to own one of your attributes. If the<br/>attribute is locked, however, you will not be able to remove it _even if you<br/>are a wizard. A wizard may, however, unlock the attribute and then remove it.<br/><br/>In 1.50, two commands are used to handle attributes. @atrchown <br/>changes the ownership. The syntax is @atrchown &lt;object&gt;/&lt;attribute&gt;=&lt;new owner&gt;<br/>@atrlock governs attribute locks: @atrlock &lt;object&gt;/&lt;attribute&gt;=&lt;on or off&gt;<br/>@atrlock &lt;object&gt;/&lt;attribute&gt; by itself returns the status of the lock.<br/>The 2.0 syntax (which also works in 1.50) is "@lock &lt;object&gt;/&lt;attribute&gt;",<br/>"@unlock &lt;object&gt;/&lt;attribute&gt;", and "@chown &lt;object&gt;/&lt;attribute&gt;=&lt;player&gt;".<br/>A normal "examine" shows the owner and lock status of attributes.<br/><br/><br/>8.3     Object ownership - @chown and @chownall<br/><br/>The @chown command is somewhat different for wizards. A wizard may<br/>@chown any object he is carrying, or any object by dbref number. The syntax<br/>is @chown &lt;object&gt;=&lt;player&gt;. Not that *&lt;player&gt; is _not_ used in @chown.<br/><br/>@chownall transfers the ownership of everything a player owns to<br/>another player. @chownall &lt;player&gt; transfers ownership to the wizard who<br/>executes this command. @chownall &lt;player&gt;=*&lt;new owner&gt; transfers ownership<br/>to another player. Note the use of the pointer. A @chownall should NEVER be<br/>done without the consent of both parties involved, since it is usually <br/>difficult to reverse, especially if the recipient owns a lot of objects <br/>himself.<br/><br/><br/>8.4     The queue - @ps and @allhalt<br/><br/>Wizards can use @ps all to see the contents of the entire queue, or<br/>@ps *&lt;player&gt; to see the queue for one specific player.<br/><br/>When the queue is very full, or a machine is looping so badly or<br/>triggering so many objects that simply halting it is not feasible, the <br/>command @allhalt can be executed. This clears out the entire queue - player,<br/>object, and wait, and displays to all connected players the message, "Your <br/>objects have been globally halted by &lt;Wizard&gt;."  @allhalt should be used <br/>sparingly; if the server is slow, the queue may be full, but it may not <br/>necessitate an @allhalt. In 2.0, this is "@halt/all" rather than "@allhalt".<br/><br/><br/>8.5      The database - @entrances, @find, @search, and @stats<br/><br/>@entrances will work on "here" or on any room number, for a wizard.<br/>@stats can be broken down by player, using "@stats &lt;player&gt;"  Note the <br/>absence of a pointer.<br/><br/>Wizards need to be careful with @find, since @find with no arguments<br/>outputs the list of all objects that the wizard controls - i.e., the entire <br/>database. @search with no arguments, however, only does a @search on the <br/>wizard, printing out all the objects he owns. @search with any arguments,<br/>however, looks through the entire database, not just the wizard's objects.<br/>If you are looking for something, always try to do a @search instead of a<br/>@find, especially if you are on a 2.0 MUSH. @search which is restricted<br/>to a player is _considerably_ faster than @find.<br/><br/><br/>8.6      A note about security and privacy. DARK.<br/><br/>Wizards have enormous power. No notes on a MUSH are private; a<br/>wizard can examine them. Wizards can set themselves DARK, disappearing from<br/>the WHO list. In 1.50, any actions taken by a dark wizard show up as <br/>"Someone" rather than the wizard's name, if the game is so configured.<br/>Wizards cannot listen to whispers or pages, and always show up on a @sweep, <br/>whether or not they are dark. A wizard owns everything; he can change, <br/>destroy, or force it to do whatever he wants (unless it is God).<br/><br/>Because of this, wizards must be VERY careful to make sure that <br/>there are no programming loopholes in their objects which would enable the <br/>objects to @force them to perform certain actions. <br/><br/>Wizards should also be careful to announce their presence, if they<br/>are entering a room and are DARK. There is virtually no justification for<br/>spying on a private conversation (the exception may be listening to two <br/>players plotting how to crash the mud, or something similar).<br/><br/>A wizard should _always_ check the location of a player before he<br/>teleports to that player. Being paged by a player does NOT mean that the <br/>player presently wishes for company. In general, the wizard should also ask<br/>permission to enter the room. A wizard should also never teleport a player <br/>anywhere without asking permission first - this is extremely rude.<br/>Occasionally, one tends to act before thinking, but a wizard should try to<br/>act with courtesy.<br/><br/>Also, remember that in 2.0, wizards who exceed the idle time normally<br/>granted to mortals before an inactivity-timeout boot are set DARK.<br/>Wizards are also booted for inactivity, but can set their @timeout<br/>attribute to an arbitrarily high value; they will not be booted until<br/>that @timeout has expired. Wizards who are DARK from inactivity have a<br/>"d" next to their time instead of a "D", in the WHO list.<br/><br/>In 1.50, wizards are never booted for inactivity. They are, however,<br/>set DARK at the mortal inactivity limit, if they are already set UNFINDABLE.<br/><br/>If you are the sort of person who tends to forget that he is set DARK,<br/>you might want an automatic reminder given to you when you move. The<br/>following is useful for this:<br/><br/>@move me=[switch(hasflag(%!,Dark),1,WARNING: You are set DARK.)]<br/><br/><br/>8.7      The Master Room and Command Processing<br/><br/>In both 1.50 and 2.0, the command parser goes through the steps <br/>shown here looking for a match on the command.  If it finds one at a <br/>particular step, it stops and performs it.  If more than one match<br/>(say, multiple south exits from a room), one is picked at random.<br/>$-commands are an exception to this rule, in that ALL $-commands that match<br/>are executed, except that the master room is only checked for $-commands<br/>if none are matched in the check around the player.<br/><br/>The 2.0 evaluation order:<br/><br/>- Uppercase commands (WHO, QUIT, etc) if typed at a terminal.<br/>- Prefix-character commands (", :, ;, etc)<br/>- The 'home' command.<br/>- Exits in the current room.<br/>- Exits in the master room<br/>- Internal commands.<br/>- $-commands in the following places, all checked in parallel:<br/>   - Objects in your inventory.<br/>   - Objects in your current location.<br/>   - Your location (the room itself)<br/>   - You (optionally)<br/>- $-commands in the ZONE chain of the player's location<br/>- $-commands in the ZONE chain of the player himself<br/>- $-commands in the following places, all checked in parallel:<br/>   - Objects in the master room.<br/>   - The master room itself.<br/><br/>The 1.50 evaluation order:<br/><br/>- Uppercase commands (WHO, QUIT, etc) if typed at a terminal.<br/>- The 'home' command.<br/>- Prefix-character commands (", :, ;, etc)<br/>- Exits in the current room.<br/>- Internal commands.<br/>- Enter aliases on objects in the current room.<br/>- Leave aliases on the object you are in, if applicable.<br/>- $-commands in the following places, all checked in parallel:<br/>   - Objects in your current location.<br/>   - Your location (the room itself)<br/>   - Objects in your inventory.<br/>- If nothing has been matched:<br/>   - If the zone of the player's location is a parent room,<br/>- Parent room exits<br/>        - All $-commands on objects in the parent room<br/>   - Else,<br/>        - All $-commands on the zone object of the player's location<br/>- If still nothing has been matched:<br/>   - All $-commands on the player's personal zone<br/>- As a last resort, when matching still fails,<br/>   - Global exits (Master Room exits)<br/>   - All global $-commands ($-commands on objects in the Master Room)<br/><br/>In both 1.50 and 2.0, the Master Room contains exits and commands<br/>which are global to the entire MUSH. This should be used with caution,<br/>as having a lot of global commands slow down the MUSH. Make sure<br/>something is really necessary before adding it to the Master Room. If<br/>it's only useful in some specific area of building, consider using a<br/>Zone instead (see the later section of this manual).<br/><br/>Also, because it is necessary to check every attribute on every object<br/>in the Master Room for commands which don't match anything, the number<br/>of attributes on objects in the Master Room should be kept to an<br/>absolute minimum.  It is also a good idea to keep the number of<br/>objects in the Master Room down, since every object represents an<br/>additional UseLock which must be checked.  As a general rule of thumb,<br/>if an attribute doesn't contain a $command, it shouldn't be on a<br/>Master Room object. For convenience, some data attributes can be kept<br/>on Master Room objects, but this should be avoided whenever possible,<br/>even if the data attributes are set No_Command.<br/><br/>Note that the parents of objects in the Master Room, and, in 2.2,<br/>parents of objects which are contained by a ZONE chain, are not<br/>checked for $commands. This allows you to place data attributes on<br/>the parent, for easy reference, thus leaving you with little excuse<br/>for ever having non-essential attributes on the object itself.<br/><br/><br/>9.  Wiz-specific commands<br/><br/>9.1      Talking with other wizards<br/><br/>MUSH code provides the commands @wizwall, @wizpose, and @wizemit.<br/>(In 2.0, these are @wall/wiz, @wall/wiz/pose, and @wall/wiz/emit). Note <br/>that none of these use an = sign. @wizwall and @wizpose are really the same <br/>command;  "@wizwall :&lt;pose&gt;" is equivalent to "@wizpose &lt;pose&gt;"  In the <br/>case of @wizwall &lt;message&gt;, it is  "Broadcast: &lt;Wizard&gt; says, "&lt;message&gt;""  <br/>In the case of @wizwall :&lt;pose&gt; or @wizpose &lt;pose&gt;, the format is,<br/>"Broadcast: &lt;Wizard&gt; &lt;pose&gt;". @wizemit &lt;message&gt; shows the other wizards <br/>"Broadcast [&lt;Wizard&gt;]: &lt;message&gt;"<br/><br/>1.50 provides @rwall, @rwallpose, and @rwallemit. They work<br/>identically to the @wiz variants, except they send messages to both<br/>royalty and wizards, prefixed with "Admin:" instead of "Broadcast:".<br/><br/>Only connected players may hear these messages.<br/><br/><br/>9.2      Public messages<br/><br/>Wizards can shout using @wall &lt;message&gt;. There is no way of blocking<br/>out shouts; therefore, this should be used sparingly. It sends the<br/>message to every connected player.<br/><br/>Wizards can set the Message of the Day using @motd &lt;message&gt;. The<br/>message stays up until another wizard resets it, or the MUSH goes down. The<br/>MOTD is shown to players when they connect, and when they use @listmotd.<br/>Wizards also have a @wizmotd, which is shown to all connecting wizards.<br/>For wizards, @listmotd displays all MOTD messages.<br/><br/>2.0 refers to these commands as @motd, @motd/wizard, and @motd/list.<br/><br/><br/>9.3      Locking out players<br/><br/>In certain situations, there may be a need to disable all non-wizard<br/>logins. 1.50 code provides the @login &lt;on or off&gt; command. When @login is <br/>off, all player connections will be refused - after the welcome screen, the<br/>message set by using @rejectmotd &lt;message&gt; is displayed and the player is <br/>disconnected.<br/><br/>In 2.0, the command to use is "@enable logins" or "@disable logins".<br/>The @enable and @disable commands may be used to tweak other things as<br/>well; this is probably the most commonly used of the options. The message<br/>displayed to players who cannot connect may be set using @motd/down.<br/><br/><br/>9.4      Dealing with players<br/><br/>There is no easy way to retrieve the lost password of a player.<br/>Therefore, it is simpler to simply use @newpassword &lt;player&gt;=&lt;new password&gt;.<br/>The player is informed that the wizard has changed his password. The player<br/>should then log in and change his password to something else that the wizard<br/>doesn't know. Never @newpassword a player without his knowledge, unless<br/>it's an emergency.<br/><br/>@pcreate is a command which only works if the MUSH is compiled under<br/>registration. @preate &lt;player&gt;=&lt;password&gt;  creates a player with the name and<br/>password. You may not create two players with the same name.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>@boot *&lt;player&gt; can be used to force a player to disconnect from the<br/>MUSH. This is the general punishment for being obnoxious, or for idling for<br/>too long. If you are @booting someone for idling, you should, in general, <br/>page them with a warning five minutes before doing the @boot.<br/><br/>@boot has another use -- killing off sessions of players who<br/>are unable to disconnect, due to network problems. Generally, in this<br/>case it is best to use "@boot/port", which allows you to boot a specific<br/>question. In 1.50, the wizard WHO shows descriptor numbers; in 2.0, you<br/>must use the SESSION command to get the descriptor number of a connection.<br/>"@boot/port &lt;descriptor number&gt;" then closes that specific connection.<br/>Players will often request to have "frozen", dead, connections @booted.<br/><br/>In 1.50, players will be booted with a message notifying them that<br/>they have been booted off the game. In 2.0, players will also be told who<br/>booted them off, unless "@boot/quiet" is used, in which case the player<br/>will simply be abruptly disconnected without any kind of notification.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>@toad turns a player into an ordinary object, called "A wart toad<br/>named &lt;player&gt;" (1.50), or "A slimy toad named &lt;player&gt;" (2.0) and @chowns <br/>all his objects to the wizard doing the @toad. The player will be booted off <br/>the game, prior to being turned into an object.<br/><br/>@toad is actually somewhat redundant. @dest *player will @boot the<br/>player, @chown all his objects to the executing wizard, and @destroy the<br/>player itself. If possible, use this instead of @toad (TIM code and MUSE,<br/>however, may be somewhat different.)<br/><br/>Be careful with @destroy #&lt;dbref&gt;. There is no check to see who the<br/>object belongs to or what it is - be _very_ certain that you have the right<br/>object number, or you may end up irretrievably blowing up an object which <br/>represents hours of programming. There is no way to retrieve @destroyed <br/>objects other than rooms (which may be set !GOING). 1.50 prevents this <br/>somewhat by forcing wizards to use @nuke to destroy objects which do not <br/>belong to them; please don't use @nuke as your standard command for<br/>destruction, or you'll defeat the purpose of this safeguard!<br/><br/>The wizard command "slay" is a "kill" which always works. There's<br/>generally no reason to use it, unless programming a puzzle or something<br/>similar; all it does is give the player some money and send him home.<br/><br/><br/>9.5      Dumping the database<br/><br/>The command @dump writes the database to disk. In 1.50, this can <br/>take anywhere from a minute or two to half an hour - make sure not to do <br/>overlapping @dumps. Overlapping dumps can cause crashes, incomplete database<br/>writes, and other assorted undesired effects.<br/><br/>In 2.0, you don't generally need to worry about doing dumps, as the<br/>disk database is saved fairly often and loss from crashes tends to be<br/>minimal.<br/><br/>The command "@shutdown" shuts down the MUSH. It first does a @dump,<br/>gives all connected players the name of the wizard who did the<br/>@shutdown, and the message "Going down - Bye", then drops all<br/>connections. Don't do this without a very good reason.<br/><br/>Note: if you have database damage and are shutting down because the<br/>game will crash or doing something else equally nasty in a few<br/>moments, DON'T! The straight @shutdown will save the database and your<br/>damage will be permanent. In such a dire situation, you have two options:<br/>find the God (or other person with direct access to the MUSH account) and <br/>have him "kill -9" the process, or do a "@shutdown/abort". This will cause<br/>the MUSH to dump core and die, allowing for the damage to be assessed later<br/>by someone skliled with a debugger.<br/><br/><br/>10.      Database control<br/><br/>10.1     Quotas - limited object creation<br/><br/>If quotas are turned on, the command @allquota &lt;limit&gt; displays the<br/>current quotas and objects owned by all players, and then resets their quotas<br/>to the new limit minus the number of objects they currently own.<br/><br/>@quota &lt;player&gt; reports the number of objects a player owns, and<br/>his quota still available. @squota &lt;player&gt;=&lt;limit&gt; reports the number of<br/>objects the player owns and his remaining quota, and then sets his quota to<br/>&lt;limit&gt; minus the current number of objects he owns. If the limit is 0, then<br/>@squota works identically to @quota.<br/><br/><br/>10.2     Money control<br/><br/>Wizards have unlimited money, and can freely give out money to <br/>players using give *player=&lt;money&gt;. Wizards can also take away money from <br/>players by giving them negative money. It is generally not a good idea to <br/>give players vast amounts of money. The command @poor &lt;money&gt; resets the <br/>money of every player on the MUSH to &lt;money&gt;. This command should be used <br/>sparingly, if at all.<br/><br/><br/>10.3     Consistency checking<br/><br/>The commands @purge and @dbck will probably not be used by most<br/>wizards. They check the database for corruption: @purge checks the destroyed<br/>object list and makes sure that all the objects on that list are really <br/>there; @dbck forces the database to run an internal cleanup and consistency <br/>check every ten minutes. @dbck automatically executes @purge.<br/><br/>In 1.50, if, for some reason, your database is corrupted but the<br/>game is still up (usually through a bug in the internal compression routines),<br/>you will find that an attempt to dump the database will cause a segmentation<br/>fault and core dump (i.e. a nasty crash).  You can generally get a clean<br/>database write by using the "@dump/paranoid" command, which very thoroughly<br/>scans the database before writing it to disk, checking for non-printable<br/>characters and the like. Someone with access to the game's account should<br/>then log in, back up the paranoid dump, and then kill off the game process<br/>in some manner.<br/><br/>2.0 provides the ability to do some database repair within the<br/>game. The first of the db repair commands is "@cut"; this cuts off the<br/>object or exit chain at the wizard's location by setting the "next" field<br/>of the object to NOTHING. The objects or exits beyond the cut retain<br/>their location, but are not accessible except via dbref number. <br/>They can be pasted back into their proper places via the @fixdb command.<br/>This command allows you to more or less arbitrarily set the fields of<br/>an object -- the contents, exits, location, and next pointers, as well<br/>as the owner, value, and name. These commands are NOT to be used unless<br/>you are CERTAIN you know what you are doing, as it is possible (and indeed<br/>rather easy) to produce database inconsistencies/loops which can hang<br/>or crash the server.<br/><br/><br/>11.      Zones<br/><br/>This section only applies to PennMUSH 1.50.  Please see a later section<br/>of this manual for a description of Zones in TinyMUSH 2.2.<br/><br/><br/>11.1     Object zones<br/><br/>A Zone Object (or, alternatively, ZMO - Zone Master Object) is<br/>simply an object that other objects have their zones set to. Objects<br/>that have their zone field set to a ZMO are referred to as being in that<br/>ZMO's zone. There's nothing at all special about a zone object, aside from <br/>that property.<br/><br/>Anyone who passes the enter lock of a ZMO has control over objects<br/>in that zone. Someone who has control of an object via passing the enter<br/>lock on the ZMO can do many things that the object's real owner can do,<br/>including examining the object, changing its attributes, and setting flags<br/>on it. Two notable exceptions are the @chown and @destroy commands, which<br/>are reserved to the object's real owner. Also, players NEVER control other<br/>players.<br/><br/>This control property of zones makes it possible for two or more<br/>people to work on a project together. A wizard is needed to @chzone a player<br/>to a zone; henceforth, everything that player builds is automatically part<br/>of that zone. The wizard-only @chzoneall command changes the zone of <br/>everything a player owns. Wizards should not change the zone of a player<br/>without first obtaining the approval of all other players in that zone.<br/><br/>For example, if I, Amberyl, wished to work on a project together<br/>with Annalyn and Tavella, I would @create an object (let's call it MyZone),<br/>and then "@elock MyZone=*Amberyl|*Annalyn|*Tavella". This would allow<br/>myself, Annalyn, and Tavella to control all objects in the zone.<br/>(PLEASE NOTE: wizards should never be in a zone with anyone! It's far too<br/>easy for a regular player to abuse an item belonging to that wizard).<br/><br/>Players may @chzone their own objects to a ZMO that they own,<br/>or are in the enter lock of. It isn't necessary to be personally zoned<br/>to a ZMO in order to be able to control objects in it (the only criterion<br/>is the enter lock of the ZMO); it is perfectly possible to be zoned to<br/>something else (or Nothing), and @chzone the stuff you build to the<br/>desired zone.<br/><br/>Zones have several other nifty features. First of all, $-commands<br/>on the ZMO are "global" to rooms that are part of that ZMO, and to things<br/>which are personally part of that ZMO. Also, objects can perform a<br/>"@zemit &lt;zone&gt; = &lt;message&gt;" to emit a message to all rooms in that<br/>zone. This command is computationally expensive and costs 100 coins, but<br/>it can be very useful if you have, for example, a space station which<br/>uses an intercom system for announcements.<br/><br/><br/>11.2     Parent room zones<br/><br/>Parent rooms are a slightly more complex version of zones.<br/>The main difference is that, instead of the ZMO being a thing, the<br/>ZMO is a room. All information above about object zones also applies<br/>to parent rooms.<br/><br/>Parent rooms have several more useful properties. First,<br/>a parent room is a bit like the Master Room. It is treated as "global"<br/>by objects which are zoned to it. If you are in a room zoned to a<br/>parent room, you can use exits in that parent room. You can also<br/>use $-commands defined on objects placed in the parent room.<br/><br/>This essentially allows you to create small areas on the MUSH<br/>with their own local "global" commands and exits, without cluttering<br/>up the Master Room. Since local commands take precedence over global<br/>ones, you don't have to worry about global commands interfering with<br/>your local parent room ones.<br/><br/>Unless you want to use parent room exits, you should use<br/>object zones. Object zones are faster, and cause less overhead for the<br/>server to worry about; this is an important consideration if the<br/>MUSH is big.<br/><br/>11.3      ZoneMaster players<br/><br/>One final type of zone control is possible, using a player with<br/>the ZONE flag set. Such players, called ZoneMasters, behave like ordinary<br/>players, but any object that they own is controlled by whomever passes<br/>the ZoneMaster's enter lock. For convenience, objects which pass the<br/>ZoneMaster's enter lock are referred to here as "zone controllers".<br/><br/>Zone controllers are able to @chown objects to the ZoneMaster.<br/>However, such objects count against the original owner's quota, and the<br/>object's creation cost remains charged to the original owner, not to the<br/>ZoneMaster. This enables quotas to be set on individual players, while<br/>still allowing a "builder character" to own all the objects.<br/><br/><br/>The ZoneMaster is more secure than a ZMO, since INHERIT objects<br/>may be placed within the zone without any abnormal danger; since all<br/>objects within the zone have the same owner, there is no danger of having<br/>one's unzoned objects @forced through a security hole. Unlike a standard<br/>ZMO, however, the ZoneMaster does not act as a master object; $commands<br/>are not inherited off it. <br/><br/>Note that this is different from standard zoning in that the<br/>"zoned" objects are actually owned by the ZoneMaster; thus, it is possible<br/>to use @chzone to place the object in yet another zone, for the purpose<br/>of inherit $commands, and so forth.<br/><br/>11.4      Local wizard control<br/><br/>It is possible, through use of zones, to have "local wizards".<br/>This is accomplished by @chzone'ing all players that you want the<br/>local wiz to control, to a ZMO (or parent room; ZMO will be used in<br/>this discussion to refer to both). This ZMO should be @elock'ed to<br/>just that local wiz. That player will then have control over all objects<br/>created by players in that zone. Unlike a real wizard, however, he may<br/>not @force players.<br/><br/>This may or may not be desirable, depending on your philosophy<br/>of administration (assuming you are a god). Local wizards have almost<br/>all the powers of normal wizards, without the accountability and expected<br/>responsibility of full wizards. Although certain systems, such as MUSE,<br/>have used player ranks in a way similar to local wizards, they do not<br/>give such complete control to non-wizard (or wizard-equivalent) players.<br/><br/>It is the recommendation of this writer that local wizard<br/>control only be used if the MUSH is extremely large, and organized into<br/>big, but mostly self-contained, groups which require an administrator who<br/>must be able to control the objects of his underlings.<br/><br/><br/>12.       The Fundamental Laws of Wizarding<br/><br/><br/>The section below comes from a "lecture" that I've given new<br/>wizards on MUSHes that I'm a "senior" wizard on. I've had several requests<br/>for it in printed form, so it appears here, as kind of a summary to this<br/>section of the manual. It summarizes rules for wizard conduct, and gives<br/>a nutshell guide to wizard commands. The full lecture is available via<br/>ftp from the same site where you obtained this manual; it will probably<br/>be called "wiz-ethics" or something similar. All administrators are highly<br/>encouraged to read the full lecture; this manual only hits the highlights.<br/><br/><br/>12.1      Wizard Etiquette<br/><br/>There are three things that players REALLY hate, and which<br/>generally constitute abuse of wizard powers. The first is @forcing a player<br/>to do something. There's really never a reason to do this. You can almost<br/>always duplicate the effect of a command that a player issues by just<br/>doing it yourself. Forcing a player to say or pose something is obviously<br/>unethical. Forcing a player's objects is also generally a bad idea.<br/><br/>Always ask permission before @teleporting a player, or teleporting to<br/>a non-public location, even if the location is JUMP_OK. The first is<br/>just courtesy; the only reason to ever teleport a player is if he<br/>refuses to come of his own free will. It has the potential to mess up<br/>some command the player is trying to execute; waiting a moment or two<br/>for the player to come on his own isn't going to kill you. Following<br/>the second rule will prevent you from teleporting into potentially<br/>embarrassing situations. Just because someone is paging you doesn't<br/>mean that he necessarily wants to talk to you in person.<br/><br/>Don't wander around DARK. If you're going to hang around dark because<br/>you don't want people bothering you, stay in one of your rooms.  If<br/>you encounter another player, announce your presence. The same thing<br/>applies to puppets who are DARK. Some people believe that the best way<br/>to handle player discipline is to teleport to their location, DARK,<br/>and spy on them. This is a breach of ethics, in most cases. Unless you<br/>believe that players are deliberately conspiring to destroy the MUSH,<br/>do not use DARK for anything other than hanging around without getting<br/>bothered by player pages.<br/><br/>Two other brief points: don't examine private objects unless you need<br/>to, and ESPECIALLY, do not use wizard powers to take code or code<br/>segments without permission. In addition, never, ever, wiz while<br/>intoxicated!  Your judgement isn't steady, and you are also very<br/>likely to accidentally mistype a command and cause some sort of minor<br/>(or major) disaster.<br/><br/><br/>12.2       The Five-Step Method of Player Management<br/><br/>If a player is behaving inappropriately, start with warnings and move<br/>up to more direct action. The exception are spammers and those who are<br/>being destructive towards the database; @boot and/or @destroy those<br/>players immediately.<br/><br/>For players who are simply being obnoxious, breaking some of the MUSH<br/>rules, etc., page them and politely tell them that their behavior is<br/>unacceptable. If they don't respond to this "nice" warning within five<br/>or ten minutes, page them again with a more strongly worded warning.<br/>If they continue to misbehave, try a threat: "Do that one more time<br/>and you're going to be @booted."  The next thing to try, if the twink<br/>is being stubborn, is setting the twink GAG. Most people will<br/>disconnect of their own accord if they're gagged. For really<br/>obnoxious, stubborn people, you can then resort to @boot. If the twink<br/>returns, do a @newpassword. Note that if you are planning on doing a<br/>@newpassword to lock out a twink, you should @newpassword _before_ you<br/>@boot, since otherwise, the player can log right back in before you<br/>have a chance to type the @newpassword command.<br/><br/>The reason for using @newpassword instead of @toad or @destroy is that<br/>@newpassword is reversible. You should never use @toad or @destroy on<br/>a player who owns stuff; that is a decision for God to make. Just do a<br/>@newpassword and send mail to the other wizards.<br/>           <br/>   Summary:<br/>      1. Nice warning<br/>      2. Not nice warning / threat<br/>      3. Gag<br/>      4. Boot<br/>      5. Newpassword<br/><br/><br/>12.3       When to use wiz commands<br/><br/>@allhalt:  This is an emergency-only command. It will halt all commands on<br/>           all objects, and clears out the wait queue. If there are any <br/>           objects which need to run continuously, this command should be<br/>           used as a last resort. Try to be considerate and retrigger objects<br/>           that need to run continuously, if you do an allhalt.<br/>@boot:     Never @boot without a good reason. If a player is on twice and<br/>           he can't kill one of his connections, he will generally page you<br/>           and ask for a @boot; don't do one unless he gives you permission.<br/>           The other use for @boot is detailed in the previous section.<br/>@chownall: Never, ever, do one of these without the explicit permissions of<br/>           both of the parties involved. It's not a bad idea to send mail<br/>           to God (or at least make sure he knows) if you do one of these.<br/>@dbck:     The @dbck command is used to force a database consistency check.<br/>           All GOING objects get recycled. Unless you know what you're<br/>           doing, there's no real point to doing one.<br/>@purge:    This checks the destroyed object list for corruption. It's<br/>           normally done as part of a @dbck.<br/>@dump:     In 1.x, you don't want to do overlapping dumps. If you don't<br/>           have FORK enabled, you want to shout before doing one, because<br/>           it will probably cause quite a bit of lag. Otherwise, @wizwall<br/>           that you're doing a dump, so the other wizards know not to do<br/>           one right after you do.<br/>@login:    You can turn MUSH logins on and off with this command. Unless<br/>           you've got some kind of emergency which necessitates locking out<br/>           all players, don't use this. More importantly, don't forget to<br/>           turn logins back on after the emergency is over.<br/>@daytime:  This turns on or off computationally expensive commands. God<br/>           generally makes the decision when these commands should be<br/>           enabled. Turning them off when they should be turned on probably<br/>           won't hurt anything, but turning them on when they need to be<br/>           off has the potential to get God very upset with you.<br/>           Only 1.50 has this command.<br/>@shutdown: In general, only wizards with access to the MUSH account should<br/>           do @shutdowns, so they can bring the MUSH back up afterwards.<br/>           The exception is if the MUSH is not autorestarted, and needs to<br/>           be taken down for a machine reboot or something similar.<br/>           If the database has somehow been corrupted, a @shutdown may or<br/>           may not be a good idea -- this command automatically does a<br/>           @dump, and you might be making your problem semi-permanent.<br/>           When in doubt, contact God; to shut down the game without doing<br/>           a @dump, use @shutdown/abort.<br/><br/><br/>The most important thing to remember: USE COMMON SENSE.<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>That's it for wizard commands and advice.<br/>Comments, corrections, and suggestions should be emailed to Amberyl,<br/>at lwl@netcom.com<br/><br/><br/><br/>
