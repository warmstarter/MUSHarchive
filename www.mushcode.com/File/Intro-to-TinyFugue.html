        Topic: Intro to TinyFugue<br/>Author: Raevnos<br/>Summary: Raevnos an introduction of TinyFugue (TF). Clear and<br/>straightforward, this'll give you most everything you'll need to get started<br/>with the client by which all other clients are measured.<br/><br/><br/> Introduction to Tinyfugue<br/><br/> This lecture will provide a quick-start guide to using the tinyfugue mush/mud<br/>client effectively. It is intented for people who are casual users, or those<br/>just starting out with the client. If you can program your own macros and<br/>triggers, this is probably too advanced for you.  There's a lot of things I'm<br/>not going to mention, so please try to hold off on complaining about things I<br/>missed until the end. If you have questions, raise your hand on &lt;101&gt;, and<br/>I'll get to you.<br/><br/> 1 Introduction<br/><br/> 1.1 What is Tinyfugue?<br/><br/> Tinyfugue, more commonly called tf, is a mush client primarily for unix-like<br/>operating systems, though it can be used on Windows. I haven't done so<br/>personally, but from what I've heard, it's better on NT than 95 or 98, and<br/>even then has problems compared to the unix version.  I assume you already<br/>have tf installed somewhere. If you don't, I'll give a quick install guide at<br/>the end of the lecture. If you have it installed, you can follow along. If<br/>not, the log of this class will be on the Mush101 web site soon.<br/><br/> Tinyfugue is an extremly powerful client, since it has it's own built-in<br/>programming language and support for using it in response to any input from a<br/>game or you. Indeed, many of the client's features are actually implemented in<br/>it's language, making it highly customizable. However, this isn't about<br/>programming for tf, so I won't mention it much more.<br/><br/> 1.2 Starting Tinyfugue<br/><br/> You start tinyfugue by typing 'tf' at a shell prompt. Upon startup, tf loads<br/>any commands from a file named '.tfrc' in your home directory, and connects to<br/>the first defined world - more on both of these later.	If you don't want tf<br/>to auto-connect to a game, start it like 'tf -n'. There's a few other command<br/>line switches, but I'm not going to mention any of them here.<br/><br/> Now that tf is running, it's time to put it to use.<br/><br/>You say, "Let me know if I go too fast."<br/><br/> 1.3 Some useful commands<br/><br/> Normally, when you start tf, you'll see the screen split into two with a line<br/>of dashes. The top part is the output buffer, where text from a mush appears,<br/>and the bottom part is the input buffer, where you can type stuff to go to the<br/>mush. If you don't see this line, try typing /visual on.<br/><br/> All tf commands start with a slash. Anything else is sent to the mush.  <br/><br/> /visual on is a command that attempts to split the screen in two.  If it<br/>doesn't work, there's probably something wrong with the settings of your<br/>terminal.  <br/><br/> The most useful command is /help. It is, obviously, the built-in help system.<br/><br/> /help &lt;command or topic&gt; gives help on the given topic, just like a mushes<br/>help.<br/><br/> /more on is a command that causes new output from the mush to queue up<br/>instead of immediately being displayed in the output buffer. You can scroll<br/>down through the queued text with the tab key. When there's queued text, the<br/>status line will say so on the left side, along with the number of lines in<br/>the queue.<br/><br/> And, of course, you can exit tf with /quit.<br/><br/> 2 Worlds<br/><br/> 2.1 What are they?<br/><br/> In tf terms, a world is a game the client knows about, running on a specific<br/>host and port, possibly with a character and password as well. Multiple worlds<br/>can be defined, and you can be connected to many worlds at once, with the<br/>ability to switch between them at will.  Non-commands entered into the input<br/>buffer will be sent to the currently active world. When new text comes in from<br/>a world that's not the active one, a message will come up letting you know.<br/>Also, the current world is displayed on the status bar.<br/><br/> 2.2 Making a world<br/><br/> Worlds are defined with the /addworld command. Each world needs at least a<br/>name it's called by, a server, and a port. The typical syntax for a MUSH world<br/>looks like:<br/><br/> /addworld -T"tiny" M*U*S*H pennmush.org 4201 Raevnos notmypassword<br/><br/> The -T"tiny" switch tells tf that the world is a tiny-style server.  The type<br/>affects wether or not the world has prompts - like some muds do - and how<br/>auto-login works. In this case, tiny-style servers have no prompt, and login<br/>is done with ``connect &lt;name&gt; &lt;password&gt;''. tf normally does a good job of<br/>auto-detecting type if it's not given, but sometimes net lag can trip it up,<br/>so it's best to always give the specific type. /help /addworld lists more<br/>types for various flavors of muds. M*U*S*H is the name of the world, which is<br/>used to connect to it, among other things. pennmush.org is the server, and<br/>4201 is the port. The last two items are a character name and password. If<br/>these are present, when you connect to the world, tf tries to log in using<br/>them. If they aren't present, you have to log in manually.<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Trispis raises his hand.<br/><br/>You say, "Yes?"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Is the "connect &lt;name&gt; &lt;password&gt;" the only distinguishing<br/>feature of the 'tiny' world type?"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "or is it the only necessary/relevant one?"<br/><br/>You say, "That and the lack of a prompt."<br/><br/> 2.3 Connecting and switching between worlds<br/><br/> You can connect to a defined world with /connect &lt;world name&gt;. You can also<br/>connect to anonymous worlds with /connect &lt;host&gt; &lt;port&gt;.  When you;'re<br/>connected to multiple worlds, you can switch between them in a number of ways.<br/><br/> /fg &lt;world&gt; switches to that world. Esc-f and /fg -&gt; switch to the next<br/>world, and Esc-b and /fg -&lt; switch to the previous world. There's also another<br/>way that I'll mention later. Also, in many cases, you can use ALT instead of<br/>Escape, to the same effect.<br/><br/> When you quit a world, you can no longer make it the active one until you<br/>reconnect to it.<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Trispis says, "Um... another question."<br/><br/>You say, "Yes?"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "I've used tf some... and the esc-f and esc-b things weren't<br/>setup after I installed. I had to get help (and read some of the /help files)<br/>to find out how to put those things into the .tfrc so they would work. Can you<br/>review that briefly?"<br/><br/>Caelum says, "/load world-queue.tf"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Some kind of way to make keycombo's work, or something (my<br/>.tfrc is at home)."<br/>Trispis hrms.<br/>Trispis says, "Maybe it was something else."<br/><br/>Caelum says, "oh, and /load bind-bash.tf"<br/><br/>Raevnos believes those are default keybindings.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Oh... wait. I remember..."<br/><br/>You say, "World-q, which I mention later, is a different way of switching<br/>between worlds."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "I had to /bind ... I wanted them to be ctrl+f and ctrl+b<br/>(instead of esc+)"<br/>Trispis says, "Sorry. /:"<br/><br/>Raevnos nods.<br/><br/>Caelum says, "c-b c-f are char movements by default"<br/><br/> 2.4 Storing and loading worlds<br/><br/> If you quit tf and restart it, you'll see that any worlds you defined are<br/>gone. Luckily, it's easy to save all your worlds to a file, with the command<br/>/saveworld &lt;some file&gt;, which prints out tf code in the given filename that<br/>will recreate the worlds when it's loaded.<br/><br/> But even after you do this, you still won't automatically get those worlds<br/>back when you start tf - you need to use another command, /load, that reads a<br/>file and runs commands in it. In order to do that, you need to use a .tfrc<br/>file. Remember that tf runs any commands in this file on startup. So, just add<br/>a line like /load &lt;world file&gt; in your .tfrc file, and you'll have the worlds<br/>you saved available.<br/><br/><br/>Raevnos mentions them (Ctrl-f and Ctrl-b) too, later.<br/><br/>Caelum says, "I kept meaning to write bind-vi.tf but it turned out a bit<br/>difficult so I didn't go through with it"<br/><br/>Trispis hrms.<br/>Trispis says, "I thought we put our worlds in the .tfrc. ???"<br/>Trispis says, "This is a new one on me."<br/><br/>Caelum says, "this is just an easier way"<br/><br/>You say, "They can go there too if you really want."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "If you /addworld again and /saveworld &lt;file&gt; again, does it<br/>append?"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Or overwrite?"<br/><br/>Caelum says, "overwrite"<br/><br/> Now, you can use the .tfrc file directly for saving the worlds, but there's a<br/>few reasons not to. First, /saveworld overwrites the file it saves to, unless<br/>you use /saveworld -a, in which case it just tacks the worlds onto the end of<br/>the file. If the file already has world definitions in it, you can get<br/>harmless but annoying warning messages about redefining them. Secondly, if the<br/>world file is loaded by the .tfrc file, you can put other things as well in<br/>.tfrc without having to remember to /saveworld -a, as well as put it on the<br/>web or give it to other people without having to edit out passwords.<br/><br/>Raevnos answers. ;)<br/><br/>Trispis grins.<br/><br/> 3 Useful commands, libraries and keystrokes<br/><br/> 3.1 Commands<br/><br/> 3.1.1 /log<br/><br/> You can log output from a world to a file with /log -w &lt;filename&gt;.<br/> When you're logging, the status bar will tell you, and you can turn off<br/>logging with /log off. The -w switch tells tf to log only output from the<br/>world that was current when you start logging. There's a number of other<br/>options to control what gets logged, listed in the /help.<br/><br/> 3.1.2 /recall<br/><br/> Tinyfugue's greatest lacking is not having a truely scrolling output buffer.<br/>You can scroll down through backed-up text with tab, if you have /more on -<br/>but you can't go back easily, unless your terminal program lets you scroll<br/>it's window.<br/><br/> Enter /recall. In it's simplest form: /recall &lt;number&gt;, it will bring up the<br/>last &lt;number&gt; lines and redisplay them. It also accepts a lot of more<br/>complicated forms, recalling according to time, or a pattern it looks for in<br/>lines, and others. See /help /recall for more information.<br/><br/> One other useful form, though, is /recall /&lt;number&gt; &lt;wildcard pattern&gt;.  This<br/>will recall the last &lt;number&gt; lines matching the pattern, which is by default<br/>a wildcard one like the softcode match() function uses.  For example, /recall<br/>/5 *Raevnos* will return the 5 most recent lines with my name in them.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "oooh. neat. (:"<br/><br/>Caelum types /recall /100 &lt;Public&gt; and such alot<br/><br/>Raevnos nods.<br/><br/> 3.1.3 /cat<br/><br/> If you're cut-and-pasting large blobs of text with line breaks in them, you<br/>can use /cat to force it to be sent all as one line to the world.  Once you<br/>enter /cat mode, everything typed in is appended to a buffer, with line breaks<br/>removed, and sent after a line with a single period is entered.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Oh, Excellent. Yeah. Very useful."<br/>Trispis says, "That also looks useful. (:"<br/><br/>Raevnos uses it a lot too.<br/><br/> 3.1.4 @decompile/tf<br/><br/> PennMUSH's @decompile lets you use the tf switch to display an attribute in a<br/>form that a simple tf macro can detect and use to put the attribute into the<br/>input buffer for editing. TinyMUSH and Rhost don't support this, but you can<br/>use softcode to display the attribute in the proper format. See help<br/>@decompile3 on the MUSH for details, and always set your @tfprefix attribute<br/>to help prevent spoofing!<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Trispis says, "No entry for '@tfprefix'."<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Professor Raevnos says, "It doesn't have it's own help entry."<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Trispis says, "Oh."<br/><br/> 3.2 The tf library<br/><br/> Tinyfugue comes with a library of additional commands. I'll cover some of the<br/>ones I find most useful here. All library files can be loaded with /load<br/>&lt;library file&gt;, either in your .tfrc, or from tf directly.<br/><br/> The library itself is located in a directory called tf-lib. It's location<br/>depends on where tf was installed in. ~/tf-lib or /usr/local/lib/tf-lib/ are<br/>common places for it. Help is available for some of them files, via /help<br/>&lt;filename&gt;, or in the files themselves.<br/><br/> 3.2.1 kbstack.tf<br/><br/> This file provides keyboard bindings to keep a stack of text on. You can be<br/>typing something in the input buffer, then store it on the stack, type<br/>something else and send it to the mush, and then restore the orginal text from<br/>the stack.<br/><br/> ESC-Down saves the contents of the input buffer to the stack, and ESC-up<br/>returns the most-recently stored item to the buffer.<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Trispis says, "You got more detail on this one, or should I ask my<br/>question?"<br/><br/>&lt;101&gt; Professor Raevnos says, "Ask."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "You say "most-recently stored item" is returned to the buffer.<br/>I'm guessing that means it can store several things in the stack. When it<br/>returns that "most-recent" one, is it cleared from the stack, making the next<br/>esc-down get the one before that one?"<br/><br/>You say, "Yes."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Okay. Cool."<br/><br/>You say, "It's a last-in, first-out stack."<br/><br/>Trispis nods. Got it.<br/><br/> 3.2.2 world-q.tf<br/><br/> This file provides a keyboard binding for another to cycle through worlds,<br/>going to the next world with activity in it with ESC-w. For example, if WorldA<br/>is my current world, and text arrives from WorldB, I can use ESC-w to switch<br/>to WorldB, instead of having to use /fg or cycle through to it with ESC-f as<br/>described earlier.<br/><br/> When there are no more worlds with activity, ESC-w switches back to the<br/>previous current world.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "That last bit..."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Sorta like the quickview on a tv remote? To switch between two<br/>channels, back and forth?"<br/><br/>You say, "Yeah."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "cool"<br/><br/> 3.2.3 spell.tf<br/><br/> This file allows you to use ctrl-s to spellcheck your input buffer.  Like old<br/>versions of Webster, it only reports misspelled words, but that's still very<br/>useful.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Cool."<br/><br/> 3.3 Keystrokes<br/><br/> These are some useful key combinations, in addition to ones mentioned<br/>earlier.<br/><br/> 3.3.1 Brace matching<br/><br/> When the cursor is on a parenthesis, bracket or brace, you can use ctrl--<br/>(control dash) to move to the matching one. Handy for softcoding.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "ooooh. I'm gonna like THAT one. (:"<br/>Trispis says, "does it actually do matching? or just go to the next closing<br/>one?"<br/><br/>You say, "It goes to the matching one."<br/>Trispis says, "eeeexcellent. (:"<br/><br/>You say, "Hmm. It seems to be esc-- on my tf here at work, but it was ctrl--<br/>on my tf at home where I wrote this. :P"<br/><br/>Trispis nods.<br/><br/>You say, "Wierd. Oh well, use whichever one works."<br/><br/>You say, "Whoever made the tf RPM I installed on my comptuer at home might<br/>have set it up differently, sinc esc-- works on a third tf installation."<br/><br/> 3.3.2 History list<br/><br/> Tinyfugue keeps a history of every line you enter, either tf commands or text<br/>sent to a world. You can cycle to the previous line from your current position<br/>in the history list with ctrl-p, and to the next line with ctrl-n. If you<br/>enter the same thing two or more times in a row, it only takes up one entry in<br/>the list.<br/><br/> 3.3.3 Buffer movement<br/><br/> In the input buffer, in addition to the arrow keys for moving single<br/>characters or rows, there's also keystrokes available for faster positioning.<br/><br/> You can use ctrl-e to move to the end of the buffer, ctrl-a to move to the<br/>start, ctrl-f to move forward one word, and ctrl-b to move backwards one word.<br/><br/> There are also keystrokes for deleting chunks of text, or manipulating words<br/>by making them upper case, lower case, or capitalized. These and others are<br/>listed in /help keys.<br/><br/> 4 Conclusion<br/><br/> There's a bunch of stuff I haven't covered, or only touched on briefly.  This<br/>is an introductory class, and I didn't want to be /too/ overwhelming.  So, if<br/>there's enough interest, we can arrange for continuations, getting more<br/>advanced or covering various topics in detail. But in the meantime, read the<br/>/help, and try out various features.<br/><br/> There's a tinyfugue mailing list you can join and ask questions on, as well.<br/>Information on joining it is at the Tinyfugue homepage, <br/> http://tf.tcp.com/~hawkeye/tf/.<br/> That's also where you can find the source to download and compile.<br/><br/>Caelum says, "we're at 4.0 s1"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "?"<br/><br/>Caelum says, "of the latest TF version"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Oh."<br/>Trispis says, "Um... question/request."<br/><br/>You say, "Yes?"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "I know this is a bit more advanced, but it's common in most gui<br/>clients these days and will probably be interesting to folks."<br/>Trispis says, "Most gui clients these days allow you to have your client<br/>trigger a response to specific displayed text from the game. For example:<br/>Scrabble: It is now your turn. -- In my tf (and I've forgotten how, I just<br/>plagiarize from other peoples' stuff), I have that trigger a /beep 5 (to alert<br/>me it's my turn if I've drifted off to sleep in my la-z-boy."<br/>Trispis says, "Can you give a basic example of that?"<br/><br/>Caelum says, "yeah, I don't think anything has better trigger facilities than<br/>tf at the moment"<br/><br/>You say, "tf can do that."<br/>Raevnos tries an example.<br/>'/def -w"M*U*S*H" -t"Scrabble: It is now your turn" scrabble_alert=/beep 5'<br/>will create a trigger that beeps 5 times when the Scrabble string comes from<br/>the world named M*U*S*H.<br/>You say, "That's an exact match. If you want to match specific words or parts<br/>of a line, stick a * on each end of what you want to match."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "and the trigger is named "scrabble_alert" (just in case they<br/>read about /undef and want to remove it)."<br/><br/>Raevnos nods.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Thanks."<br/><br/>Caelum says, "something else useful, if I want to paste a bunch of crap on a<br/>channel I can type /paste +pub, then /endpaste when I'm done"<br/><br/>Trispis hrms.<br/>Trispis says, "sorta like that thing with /cat and . ?"<br/>Trispis says, "/cat"<br/><br/>Caelum nods.<br/><br/>Trispis says, "I went to the store and..."<br/>Trispis says, "You wouldn't believ what I saw..."<br/>Trispis says, "blah blah"<br/>Trispis says, "."<br/>Trispis says, "I could do the same with /paste and /endpaste?"<br/>Trispis puts "+pub" at the beginning of that /cat example.<br/><br/>You say, "The difference is that /paste will put a prefix before each line,<br/>and /cat glomps everything into one line."<br/><br/>Trispis says, "Ah."<br/>Trispis says, "Okay. Cool."<br/><br/>You say, "One more!"<br/><br/><br/> 5 Installing Tinyfugue on a Unix-like system.<br/><br/> First, download the tinyfugue source from the tf webpage, URL given earlier.<br/>You want the tf 4.0s1 version. Next, unpack it with tar xzf tf-40s1.tar.gz.<br/>This will extract the files into a directory called, surprisingly enough,<br/>tf-40s1.<br/><br/> In that directory, run 'sh unixmake'. You'll see a list of locations where<br/>the tf files will be installed, and be told what to change if you want them to<br/>go in different places. Once all the locations are to your liking, sit back<br/>and do something else for a while while it compiles and installs. Delete the<br/>tf-40s1 directory, and you're ready to go.<br/><br/>Trispis whees. (:<br/><br/>Caelum says, "cool :)"<br/><br/>Trispis says, "And PuTTY is a cool telnet client for Windows, if you need one<br/>of those to access your account that has tf. (:"<br/><br/>You say, "Okay, anything else?"<br/><br/>Trispis has lots more questions, but really has to finish setting up this<br/>fileserver so he can go home and sleep tonight.<br/><br/>David says, "What if you don't run the system? If it's just a shell account?"<br/><br/>Caelum says, "it will put stuff in your home directory, it's pretty<br/>intelligent about it though"<br/><br/>David nods.<br/><br/>Trispis goes back to work. /:<br/>Trispis waves. Thanks again, Raev!<br/><br/>Paul will find that really useful, thanks. :o)
