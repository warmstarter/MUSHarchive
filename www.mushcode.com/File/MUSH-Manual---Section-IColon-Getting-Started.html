In general, a MUSH is a<br/>place where players can hang out, socialize, program, and build. There<br/>are nearly four dozen public MUSHes running at the time of this<br/>writing. Most MUSHes use variants of either the PennMUSH 1.50 or<br/>TinyMUSH 2.0 servers (TinyMUSH 2.2 is derived from TinyMUSH 2.0);<br/>although behavior for all MUSH versions should be similar, code<br/>patches and unofficial modifications are very common, so what works on<br/>one MUSH won't necessarily work on another. This manual describes the<br/>"standard" behaviors for the official MUSH versions.<br/><br/>MUSH looks very similar to the text adventure games that were popular<br/>in the mid-1980s. The difference between a MUSH and an Infocom game is<br/>the crudity of the parser, the user-extendibility, and the<br/>multi-player capability of the former. The programming language of<br/>MUSH is most similar to LISP, in its emphasis on lists and the way<br/>functions are evaluated.<br/><br/>The MUSH code dates back to spring of 1990, or so. The only presently<br/>surviving MUSH from that era is TinyTIM. Somewhat later came<br/>MicroMUSH, and TinyCWRU. All three were based off the original<br/>TinyMUSH, which was a heavily modified TinyMUD, done by Lawrence<br/>Foard.<br/><br/>In January of 1991, PernMUSH was started, using MicroMUSH code as a<br/>base. Moonchilde began to distribute PernMUSH code a little while<br/>later, while MicroMUSH became MicroMUSE. In the spring, the 2.0<br/>rewrite project was started. MUSH had become a messy collection of<br/>hacks, and most of them were non-standard; JT Traub (Moonchilde of<br/>PernMUSH), Glenn Crocker (Wizard of TinyCWRU, Dave Peterson (Evinar of<br/>TinyDungeon), and some other programmers got together to completely<br/>rewrite the MUSH code.<br/><br/>"Vanilla" MUSH code - the unadulterated original by Larry Foard - is a<br/>relic of the past; the MicroMUSH code off which PernMUSH is based has<br/>also essentially disappeared. TinyTIM has never distributed its code,<br/>and is significantly different from the other existing MUSH<br/>codes. These three MUSH versions, therefore, are not covered in this<br/>manual.<br/><br/>PernMUSH switched to 2.0 code in November of 1991. The 1.x code<br/>fragmented into three versions - Spellbound, based off PernMUSH 1.13,<br/>SouCon, based off PernMUSH 1.14, and PennMUSH, based off PernMUSH<br/>1.15, Moonchilde's final distribution. Only the last still exists, and<br/>it was the only one of the three versions to be publicly distributed;<br/>the name was changed to "Penn" to avoid confusion, since PernMUSH<br/>itself switched to using 2.0 (and now, 2.2).<br/><br/>In the fall of 1994, a number of wizards from large MUSHes got<br/>together to discuss the difficulties of TinyMUSH 2.0. TinyMUSH 2.0<br/>releases over the past year had been, by and large, fairly buggy, due<br/>to lack of testing in a "production MUSH" environment (one open to<br/>large numbers of players). Furthermore, gripes about the bugs<br/>introduced with new "features" resulted in the virtual end of<br/>development of new features. It was decided to begin work on a server<br/>development project, called TinyMUSH 2.2 (there had been an aborted<br/>TinyMUSH 2.1 project which attempted to use the UnterMUD OIF format<br/>for a database). TinyMUSH 2.2 is more a continuing of TinyMUSH 2.0<br/>development than an actual new server. It is the pet project of Jean<br/>Marie Diaz (Ambar of PernMUSH), Devin Hooker (Tyleet of Two Moons),<br/>and Lydia Leong (Amberyl of PernMUSH), in conjunction with a number of<br/>other helpful people. Every reference to TinyMUSH 2.0 in this manual<br/>also applies to TinyMUSH 2.2, unless specifically stated otherwise.<br/><br/>This manual is being written specifically for the PennMUSH 1.50 and<br/>TinyMUSH 2.0 / TinyMUSH 2.2 code releases, currently available via<br/>mellers1.psych.berkeley.edu, caisr2.caisr.cwru.edu, and<br/>ftp.cis.upenn.edu, respectively. Should you wonder at the references<br/>to dragons and similar objects throughout this manual, realize that<br/>the examples were originally written to fit the world of PernMUSH,<br/>presently located at astral.magic.ca 4201; as this manual has<br/>evolved, other examples from other worlds, such as The Belgariad (once<br/>at csa.bu.edu 4201) were thrown in, together with more generic<br/>objects.<br/><br/>If you're trying to program any flavor of MUSH besides TinyMUSH 2.x,<br/>or a MUSH version earlier than 1.16, you are better off getting<br/>the version 1.15 of the Pern manual (mushman.1.15.shar.Z, probably<br/>located at the same place you got this manual). This manual is more<br/>detailed than that one; it is intended to cover MUSH programming<br/>extensively. I have tried to make the examples useful; if you work<br/>through the manual's Do It! sections, whether or not you completely<br/>understand them, you should have some rooms built for a house, a<br/>falcon, a vehicle, and some assorted other useful objects.<br/><br/>Please note that the 2.0 examples in this manual assume that your MUSH<br/>has a certain set of "common" aliases and command options. TinyMUSH<br/>2.0 is highly configurable. If something doesn't work, or works<br/>differently from the way it is described in this manual, chances are<br/>that the configuration is different. The command "@list options" lists<br/>many of these options.<br/><br/>Differences between 1.50 configurations are generally less visible,<br/>and generally only affect the way things are displayed, or the<br/>internals of the server, instead of directly changing the behavior of<br/>a command (for example, whether @switch matches all cases or just the<br/>first one).<br/><br/>There are three major mailing lists set up for MUSHers. They are:<br/>tinymush-programmers@cygnus.com (for MUSH programmers and general<br/>users), mushhacks@caisr2.caisr.cwru.edu (server hackers for TinyMUSH<br/>2.0), and pennmush@med-itvax1.bu.edu (server hackers for PennMUSH<br/>1.50).  To join one of the lists, mail &lt;list name&gt;-request@sitename<br/>with a subscription request (i.e., to join mushhacks, send email to<br/>mushhacks-request@caisr2.caisr.cwru.edu).<br/> <br/>   --  Amberyl (lwl@netcom.com)<br/> <br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/> <br/>1. The Basics<br/> <br/>1.1	Some information<br/> <br/>These are terms which are in common use and which you should know:<br/> <br/>Player: the person who is reading this manual.<br/>Character: the virtual-person who wanders around the MUSH under the control<br/>	of the player.<br/>Puppet: an object that is under the control of a character, who can see and<br/>	perform actions of its own.<br/>Robot: something which appears to be a character, but is actually an<br/>	external program, usually written in C or LISP, which, when run,<br/>	connects to a remote computer and pretends to be a player. Some are<br/>	quite sophisticated. This word is also used to refer to objects which<br/>	are programmed, using MUSH code, to behave like players, or to perform<br/>	a specific function, like deliver mail. Sometimes robots will be<br/>	referred to as 'bots.<br/>Machine: Objects which are programmed to do certain things, like dispense<br/>	mugs of klah, or repeat the word "Die" every five minutes, or any one<br/>	of a thousand different possibilities. The second type of robot<br/>	mentioned above is a type of machine.<br/>Flag: Something which controls behavior of an individual object. It can<br/>        be either on or off, and usually affects the kind of output the<br/>        object sees/gives. The '@set' command is used to turn a flag on<br/>        or off on a particular object. A frequently used terminology in<br/>        this manual is "&lt;object&gt; is [not] set &lt;flagname&gt;".<br/>        "Joshua is set OPAQUE" simply means that 'Joshua' has the 'OPAQUE' <br/>        flag set on himself (i.e. it is turned on).<br/>Object Type: Objects are classified into one of four types: PLAYER, THING,<br/>        ROOM, or EXIT. A 'player' is something which can be connected to<br/>        via a name and password, who can own things and functions <br/>        independently of anything else in the game. A 'thing' is a mobile<br/>        object, which can be picked up, dropped, and manipulated in various<br/>        ways. An 'exit' is a link which connects two locations in the game.<br/>        These locations are normally known as 'rooms'. (You can be inside<br/>        a thing, too, but a 'room' is the basic unit of building).<br/>        In this manual, 'object' and 'thing' are sometimes used generically<br/>        to refer to objects of any type.<br/>Dbref: Every object in the database is assigned a number, called a<br/>        "database reference number", or "dbref" for short. A hash sign<br/>        normally prefixes a dbref, i.e., "#100". The dbref is the object's<br/>        unique identifier (unlike its name, which could be the same as <br/>        that of many other objects).<br/>Client: a program which replaces telnet. Clients are designed specifically<br/>	to connect to MUDs, and frequently provide many features that are not<br/>	available with ordinary telnet, such as macros, logging, hiliting,<br/>	and the ability to switch between several worlds very quickly. Two<br/>	popular clients are TinyTalk and TinyFugue. The latter is an improved<br/>	version of the former. Both run under UNIX.<br/>Mark: the unit of currency on Pern. Other places use Pennies, Credits,<br/>	Dollars, or even Cookies. The cost of an action varies from nothing to<br/>	100 Marks, for commands which are computationally expensive. Players<br/>	normally get a certain amount of money every day.<br/>God: the person who is, overall, in charge of the MUSH. He is generally<br/>        responsible for code maintenance and general order. He has powers<br/>        not available to anyone else, and may not be @forced by anything.<br/>Wizard: a game administrator, picked by God to help run the game. Wizards<br/>        control all objects, and have special commands available to them.<br/>        Wizards cannot hear things that ordinary players cannot.<br/>Royalty: a game administrator, a kind of "sub-wizard". Royalty can see all<br/>        objects as if they controlled them, but cannot change them.<br/>Mortal: a non-wizard, non-royalty player.<br/>Control: Every object in MUSH is controlled by one or more things. Players<br/>        always control the objects they own. Wizards control everything.<br/>        There are other ways to control objects; these will be explained<br/>        later.<br/><br/>Commonly used abbreviations:<br/>  IMHO: In My Humble (or Holy) Opinion<br/>  RL: Real Life. The world outside MUDs.<br/>  VR: Virtual Reality. The MUD world or worlds.<br/>  OOC: Out of Character. Used when the player rather than the character<br/>       is the one speaking, such as when a dragonrider character on PernMUSH<br/>       wishes to comment on the features of the latest SPARC station.<br/>       The opposite of this is 'IC' -- 'In Character'.<br/>  LOL: Laughs Out Loud.<br/>  ROTFL: Rolls On the Floor Laughing.<br/> <br/>Now that the definitions are out of the way:<br/> <br/>Examples in this manual will be set off by  [ Example Number ] at the<br/>beginning and = signs around the example. Words that appear in &lt;  &gt;<br/>aren't supposed to be typed in literally. For example, if I use<br/>"&lt;your name&gt;", don't type that, but type your name instead. In examples,<br/>lines that begin with "&gt; " indicate something that I've typed in.<br/>Words that appear in [ ] are optional; for example, if I use<br/>"examine[/brief]", you could either type "examine" or "examine/brief".<br/>Everything else is the MUSH's response. The 'main character' used in the<br/>examples is Elsa, on PernMUSH. Various other characters are used as<br/>props throughout the manual; most of them are PernMUSH players who have<br/>contributed in some way to this manual and are thus being immortalized<br/>by way of thanks.<br/><br/><br/>1.2	Basic Commands<br/> <br/>Looking around:<br/><br/>The "look" command (abbreviated "l") allows you to look at your<br/>surroundings. "Look" by itself shows you the description of the room<br/>you are in. "Look &lt;object or exit&gt;" shows you the description of that<br/>object or exit. You may specify a thing by its name, its dbref number,<br/>as *player, or as "me" or "here". "Read" is identical to look in all<br/>respects.<br/><br/>Possessive "look" allows you to look at something that someone or<br/>something is carrying. The syntax is just: "look &lt;object&gt;'s &lt;thing&gt;".<br/>You cannot look at someone's inventory if they are set OPAQUE or DARK.<br/>(OPAQUE and DARK are flags, and will be explained in more detail<br/>later.)<br/><br/>You automatically "look" at every room you enter. If you are trying to<br/>move rapidly through familiar areas, you may want to set yourself<br/>TERSE.  This flag suppresses room descriptions and room success/fail<br/>messages; the MUSH will display only the location name, its contents,<br/>and the obvious exits.<br/><br/>The MYOPIC flag prevents you from seeing the dbref numbers and flags<br/>on objects that you control. If you like your output "pure", you may<br/>wish to set yourself MYOPIC.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>The "examine" command (abbreviated "ex") provides more detailed<br/>information about an object. If you do not control the object, this<br/>command will tell you who the object is owned by, and (in some<br/>configurations) show you any public attributes on that object, such as<br/>the desc, sex, and "last" connect time. If you are in the same room<br/>with the object, and the object is neither DARK nor OPAQUE, you are<br/>also shown the list of all its non-DARK contents, and any non-DARK<br/>exits. You can also use "examine/brief" to see just the owner's name.<br/><br/>1.50 has the "brief" command. This is like "examine", except<br/>that brief shows all object information EXCEPT for attributes.<br/><br/>In 2.0, if the config directive "examine_public_attrs" is on,<br/>normal players will trigger the looked-at object's adesc when they <br/>examine/full the object, if the object is in the same room. Wizards, <br/>however, do not trigger this.<br/>        <br/>If the object is not in the same room, you do not control it, and the<br/>"examine_public_attrs" config directive is off, you will see &lt;Too far<br/>away to get a good look&gt; instead of the description, and cannot get a<br/>contents list, although you will still see other public attributes and<br/>the owner's name.<br/><br/>If you own the object or the object is set VISUAL, examine will show<br/>you the full list of attributes on the object, and other properties on<br/>it.  To see a specific attribute, "examine object/attribute".<br/><br/>You may use wildcards - * and ? - in examine, to match a group of<br/>attributes. The '?' wildcard matches any single character (but must match<br/>at least one character); the '*' wildcard matches any number of characters<br/>(including "none"). For example, "examine object/v*" would show all<br/>attributes on an object whose names begin with v. "examine object/???"<br/>would match those attributes whose names are exactly three letters long.<br/>"examine object/a?*" would match those attributes whose names are at least<br/>two letters long and begin with 'a'.<br/><br/>In 1.50, if you are set ANSI, the names of attributes and the dbref of<br/>their owners will be hilited in boldface. This makes the boundaries<br/>between attributes clearer, preventing large MUSHcode objects from<br/>looking like several pages of random characters.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/>      <br/>In 1.50, the @grep command can be used to search for a certain<br/>pattern on an object. Doing a "@grep &lt;object&gt;/&lt;attributes&gt; = &lt;pattern&gt;"<br/>prints a list of all attributes on &lt;object&gt; which contain text matching<br/>&lt;pattern&gt;. This &lt;pattern&gt; may contain wildcards. &lt;attributes&gt; is a <br/>possibly wildcarded pattern of attributes to match (like that for "examine"<br/>above). If you merely do "@grep &lt;object&gt;=&lt;pattern&gt;", the game assumes<br/>that you want to search all the attributes on &lt;object&gt;.<br/><br/>@grep can take one of two switches, "list" or "print". The default is<br/>"list", which just returns the list of attributes that match the<br/>pattern.  The "print" option can only be used if you are set ANSI. It<br/>prints out all the attributes which contain the pattern, hiliting the<br/>text which matches the pattern in boldface.<br/><br/>MudCore provides a similar command, called +grep. This performs a<br/>similar task, though it only prints out the list of attribute names<br/>that contain the pattern, rather than printing out the attributes<br/>themselves. The syntax is, "+grep &lt;object&gt;[/&lt;attributes&gt;] = &lt;pattern&gt;".<br/><br/>MudCore also provides another useful command for listing the attributes<br/>on an object, called +lattr; it displays the attribute names, and the<br/>first line of text in that attribute. The syntax for this is,<br/>"+lattr &lt;object&gt;[&lt;attributes&gt;]". The command also takes several<br/>switches, which restrict the attributes displayed to those of certain<br/>types (attributes which are $commands, ^monitors, globally-defined,<br/>or none of the above).<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>The "@decompile &lt;object&gt;" command, when executed on an object that you<br/>own, outputs the sequence of commands you would need to type in order<br/>to duplicate that object. It may be used on any type of object.<br/>        <br/>@decompile is very useful for creating files which can be uploaded<br/>onto another MUSH. To combine @decompile with TinyFugue, use the<br/>following sequence of commands (presuming you want to save an object<br/>called "Test" to a file called "testfile", and then upload it to<br/>another MUSH called "NewWorld").<br/><br/>/wrap off             [ in TinyFugue 3.0 and later:  /set wraplog 0 ]<br/>/log testfile<br/>@decompile Test<br/>/nolog<br/>/world NewWorld<br/>/quote 'testfile<br/>/wrap on              [ in TinyFugue 3.0 and later:  /set wraplog 1 ]<br/><br/>This sequence does the following:<br/><br/>1. Turn off wordwrap so extra newlines aren't inserted into the output.<br/>2. Save MUSH output to a logfile.<br/>3. Decompile the object.<br/>4. End saving of MUSH output to a logfile.<br/>5. Log onto a new MUSH.<br/>6. Upload the object to the new MUSH.<br/>7. Turn wordwrap back on.<br/><br/>This method allows you to easily transport objects across MUSHes.<br/>Also, if the game should unexpectedly crash, or the database gets<br/>corrupted, or some other disaster occurs which causes you to lose the<br/>original copy of the object, all you have to do is upload it<br/>again. You should always try to @decompile any objects that are<br/>especially valuable to you, and store them off-line, in case of<br/>such a disaster.<br/><br/>			----------<br/><br/>Communications:<br/><br/>You can speak using "say &lt;message&gt;", or by typing a double quote<br/>followed by the message (with no space after the "). Your name and the<br/>word "says" will be appended to the beginning of the message. A<br/>trailing " will be automatically added to the end of your message;<br/>don't type one in.<br/><br/>You can pose (emote) using "pose &lt;action", or by typing a colon<br/>followed by the message (i.e., ":&lt;action&gt;"). Your name and a space<br/>will be automatically added. If you want to avoid the added space, use<br/>"pose/nospace &lt;action&gt;", or a semi-colon followed by the message<br/>(i.e., ";&lt;action&gt;"), or a colon followed by a space and then the<br/>message (i.e., ": &lt;action&gt;"). This is useful for doing possessives and<br/>similar things.<br/>	<br/>In 1.50, most messages like "&lt;person&gt; &lt;speech action&gt; &lt;message&gt;" will<br/>include a comma - i.e, 'Annalyn says, "Hi."' or 'Annalyn whispers, "Hi."'<br/>In 2.0, this comma is missing, for historical reasons.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>In 1.50, if you want to send a private message to yourself, you<br/>can "think &lt;expression&gt;". Pronoun substitution and function evaluation<br/>is performed. The equivalent command for 2.0 is "@pemit me=&lt;expression&gt;";<br/>you can achieve a similar effect with "@pemit/silent me=&lt;expression&gt;"<br/>in 1.50, but "think" is easier to type.<br/><br/>There will be many times when you wish to communicate privately.  The<br/>commands "page" and "whisper" (abbreviated "p" and "w") are used for<br/>this, as in, "page &lt;person&gt;=&lt;message&gt;" or "whisper &lt;person&gt;=&lt;message&gt;". <br/>Whisper sends a private message to a person who is in the same room as<br/>you. In certain configurations, people in the same room also see that<br/>you whispered something to that person; most MUSHes, however, do not<br/>use this "noisy" form of whisper. The page command sends a private<br/>message to a person on the MUSH; you can use it to talk to someone in<br/>a different room. The cost of page varies from MUSH to MUSH.<br/><br/>You can whisper and page poses to people, by using a ":" in front<br/>of your message. If you whisper a pose to someone, you are told,<br/>"&lt;Person you posed&gt; senses "&lt;Your name&gt; &lt;pose&gt;".  The person sees,<br/>"You sense &lt;Person who posed&gt; &lt;pose&gt;". If you page a pose to someone, you<br/>are told, "Long distance to &lt;Person you paged&gt;: &lt;Your name&gt; &lt;pose&gt;"<br/>The person sees, "From afar, &lt;Person who paged&gt; &lt;pose&gt;".<br/><br/>Partial name-matching is performed on "page". You only have to type <br/>as many letters of the name as needed to distinguish it from the other <br/>players connected (for page) or the things in the room (for whisper). <br/><br/>"Lastpage" is supported in 1.50; to send a message to the person that<br/>you last paged, type "p =&lt;message&gt;" or "p &lt;message&gt;". "p" by itself<br/>will tell you the name of the person whom you paged last. Try to be<br/>careful with this, since it's easy to mis-type when trying to page<br/>someone different and accidentally sending the message to the wrong<br/>person (this happens a lot when people substitute '-' for the '=',<br/>accidentally).<br/><br/>There are two ways to block pages in 1.50. The HAVEN flag, when <br/>set on a person, prevents them from receiving pages or @pemit *player <br/>messages. Alternatively, the use of a page lock prevents those who do not<br/>pass the lock from paging the player. Anyone who pages a HAVEN player is <br/>told, "That player is not accepting any pages."  Anyone who fails the page<br/>lock will be told, "That player is not accepting your pages."  If the target <br/>player has a @haven attribute set, the message in that attribute is sent to <br/>the paging player. The HAVEN player does not receive any notification that <br/>someone tried to page him.  See the section on locks for instructions on<br/>how to set a page lock.<br/><br/>In 2.0, only page locks can be used to block pages. Players who fail<br/>the page lock will be told, "That player is not accepting pages.", or,<br/>if the target player has a @reject attribute set, the message in that<br/>attribute.<br/><br/>Specifically, to prevent a single person from paging you, use,<br/>"@lock/page me=!*&lt;player&gt;". To prevent everyone except a single<br/>player from paging you, "@lock/page me=*&lt;player&gt;". To prevent<br/>everyone from paging you, "@lock/page me=#0".<br/><br/>If you set an @idle attribute on yourself, anytime someone pages you,<br/>they will have that idle-message sent to them, and you will be<br/>notified that they have received it, together with a timestamp. This<br/>is very useful if you are unexpectedly called away from the keyboard<br/>and want to know when people paged you, while politely notifying them<br/>that you aren't there.<br/><br/>If you sent an @away attribute on yourself, if someone tries to page you<br/>when you aren't connected, they will receive that message. Customarily,<br/>this is used to tell people where you might be, when you will be back,<br/>and where you can be contacted.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>The GAGGED flag, when set on a person, prevents him from doing<br/>anything but moving and looking. This flag may only be set by wizards,<br/>and is used as a punishment for players who are being particularly<br/>obnoxious.<br/><br/>Related to GAGGED is the SLAVE flag. It prevents the player from using<br/>any commands that change the database. It may only be set by wizards.<br/><br/>Flags will be explained in more detail later.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>The "emit" family of commands prints things without any name<br/>prepended. This is handled by switches (the basic command name is<br/>followed by a slash and the switch name) added to the commands @emit,<br/>@oemit, and @pemit. In 1.50, and in many configurations of 2.0, these<br/>command-switch combinations are aliased to shorter commands.<br/><br/>The basic command is "@emit &lt;message&gt;". The message will appear<br/>exactly as you have typed it. Everyone in the room, including you,<br/>will see the message.<br/><br/>In 2.0, normal "@emit" is shorthand for "@emit/here". An alternative<br/>way of doing emits is "\\&lt;message&gt;". There should be no space between<br/>the "\\" and the message. Also, two "\"s are necessary because \ is<br/>used as an escape character.<br/><br/>@emit has another switch, "room". "@emit/room" is often aliased to<br/>"@lemit". It shows a message to the outermost room you are in (the<br/>"absolute room"). For example, if you are in a chair inside a wagon<br/>inside a room, and you perform this command, the message is shown to<br/>the room, not to any of the intermediate objects. There is a limit of<br/>twenty intermediate layers.<br/><br/>Related to the @emit command are @pemit and @oemit, and their<br/>variations.  "@pemit &lt;player&gt;=&lt;message&gt;" will emit a message to a<br/>single person. If the person is in a different room, you must use<br/>"@pemit *&lt;player&gt;=&lt;message&gt;". In 2.0, this normal @pemit is shorthand<br/>for "@pemit/object". In 2.0, you are not told when you @pemit to<br/>someone; certain configurations of 1.50 will notify you that you<br/>@pemit'ed the message. In those configurations, using @pemit/silent<br/>will eliminate the notification.<br/><br/>"@oemit &lt;player&gt;=&lt;message&gt;" will emit the message to everyone in the<br/>room the @oemit'ing object is in, except the named player.  1.50 also<br/>permits "@oemit &lt;room&gt;/&lt;player&gt;=&lt;message&gt;", which emits the message to<br/>everyone in &lt;room&gt; but &lt;player&gt;; the @oemit'ing person must control or<br/>be in &lt;room&gt;. This latter form of the command is somewhat unnecessary,<br/>and thus non-existent, in 2.0; if it can locate where the named player<br/>is, the message will automatically go to that room.<br/><br/>"@pemit/contents &lt;object&gt;=&lt;message&gt;" will emit a message to everyone<br/>in a room or container object, as well as to the container<br/>itself. @pemit/contents is generally aliased to @remit.  The &lt;object&gt;<br/>is generally a dbref number or *player; if the object is a player,<br/>@remit to that player will show the message to all that the player is<br/>carrying, as well as the player himself. Note that @pemit without the<br/>/contents switch does not show a message to anything a player is<br/>carrying, unless the player is set with a @listen attribute of "*".<br/><br/>"@pemit/list &lt;list of dbrefs&gt;=&lt;message&gt;" will emit a message to a list<br/>of objects. These objects must be specified by their dbref numbers.<br/>This version of the command may also be combined with the /contents<br/>list, to send a message to several rooms.<br/><br/>@emit, @pemit, @oemit, and @emit/room do not prepend the name of the<br/>player using the command. If you want to see where these @emit<br/>messages are coming from, you should set yourself NOSPOOF.<br/><br/>In 2.0, NOSPOOF tells you the origin of any output that did not<br/>originate with you, directly or indirectly (i.e. you or an object that<br/>you @forced). If the origin is a player, "[PlayerName(#dbref player)]"<br/>will be prepended to the message. If the origin is an object, <br/>"[ObjectName(#dbref object){PlayerName}&lt;-(#dbref forcing object)]"<br/>will be prepended by the NOSPOOF indicator. The forcing object may<br/>be a controller object, the player himself, or a wizard. It is the<br/>object which caused the command to be executed.<br/><br/>In 1.50, NOSPOOF tells you the origin of any type of @emit, whether<br/>or not you or one of your objects is responsible for it. It prepends<br/>"[&lt;object name&gt;]" to the output (or, if the configuration directive<br/>"PARANOID" is on, "[&lt;object name&gt;(&lt;dbref number&gt;)]")<br/><br/>In 2.0, the HAVEN flag does not block out any type of @emit, though<br/>page locks will block @pemit and its relatives @pemit/contents<br/>(@remit) and @pemit/list; in 1.50, the HAVEN flag blocks @pemit and<br/>@remit to players. 1.50 page locks do not block emits of any sort.<br/><br/>			----------<br/><br/>Going places:<br/><br/>The @teleport command allows you to move to a different location<br/>instantaneously. Two criterion have to be passed in order for you to<br/>be able to teleport to a location: you must pass the room's teleport<br/>lock, and the room must either be JUMP_OK or controlled by you.  You<br/>can teleport to a location by using "@tel &lt;room number&gt;".  You can<br/>teleport objects that you own, using "@tel &lt;object&gt;=&lt;room number&gt;". If<br/>you have an unwelcome guest or object in a room that you own, you may<br/>teleport that thing to any JUMP_OK location. You may also teleport the<br/>thing to another room that you own or through an exit that you own.<br/><br/>In 1.50, and older versions of 2.0, you can find out where a player is<br/>with the command "@whereis &lt;player&gt;". The player will be told, "&lt;Your<br/>name&gt; has just located your position."  @whereis will give you the<br/>name of the player's location, and, if the room is JUMP_OK or is<br/>controlled by you, the number of the location. If you can teleport to<br/>that room, you can go to the player by using "@tel loc(*player)".<br/><br/>Some people find being "@whereis"'ed annoying. Generally, it is rude<br/>to "@whereis" people that you don't know, or to "@whereis" them<br/>without following up with a page message of some sort, explaining why<br/>you wanted to know their location.<br/><br/>Players can prevent others from finding out where they are by setting<br/>themselves UNFINDABLE. In this case, the locating player is told,<br/>"That player wishes to have some privacy."  and the player who is set<br/>UNFINDABLE is notified, "&lt;Your name&gt; tried to locate you and failed."<br/><br/>The UNFINDABLE flag can also be set on rooms. Anything inside an<br/>UNFINDABLE room cannot be located by mortals. Paranoid players and<br/>those having super-secret meetings may like this flag.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there are objects in a room which you may wish to enter,<br/>such as a dragon. You can use "enter &lt;object&gt; to enter an object, provided<br/>that you pass the enter lock on the object, and it is ENTER_OK or owned by <br/>you.  In order to get out of the object, use "leave".  In 2.0, you must<br/>pass the leave lock in order to do this.<br/><br/>You can put enter and leave aliases on objects. The words stored in<br/>the @ealias and @lalias attributes on an object may be used in place<br/>of "enter &lt;object&gt;" and "leave". For example, if a chair has the<br/>@ealias "sit" and the @lalias "stand", "sit" may be typed in place of<br/>"enter chair" and "stand" may be typed in place of "leave".  You can<br/>use multiple aliases by making them semi-colon separated, like exits<br/>are: "@ealias chair = sit down;sit;sit on chair" allows one to type<br/>"sit down", "sit", or "sit on chair" to enter the chair.<br/><br/>			----------<br/><br/>Objects:<br/><br/>Picking up and dropping objects is easy - simply "get" or "drop" the<br/>appropriate object. Possessive "get" also works - you can take from<br/>something using "get &lt;thing&gt;'s &lt;object&gt;". The thing that you are<br/>taking the object from must be ENTER_OK, and the object must not be<br/>locked against you.  Also note that this applies to taking from<br/>non-room objects in general; if you are inside a thing, you will not<br/>be able to pick up obejcts inside of it unless it is ENTER_OK or you<br/>control it.<br/><br/>You can give someone an object or money by using the "give" command,<br/>i.e., "give &lt;person&gt;=&lt;object&gt;" or "give &lt;person&gt;=&lt;amount of money&gt;".<br/>In 1.50, the person must be set ENTER_OK in order for them to receive<br/>things.  In 2.0, the giver must also pass the recipient's ReceiveLock,<br/>and the giver must pass the objects' GiveLock.<br/><br/>To get a list of objects you are carrying, do an "inventory"<br/>(abbreviated "i"). This will show everything you are currently<br/>holding, including DARK objects owned by other players.<br/><br/>			----------<br/><br/>Summary of command syntax:<br/><br/>The basic commands for looking, moving, etc. are few in number and<br/>easy to remember. More complex commands, which generally are used to<br/>change the database, begin with the "@" symbol.<br/><br/>Many commands have "switches" which change the meaning of the command<br/>somewhat. "Examine" is one such command, with /brief and /full<br/>switches. All commands with switches have a default. In 2.0, if a<br/>command has more than one switch which are not mutually exclusive, you<br/>may use several switches at once by doing command/switch1/switch2/etc.<br/>1.50 also allows for switches, but you can only give one switch to a<br/>command at a time.<br/><br/>Flags, mentioned repeatedly above, are used for a wide variety of<br/>purposes. They are either on or off, with "@set &lt;object&gt;=&lt;flag name&gt;" to<br/>turn one on and "@set &lt;object&gt;=!&lt;flag name&gt;" to turn one off.<br/><br/>Finally, three commands are extremely useful: WHO, LOGOUT, and QUIT.<br/>The WHO command, for ordinary players, shows the list of all non-DARK<br/>connected players, the time they have been on, the time since they<br/>last typed a command, and their @doing, which is a short string set by<br/>"@doing &lt;message&gt;". LOGOUT, which only exists in 2.0, disconnects a<br/>player from a character, returning him to the login screen. QUIT<br/>disconnects the player from the MUSH completely.<br/><br/>There is an inactivity timeout. If you idle too long, the MUSH will<br/>disconnect you. The idle time allowed is generally one hour. It can be<br/>found by doing a "@list options" in 2.0, and an "@config" in 1.50.  In<br/>2.0, Wizards may change this value on themselves by setting their<br/>@timeout attribute. Wizards who exceed the inactivity limit for<br/>mortals are automatically set DARK. (In 1.50, this only occurs if the<br/>Wizard is already set UNFINDABLE).<br/><br/>2.0's "@list" command can be used to find lists of all the commands,<br/>flags, attributes, configuration parameters, options, command<br/>switches, and other useful things. Typing "@list" by itself will give<br/>the options. The closest 1.50 equivalent to "@list" is @config, which<br/>outputs the important MUSH configuration parameters.<br/> <br/>===============================================<br/>[Example 1.2: Demonstration of Basic Commands]<br/>&gt; "Hi, everyone.<br/>Elsa says "Hi, everyone."<br/>&gt; :waves.<br/>Elsa waves.<br/>F'jon waves back.<br/>&gt; ex/brief f'jon         [ 1.50: just plain "ex F'jon" ]<br/>F'jon is owned by F'jon<br/>&gt; @emit The sun shines.<br/>The sun shines.<br/>&gt; w f'jon=How are you?<br/>You whisper "How are you?" to F'jon.<br/>F'jon whispers "Fine."<br/>&gt; p jyrax=Hello.<br/>You paged Jyrax with 'Hello.'.<br/>Jyrax pages: Hello!<br/>&gt; @whereis Jyrax<br/>Jyrax is at: Ramp of Ruatha Hold.<br/>===============================================<br/><br/> <br/>1.3	Attributes<br/> <br/>Attributes are places in an object where information can be stored.<br/>The most common are the desc, succ, fail, and drop attributes. Each of<br/>these have corresponding o- and a- attributes. For example, in addition<br/>to succ, there are osucc and asucc. O stands for Other, and A stands for<br/>Action. The name of the person who performed the action, and a space are<br/>automatically prepended to the beginning of every O message. This person<br/>is sometimes called the "enactor"; you will read more about enactors later<br/>on in this manual.<br/><br/>The syntax for setting these and other standard attributes is<br/>"@&lt;attribute&gt; &lt;object&gt;=&lt;message&gt;", as in "@desc me=A young woman."<br/><br/>"Desc" stands for Description. It is the message someone sees when they<br/>look at something. An "odesc" is seen by everyone but the person looking<br/>and the object being looked at. An "adesc" is the list of actions<br/>executed by an object when it is looked at.<br/> <br/>======================<br/>[ Example 1.3a: Desc ]<br/>&gt; @desc me=Elsa is a slim young woman.<br/>Set.<br/>&gt; @odesc me=looks at Elsa.<br/>Set.<br/>&gt; @adesc me=:smiles.<br/>Set.<br/>[Now, if F'jon looks at me, he'll see: Elsa is a slim young woman.<br/> When he does that, Jyrax, who is also in the room, will see:<br/> F'jon looks at Elsa.]<br/>Elsa smiles.<br/>[Elsa's adesc forces her to do a pose, which is displayed to everyone,<br/> just as if she had typed :smiles. as usual.]<br/>=======================<br/><br/>Note that many people find @odescs and @adescs rather irritating.  In<br/>general, one should never use both (the above is for demonstration<br/>purposes only). If you want to be notified that a person is looking at<br/>you, one useful thing is: "@adesc me=@pemit me=%N just looked at you."<br/>(or, in 1.50, "@adesc me=think %N just looked at you.")  The<br/>abbreviation %N is explained in detail later; it means "eNactor Name",<br/>and is the name of the person who triggered off the action.<br/> <br/>Succ is short for success, and is the message seen by someone when<br/>he successfully use something. Succ on an object is displayed when that<br/>object is picked up. Succ on an exit is displayed when something walks<br/>through it successfully. Succ on a room is displayed when someone looks<br/>at it, under normal circumstances. An osucc is shown to everyone else in<br/>the room, and an asucc is the action list taken when something is<br/>successfully used.<br/> <br/>======================<br/>[ Example 1.3b: Succ ]<br/>&gt; @succ me=You lift up Elsa.<br/>Set.<br/>[ Now, when F'jon does a 'get Elsa', he sees, 'You lift up Elsa.'<br/>  Elsa is now in F'jon's inventory, being carried around. ]<br/>======================<br/> <br/>Fail is short for failure, and is the message seen by someone when<br/>he fails to successfully use something. Usually something fails to work<br/>because it is locked. (Locks will be explained in detail, later).<br/>Fail basically works like succ does.<br/><br/>Drop is seen by the person who drops an object. Odrop and adrop have<br/>two uses: normally, they are performed when someone drops something, but<br/>an odrop on an exit is shown to the people in the room that a person<br/>enters (as opposed to an osucc, which is shown to the people in the room<br/>that a person leaves).<br/><br/>===============================<br/>[ Example 1.3c: Fail and Drop ]<br/>[In the previous example, Elsa was picked up by F'jon. She's decided that<br/> she didn't much care for that, so she's going to take some action:]<br/>&gt; @lock me=me<br/>Locked.<br/>[This prevents anyone from picking Elsa up in the future.]<br/>&gt; @fail me=Elsa glares at you.<br/>Set.<br/>&gt; @odrop me=drops Elsa, who looks rather irritated.<br/>Set.<br/>[Now, when F'jon types 'drop Elsa' he just sees "Dropped." since Elsa did<br/> not set a drop message on herself. Jyrax, however, sees: "F'jon drops<br/> Elsa, who looks rather irritated."  Elsa doesn't get any message, except<br/> for the description of the room she's dropped into.]<br/>[F'jon tries to pick up Elsa again, but this time, she's locked, and<br/> 'get Elsa' shows him the message, "Elsa glares at you."]<br/>===============================<br/><br/><br/>The @succ and @drop family of attributes is triggered in one<br/>more case - when objects are given. The giver triggers off the @drop<br/>family of attributes; the recipient triggers off the @succ family.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>There is another attribute, kill, which is used when something is<br/>killed. To kill something, use "kill &lt;thing&gt;=&lt;money&gt;". For every Mark you<br/>spend, you have an additional 1% chance to kill the object. The default<br/>cost of killing something is 10 marks. Spending 100 Marks always works.<br/>Killing something halts it and sends it home, and pays it half the amount<br/>of money that was used to kill it. It also triggers the @kill, @okill, and<br/>@akill attributes (@death, @odeath, and @adeath in 1.50).<br/><br/>Killing is usually strongly discouraged. Certain things, like wizards,<br/>cannot be killed. Objects with the IMMORTAL flag (or, in 1.50, with the<br/>Immortal power) cannot be killed, but this privilege can only be granted<br/>by a wizard.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>The "move" set of attributes are used when something moves from one<br/>location to another, no matter what the means of moving - going<br/>through an exit, entering/leaving an object, going home, or<br/>teleporting. The @move, @omove, and @amove attributes can only be set<br/>on players and objects.<br/><br/>There is also a set of attributes specifically for messages sent when<br/>a @teleport is done. The @tport, @otport, and @atport attributes are <br/>used when you arrive at your new destination. The @oxtport works like<br/>the @otport does, except the message is shown to the others in the<br/>room that you just left. There is no @xtport or @axtport.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>In 2.0, there are a large number of other attributes related to<br/>succeeding or failing in attempts at various commands (usually related<br/>to passing the appropriate lock). Only the "basic" form of the<br/>attribute is listed in the table below; prepend "O" or "A" to it to<br/>get the other forms.<br/><br/>@tfail:  failure in teleportation<br/>@dfail:  failure to drop an object<br/>@gfail:  failure to give an object<br/>@rfail:  failure to receive an object when it is given<br/><br/>The only one of these which can easily be simulated in 1.50 is @tfail;<br/>to get the effect of @tfail, use the "@efail" set of attributes.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/> <br/>The final attribute is not like the others. It's the sex attribute,<br/>which is used for pronoun substitution, and lets you declare your gender.<br/>The syntax is "@sex me=&lt;male or female&gt;". You don't have to make yourself<br/>male or female, but it's strongly suggested. The gender "plural" is<br/>also supported in 2.2, and modifies the grammar of messages appropriately.<br/><br/>There are more attributes, but these are the standard ones.  Certain<br/>MUSHes may add their own global attributes, such as "EMAIL".  It is<br/>also possible to make up attributes with arbitrary names, using "&amp;" as<br/>the beginning of the name rather than "@".  These user-named<br/>("non-standard") attributes are described in greater detail later in<br/>this manual; for now, just note that attribute sets of the format<br/>"&amp;&lt;attribute name&gt; &lt;object&gt;=&lt;value&gt;" are valid and set &lt;attribute name&gt;<br/>on &lt;object&gt; with some text string &lt;value&gt;.<br/><br/><br/>1.4     Editing<br/><br/>One rather useful command is @edit. This allows you to perform a<br/>substitution on an attribute, so you can correct typos without having to<br/>retype the entire thing. The syntax for this command is:<br/>@edit &lt;thing&gt;/&lt;attribute&gt;=&lt;old string&gt;,&lt;new string&gt;<br/><br/>If &lt;old string&gt; is the character ^ by itself, &lt;new string&gt; will be<br/>prepended to the contents of &lt;attribute&gt;. If &lt;old string&gt; is the<br/>character $ by itself, &lt;new string&gt; will be appended to the contents<br/>of &lt;attribute&gt;.<br/><br/>If commas, brackets, parentheses, percent signs, and other 'special<br/>characters' appear in either string, curly braces { } must be used to<br/>set each string off.<br/><br/>If &lt;attribute&gt; is a wildcard pattern, the @edit command does a<br/>global replace for all attributes that match the pattern; for example, <br/>@edit object/v*=a,b  would replace the letter a with the letter b<br/>in all attributes whose names begin with v, in the object.<br/><br/>Certain types of patterns are extremely difficult to edit; these are<br/>usually patterns which include the { or } characters, which are "special"<br/>to @edit. Several methods exist to get around this problem; one is to<br/>generate the string using edit(); the other is to take advantage of<br/>some features of a client such as TinyFugue.<br/><br/>In TinyFugue, type, exactly as printed:<br/><br/>/def redit = /grab $(/recall %{0-1})<br/><br/>This command allows you to pull into your input buffer any number of lines<br/>which could normally be obtained via the /recall command in TinyFugue.<br/>This allows you to edit text that has already been displayed to you.<br/><br/>Therefore, to directly edit an attribute within TinyFugue, one can type,<br/>"examine &lt;object&gt;/&lt;attribute&gt;" and then "/redit 1" to edit the text which<br/>is then displayed.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>To copy an attribute from one object to another, you can use:<br/>@force me=&amp;attrib1 object1=get(object2/attrib2)<br/><br/>It is also possible to copy attributes via a version of the @set command:<br/>@set &lt;new obj&gt;=&lt;new attrib&gt;:_&lt;old obj&gt;/&lt;old attrib&gt;<br/>This copies &lt;old attrib&gt; from &lt;old obj&gt;, setting it into &lt;new attrib&gt; <br/>on &lt;new obj&gt;.<br/><br/>This somewhat clumsy method can be worked around by using a built-in<br/>command -- @mvattr, and, in 1.50, @cpattr.<br/><br/>"@mvattr &lt;object&gt;=&lt;old name&gt;,&lt;new 1&gt;,&lt;new 2&gt;,&lt;etc.&gt;" will move an<br/>attribute.  Moving an attribute always wipes it out. If you want to<br/>copy the attribute, you must move it to itself as well, using<br/>"@mvattr &lt;object&gt;=&lt;old name&gt;,&lt;old name&gt;,&lt;new name 1&gt;,&lt;new name 2&gt;,&lt;etc.&gt;"<br/><br/>In 1.50, there is, in addition to the @mvattr, a copy command: <br/>@cpattr &lt;obj&gt;/&lt;attr&gt;=&lt;obj1&gt;/&lt;attr1&gt;,&lt;obj2&gt;/&lt;attr2&gt;,&lt;etc.&gt;<br/>This copies &lt;attr&gt; from &lt;obj&gt; to &lt;attrN&gt; on &lt;objN&gt;. You can specify a <br/>large number of object-attribute pairs (limited only by the MUSH<br/>configuration, which is generally 100).  The original object-attribute<br/>pair is NOT wiped out. Also, even if one copy fails (you specified a<br/>non-existent object, or one that you don't control, etc.), the game<br/>continues to try to finish copying to the other object-attribute pairs.<br/><br/>MudCore provides two alternatives: +cpattr and +mvattr.<br/>"+cpattr &lt;obj&gt;/&lt;attr&gt; = &lt;obj1&gt;/&lt;attr1&gt; &lt;obj2&gt;/&lt;attr2&gt; &lt;etc.&gt;" is<br/>more or less identical to the 1.50 @cpattr save in syntax.<br/><br/>There are two forms of the +mvattr command, one which moves one<br/>attribute on an object, to another, and one which is used to move from<br/>one object, mass groups of attributes which match a certain wildcard<br/>pattern, to another object, keeping the attribute names the same:<br/>"+mvattr &lt;obj1&gt;/&lt;attr1&gt; = &lt;obj2&gt;/&lt;attr2&gt;" does the first, and<br/>"+mvattr &lt;obj1&gt;/&lt;wildcard pattern&gt; = &lt;obj2&gt;" does the second.<br/><br/> <br/>1.5	Do it!<br/> <br/>Issue the following commands:<br/>@desc me=&lt;description&gt;<br/>@lock me=me<br/>@adesc me=@pemit %N=&lt;Your name&gt; smiles and returns your glance.<br/>@fail me=&lt;message to show when someone tries to pick you up&gt;<br/>@sex me=&lt;male or female&gt;<br/>@set me=enter_ok<br/> <br/>You are now described, safe from robbery, and have a proper gender.<br/>The adesc also allows you to see who is looking at you. (Don't worry<br/>about the %N; it will be explained later). Also, since you are set<br/>ENTER_OK, people can give you objects and money. One additional command<br/>you may wish to issue is "@lock/enter me=me", which prevents people<br/>from entering you.<br/><br/><br/>1.6     A parser discussion<br/><br/>If you are completely new to MUSH, you may wish to skip this section<br/>and come back to it later. Also, if you're programming 1.50 or 2.0<br/>exclusively, you do not need to read this section, which explains<br/>parser and game output differences between 1.50 and 2.0.<br/><br/>The command parsers for 2.0 and 1.50 are no longer significantly<br/>different. Nested brackets, evaluation of the S() and U() functions,<br/>and evaluation order should now be consistent.<br/><br/>There are some differences in messages between 1.50 and 2.0,<br/>particularly in the building commands. Some of the more obvious ones:<br/><br/>@create:<br/>  1.50   Created: Object &lt;number&gt;.<br/>  2.0    &lt;Object&gt; created as object &lt;number&gt;<br/>@clone:<br/>  1.50   Cloned: Object &lt;number&gt;.<br/>  2.0    &lt;Object&gt; cloned, new copy is object &lt;number&gt;.<br/>@destroy:<br/>  1.50   Halted.<br/>         You get your 10 pennies deposit back for &lt;object&gt;.<br/>         Destroyed.<br/>  2.0    You get your 10 pennies deposit back for &lt;object&gt;.<br/>         Destroyed.<br/>         &lt;Object&gt; has left.<br/><br/>Errors in syntax are handled differently by the two parsers. Neither<br/>parser reacts well to missing curly braces, brackets, and<br/>parentheses. 2.0 in particular will often produce extremely garbled<br/>output if matching is not correctly done; if you are getting output<br/>from a 2.0 expression that begins with a large number of spaces and<br/>ends with a group of right braces, brackets, or parentheses, you<br/>almost certainly have a mismatch.  By contrast, 1.50 will generally<br/>return the string up the point of the mismatch. This difference in<br/>error handling should be noted by those attempting to debug code under<br/>two different versions.<br/><br/>These differences, and some other minor cosmetic ones, will be<br/>encountered frequently in the text of this manual. If you are using<br/>1.50, please do not be alarmed at them.<br/><br/> <br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/> <br/>2. Objects<br/> <br/>Objects, for the purposes of this discussion, are anything which are<br/>not rooms or exits. Players are very special kinds of objects, which<br/>have rules and restrictions in addition to those normally imposed on<br/>objects. Players cannot create other players (save for the wizard-only<br/>@pcreate command, discussed later).<br/><br/> <br/>2.1	Basic object commands: @create, @destroy, @force, and @name<br/> <br/>The syntax for object creation is "@create &lt;object name&gt;=&lt;cost&gt;".<br/>If you do not specify a cost, the default is 10 marks. If you have enough<br/>money, the MUSH will respond "&lt;Name&gt; created as object &lt;#dbref&gt;" and the <br/>object will be placed in your inventory. You may refer to an object either <br/>by its name, or by its object number. The MUSH parser performs name matching,<br/>so after you create a Blue Tunic, for example, you can refer to it simply as<br/>"Blue," unless you have a Blue fire-lizard with you. In that case, you<br/>could use "Blue T" instead, or "Tunic."<br/><br/>You can change the name of an object with "@name &lt;old name&gt;=&lt;new name&gt;".<br/>(This applies to things, exits, and rooms, not just things). Your name<br/>can be changed by "@name me=&lt;new name&gt;" (1.50 requires, for player<br/>name changes, "@name me=&lt;new name&gt; &lt;password&gt;").<br/> <br/>The syntax for object destruction is "@destroy &lt;objectname&gt;".<br/>@destroy may be abbreviated to @dest. In general, you may only destroy<br/>objects that you own. It is important that you destroy objects once<br/>you no longer need them, or they will clutter the database. MUDs have<br/>a history of going down due to database bloat, so it is important to<br/>try to conserve space. You will also get back whatever amount of money<br/>it cost you to create the object.<br/><br/>If you want anyone to be able to destroy your object, you should set<br/>it DESTROY_OK. This is useful for objects which are meant to be<br/>temporary, such as messages.<br/><br/>If you want to avoid accidental destruction of an object, you should<br/>set the object SAFE. This flag prevents the @destroy command from<br/>being used on the object; instead, you must use @destroy/override<br/>(@nuke). This overrides any protections on the objects, which include<br/>the SAFE flag, wizard ability to destroy objects they don't own, and<br/>wizard ability to destroy players.<br/> <br/>You can make an object do something by using "@force &lt;object&gt;=&lt;action&gt;"<br/>or "&lt;dbref&gt; &lt;action&gt;". The object behaves as if it had typed the<br/>command. There are some restrictions on this, involving the INHERIT flag,<br/>which will be explained later. Note that since the semi-colon character<br/>is used to delimit commands, use of it in a @force will be considered<br/>to separate different commands you want to force the object to do; if<br/>this is not what you desire, you must surround the string with { braces }.<br/><br/>If you want someone else to be able to see the programming on one of<br/>your objects, set it VISUAL. The other person can then "examine" it.<br/>  <br/>=======================================<br/>[ Example 2.1: Basic object commands ]<br/>&gt; @create Test Object<br/>Test Object created as object #8032<br/>&gt; i<br/>You are carrying:<br/>Test Object(#8032)<br/>You have 168 Marks.<br/>&gt; drop test<br/>Test Object has left.<br/>Dropped.<br/>&gt; @force test=:bounces.<br/>Test Object bounces.<br/>&gt; #8032 :rattles.<br/>Test Object rattles.<br/>&gt; @set test=destroy_ok<br/>Set.<br/>&gt; @destroy #8032<br/>You get your 10 Mark deposit back for Test Object.<br/>Destroyed.<br/>Test Object has left.<br/>=======================================<br/> <br/><br/>2.2	Puppets<br/> <br/>Puppets are special objects which can hear and behave almost like<br/>normal players. They are under the control of a player, and relay back<br/>everything they see and do to that player.<br/><br/>Objects that have the KEY flag set cannot be picked up by puppets.<br/>Exits set KEY cannot be used by puppets. In fact, more precisely,<br/>puppets are treated as if they cannot pass any @locks that might be<br/>set on those objects. This forces players to solve puzzles themselves,<br/>instead of having their puppets do all the dirty work. In 1.50, the<br/>KEY flag also causes objects to go home when the person carrying them<br/>goes home or teleports.<br/> <br/>=======================<br/>[ Example 2.2: Puppet ]<br/>&gt; @create Test Puppet<br/>Test Puppet created as object #8051<br/>&gt; @set test=puppet<br/>Test Puppet grows ears and can now hear.

[2.2: "is no longer listening"]<br/>Cleared.<br/>=======================<br/> <br/>The puppet echoes back almost everything it hears. Note that when the<br/>puppet is in the same room as its owner, it does not echo back the<br/>output of commands like :. This feature prevents the puppet's owner<br/>from getting a lot of annoying echoed messages.<br/><br/>Puppets and other objects that listen trigger the adescs of objects<br/>that they enter, either via teleport, or via enter. This is because<br/>they are considered to "look" at the object when they enter it.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>Somewhat related to the PUPPET flag is the ROBOT flag. The ROBOT flag<br/>cannot be set like other flags are; instead, you must use the "@robot"<br/>command to create a robot. Something created via this command is a<br/>cross between a player and a thing. Like a player, it may be connected<br/>to and moved about independently. Like a thing, it owns no objects,<br/>and belongs to the player who created it. It is "officially"<br/>considered of type PLAYER.  Things which are set ROBOT cannot be<br/>picked up by robots; exits which are set ROBOT cannot be gone through<br/>by robots. This behavior is similar to KEY for puppets.<br/><br/>The robot flag is useful if you are running a "real" robot (an<br/>external C or LISP construct), which needs to be a player, but still<br/>needs to be under your control. Also, a robot can use the OUTPUTSUFFIX<br/>and OUTPUTPREFIX commands, which many robot programs require.<br/><br/>When you are not connected to the robot as a player, you can use it<br/>much like you would use a thing; for example, a robot may be set<br/>PUPPET.  Creating a robot (via "@robot &lt;name&gt;=&lt;password&gt;") isn't<br/>cheap, though; it will, on most MUSHes, cost you 1000 pennies. Once<br/>created, it isn't possible to get rid of the robot without asking a<br/>wizard to destroy it.<br/><br/> <br/>2.3	A Note about Privacy: @sweep<br/> <br/>Occasionally, conversations of a private nature occur on MUDs. From<br/>time to time, the presence of a puppet is forgotten. The @sweep command<br/>shows everyone and everything in that room which is listening. Something<br/>is considered to be listening if it is: a connected player, a puppet, an<br/>object with a @listen attribute, an object with ^-listen patterns (explained<br/>later), an AUDIBLE object or exit, or an object which has a user-defined <br/>command on it. The latter will be explained later.<br/><br/>@sweep in 1.50 and 2.0 are significantly different, and so are<br/>discussed here separately.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>2.0 @sweep will show the following types and output:<br/><br/>Connected players. [player connected]<br/>Disconnected players. [player]<br/>Puppets belonging to connected players. [puppet(Owner name) connected]<br/>Puppets belonging to disconnected players. [puppet(Owner name)]<br/>Objects with a @listen or ^-pattern set. [messages]<br/>Objects with $commands set. [commands]<br/>Audible exits. [audible]<br/>Audible objects, if you are in the object. [audible]<br/>Parent objects. [parent]<br/><br/>This type of sweep, the default, checks both your location and<br/>your inventory for listeners. There are also several switches for doing<br/>more specific sweeps. Note that specific sweeps only warn you about one<br/>form of listening - the form you are specifically sweeping for.<br/>You may, however, combine several switches to make a @sweep of whatever<br/>level of specificity you wish.<br/><br/>@sweep/commands lists only objects which have $commands set -<br/>"[commands]" in the generic @sweep.<br/><br/>@sweep/listeners lists only objects which have a @listen set -<br/>"[messages]" in the generic @sweep.<br/><br/>@sweep/exits checks for AUDIBLE exits in the room.<br/><br/>@sweep/players lists only players and puppets. It does not tell you<br/>if a player or puppet's owner is connected, although it does tell you the<br/>owner of a puppets.<br/><br/>@sweep/connected lists only connected players and puppets belonging<br/>to connected players. It tells you who owns the puppets.<br/><br/>@sweep/here checks your location but not your inventory. Its reverse,<br/>@sweep/inventory, checks your inventory but not your location.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>1.50 @sweep will show the following types and output:<br/><br/>Connected players.                          [speech]. (connected)<br/>Disconnected players.                       [speech].<br/>Puppets belonging to connected players.     [speech].<br/>Puppets belonging to disconnected players.  [speech].<br/>Objects with a @listen or ^pattern set.     [speech].<br/>Objects with $commands set.                 [commands].<br/>Rooms with a @listen or ^pattern set.       (this room) [speech].<br/>Rooms with $commands set.                   (this room) [commands].<br/>AUDIBLE exits, if the room is AUDIBLE.      [broadcasting].<br/>AUDIBLE objects, if you are in it.          (this room) [broadcasting].  <br/><br/>1.50 "@sweep connected" will show the following types and output:<br/><br/>Connected players.                          is listening.<br/>Puppets belonging to connected players.     [owner: &lt;owner&gt;] is listening.<br/><br/>Both types of 1.50 @sweep check both location and inventory.<br/>1.50 will take the command switches "connected", "here", "inventory",<br/>and "exits", but not in combination.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>MudCore provides a command called +awake, which is a much more paranoid<br/>version of @sweep; it allows you to discover not just objects which are,<br/>in actuality, listening, but objects which might be listening. It follows<br/>chains of message forwarding through AUDIBLE exits and @forwardlists,<br/>as well as objects in the inventory of other objects set with @listen "*";<br/>it thus allows you to discover just not what in the room might be<br/>broadcasting, but where it's broadcasting to. The command displays<br/>information in a tabular format, noting the Connected status of the<br/>owners of the objects.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>Puppets on MUSHes may be set DARK, but that flag has no effect on<br/>them, just as it has no effect on a normal player. However, wizards and<br/>wizard objects may be set DARK, and will disappear from the list of the<br/>room's contents, although they still appear on a @sweep. As a further<br/>caution, wizards who are set DARK also do not appear on the WHO list of<br/>connected players. (The rationale for allowing wizards to do this is<br/>explained in the last section of the manual).<br/><br/>Doing a @sweep several times throughout a private conversation is<br/>strongly encouraged. Remember that you are not ever guaranteed privacy<br/>on a MUD.<br/><br/> <br/>2.4	Attributes on Objects: Action Lists<br/> <br/>The @asucc, @afail, and @adrop attributes are frequently used on<br/>objects. Any command normally available to the object may be used in an<br/>action list. Object may also re-program themselves, by enclosing the <br/>commands which are to be deferred in curly brackets (braces), { }.<br/><br/>==========================<br/>[ Example 2.4: Bubbly Pie]<br/>&gt; @create Bubbly Pie<br/>Bubbly Pie created as object #1308<br/>&gt; @adrop pie = @adrop me={:splatters on the floor.;@destroy me};:lands on<br/>  the floor. If it's dropped again, it'll splatter.<br/>Set.<br/>&gt; drop pie<br/>Bubbly Pie has left.<br/>Dropped.<br/>Bubbly Pie lands on the floor. If it's dropped again, it'll splatter.<br/>&gt; get pie<br/>Bubbly Pie has left.<br/>Taken.<br/>&gt; drop pie<br/>Bubbly Pie has left.<br/>Dropped.<br/>Bubbly Pie splatters on the floor.<br/>You get your 10 Mark deposit back for Bubbly Pie.<br/>Bubbly Pie has left.<br/>==========================<br/> <br/> <br/>2.5  Machines: @cost, @pay, and @clone<br/> <br/>Machines use up money as they run. Normally, the cost is 1/64 of a<br/>Mark per command, plus the normal cost of the command. For example, if a<br/>machine @creates something, the cost is 10 and 1/64 marks. In general, the<br/>cost of running a machine is insignificant, but an object which is in an<br/>infinite loop can quickly become extremely costly. <br/> <br/>Many MUSHes have vending machines. These exist to provide some color<br/>to the world, as well as to net the owner some money. It is generally<br/>considered impolite to have set the cost of a vending machine to anything<br/>far above what it costs to run the machine.<br/><br/>The @cost attribute is an integer, which is the amount of money a<br/>machine must be given before it executes its "pay" programming. The @pay,<br/>@opay, and @apay attributes are used to program vending machines.<br/><br/>The syntax of the commands is standard: "@&lt;command&gt; &lt;object&gt;=&lt;whatever&gt;"<br/>and the attributes are triggered by the payment. The MUSH automatically <br/>gives change to people who give a machine too much money, and rebukes those<br/>who are too stingy, so you don't have to make sure that people are giving<br/>your machine that correct amount of money.<br/><br/>Many vending machines produce objects. This is generally done by<br/>having a copy of the object inside the machine, and then having the<br/>machine clone the object. The syntax of that command is @clone &lt;object&gt;.<br/>The object can be referred to either by name or number. @clone places the<br/>newly created object in the room (or, in 2.0, if the /inventory switch is<br/>given, in the object's inventory). The object is identical in all ways, save<br/>for a different object number.<br/><br/>Clone-type vending machines should be set OPAQUE. This flag, when set<br/>on something, prevents others from seeing what an object is carrying. Also,<br/>objects given by a vending machine should be set DESTROY_OK so that people<br/>can destroy them when they're done with them.<br/><br/>To @destroy an object you do not own, it must be DESTROY_OK and you<br/>must be carrying it; if you @destroy such an object, you will receive<br/>the message, "Destroyed.  &lt;Owner&gt;'s &lt;Object&gt;(&lt;#dbref&gt;)". In 2.0,<br/>the owner will be told, "You get your 10 Mark deposit back for &lt;Object&gt;."<br/>In 1.50, the owner is given that message, and gets the additional <br/>notification, "Destroyed. &lt;ObjectName&gt;(&lt;#dbref&gt;) by &lt;Player&gt;."<br/><br/>If you don't want to see annoying "You get your 10 Mark deposit back<br/>for &lt;whatever&gt;." messages every time someone destroys one of your<br/>objects, set the object QUIET.<br/> <br/>===================================<br/>[ Example 2.5:  Bubbly Pie Vendor ]<br/>&gt; @create Hot Pie<br/>Hot Pie created as object #8301<br/>&gt; @create Bubbly Pie Vendor<br/>Bubbly Pie Vendor created as object #8302<br/>&gt; i<br/>You are carrying:<br/>Bubbly Pie Vendor(#8302)<br/>Hot Pie(#8301)<br/>You have 158 Marks.<br/>&gt; @set #8301=destroy_ok<br/>Set.<br/>&gt; @succ #8301=You gobble down the hot bubbly pie.<br/>Set.<br/>&gt; @asucc #8301=@destroy me<br/>Set.<br/>&gt; @cost vendor=11<br/>Set.<br/>&gt; @pay vendor=The bubbly pie vendor sets down a hot, steaming pie.<br/>Set.<br/>&gt; @apay vendor=@clone #8301<br/>Set.<br/>&gt; @tel #8301=#8302<br/>Hot Pie has left.<br/>&gt; @set vendor=opaque<br/>Set.<br/>&gt; drop vendor<br/>Bubbly Pie Vendor has left.<br/>Dropped.<br/>&gt; give vendor=11<br/>You paid 11 Marks<br/>The bubbly pie vendor sets down a hot, steaming pie.<br/>&gt; get hot pie<br/>Hot Pie has left.<br/>You gobble down the hot bubbly pie.<br/>You get your 10 Mark deposit back for Hot Pie.<br/>Hot Pie has left.<br/>===================================<br/> <br/><br/>Database size is frequently an issue on MUSHes. One way of <br/>preventing the dreaded "database bloat" syndrome is to avoid using<br/>@clone whenever possible. MUSH provides for object "inheritance" via<br/>"parenting".<br/><br/>An object becomes parented via "@parent &lt;child&gt;=&lt;parent&gt;", where<br/>&lt;child&gt; and &lt;parent&gt; are of any type (and can be of different types).<br/>A child object inherits all attributes of the parent, unless it<br/>already has an attribute of that name, in which case the attribute on<br/>the child "blocks" that of the parent. While no object is allowed to<br/>have more than one parent, multiple levels of parents are allowed,<br/>with the "ancestors" passing their traits down to the child.<br/><br/>In 2.0, objects also inherit any exits that their parents might have;<br/>these show up on the "Obvious Exits" list. In neither version of MUSH<br/>do objects inherit the locks or flags of the parent. Certain special<br/>attributes, like @startup, are also not inherited.<br/><br/>Because in almost every regard, the child is identical to the parent,<br/>cloning becomes almost unnecessary; instead of using @clone, @create<br/>an object of the same name, set the flags and lock to be identical,<br/>and then @parent the 'clone' to the original object, so all attributes<br/>are 'inherited'. There is a convenient shortcut command in 2.0 which<br/>does all of this: "@clone/parent &lt;parent&gt;".  This saves a large amount<br/>of database space and also makes it very easy to maintain updates of<br/>objects that you are making available for public consumption.<br/><br/>It is safe to allow someone to @chown an object after it is @parented;<br/>the child does not inherit any special kind of control powers over the<br/>parent. The child can, however, still inherits attributes off the<br/>parent object, even if the owners of the child and parent are<br/>different.<br/><br/><br/>2.6  Limiting object uses:  @charges and @runout<br/> <br/>An object may be given charges, limiting its number of uses. Each<br/>success on the object uses one charge. To set the number of charges on an<br/>object, use: "@charges &lt;object&gt;=&lt;integer&gt;".<br/><br/>When the charges on an object are exhausted, its @runout action list<br/>is executed. The syntax is "@runout &lt;object&gt;=&lt;action list&gt;". The<br/>action list is in the same form as the action lists used in asucc,<br/>adrop, etc.<br/><br/>Any use of an action-attribute, such as @adrop, @asucc, @afail, @ause,<br/>or @ahear, will constitute use of a charge. @trigger also uses up a<br/>charge, although no other MUSH commands do. "@verb" triggered on<br/>something uses up charges, if an @a-action is specified (see the<br/>section on @verb later in the manual; basically, this command defines<br/>@attr/@oattr/@aattr-like triplets).  Note that an object runs out when<br/>the number of charges is equal to 0. In other words, an object with<br/>@charges 2 can be used 3 times before it executes the @runout (the<br/>@runout is executed immediately after the third use of the object).<br/> <br/>============================<br/>[ Example 2.6: Mug of Klah ]<br/>&gt; @create Mug of Klah<br/>Mug of Klah created as object #135<br/>&gt; @asucc mug=@pemit %N=You drink some of the klah.<br/>Set.<br/>&gt; @charges mug=2<br/>Set.<br/>&gt; @runout mug=:is now empty.; @name me=Empty Mug; :shatters.; @destroy me<br/>Set.<br/>&gt; drop mug<br/>Mug of Klah has left.<br/>Dropped.<br/>&gt; get mug<br/>Mug of Klah has left.<br/>Taken.<br/>You drink some of the klah.<br/>&gt; drop mug<br/>Mug of Klah has left.<br/>Dropped.<br/>&gt; get mug<br/>Mug of Klah has left.<br/>Taken.<br/>You drink some of the klah.<br/>&gt; drop mug<br/>Mug of Klah has left.<br/>Dropped.<br/>&gt; get mug<br/>Mug of Klah has left.<br/>Taken.<br/>You drink some of the klah.<br/>Mug of Klah is now empty.<br/>Empty Mug shatters.<br/>You get your 10 Mark deposit back for Empty Mug.<br/>Empty Mug has left.<br/>============================<br/> <br/> <br/>2.7     Reacting to the Environment: @listen and @ahear<br/> <br/>These two attributes allow machines to respond to things they hear,<br/>including speech, poses, @emits, and whispers. The attributes are<br/>extremely useful for programming machines that sit idle until they<br/>hear the string "has arrived," or similar things.<br/><br/>The "listen" string usually contains one or more wildcard characters,<br/>so that a single pattern of words can be listened for out of what may<br/>be an extremely complex string. For example, an object whose "listen"<br/>is set to "*smiles *" will match any occurrence of "smiles" followed<br/>by a space, such as "Elisa smiles happily."<br/><br/>The "ahear" is the action list taken when the object's "listen" string<br/>is matched. Ahear's general format is similar to asucc, adrop, etc.  There<br/>are also two refinements of ahear: amhear and aahear. Amhear only responds<br/>to strings that are generated by the object itself; ahear only responds to<br/>strings that are not generated by the object itself. Amhear plus ahear<br/>equals aahear, which allows the object to respond to anything it hears.<br/> <br/>===================================<br/>[ Example 2.7: Autogreet ]<br/>&gt; @listen me=* has arrived.<br/>Elsa - Set.<br/>&gt; @ahear me=:waves to %N.<br/>Elsa - Set.<br/>[ This forces Elsa to automatically wave to something entering the room. ]<br/>Abakin has arrived.<br/>Elsa waves to Abakin.<br/>===================================<br/><br/>Autogreets are somewhat annoying and are probably best used merely<br/>as programming examples.<br/><br/>One particularly costly loop is to have an object with a @listen of<br/>"*" and an @ahear which triggers on some particular pattern of words,<br/>sitting in a noisy room where the @ahear is evaluated several times a<br/>minute.  This will cause your money supply to drop rapidly, although<br/>it is unlikely that you will notice the loop until your money is<br/>gone. It is noted here in hopes that you will avoid making this<br/>mistake.<br/><br/>MUSH allows an additional way for objects to listen. Attributes can be<br/>scanned for ^ listen patterns (in 1.50, this only happens if no<br/>@listen is set on an object). These pattern triggers are in the format<br/>"^&lt;pattern&gt;:&lt;action&gt;". They function like a @listen/@ahear<br/>combination.  Unlike @listen, messages which match the pattern do not<br/>"go through" to the objects that the object is carrying. In order to<br/>activate patterns on the object, though, it must be set LISTENER (in<br/>1.50) or MONITOR (in 2.0).  Also, the object which is the origin of<br/>the message must be able to pass the use lock of the object with the<br/>^-pattern.<br/><br/>===================================<br/>[ Example 2.8: Echo device ]<br/>&gt; @create Echo<br/>Created: Object #4570.<br/>&gt; drop echo<br/>Dropped.<br/>&gt; @va echo=^* says, "*":@emit You hear an echo... %1 %1 %1...<br/>[ The first * matches %0, the second * matches %1. This is the "stack",<br/>  described in more detail later. ]<br/>Echo - Set.<br/>&gt; "Testing.<br/>You say, "Testing."<br/>You hear an echo... Testing. Testing. Testing....<br/>===================================<br/><br/> <br/>2.8      Keeping your objects safe<br/><br/>Unless you enjoy having your stuff stolen, or are planning on giving<br/>something away, it is usually a good idea to @lock the things you own.<br/>"@lock &lt;object&gt;=me" will prevent anyone other than yourself from<br/>picking up an object. Do note that it's usually rude to pick things<br/>up without permission from the owner.<br/><br/>Locks are useful on more than just objects - they are often used on<br/>exits. For example, you might want to lock the entrance to your<br/>bedroom to yourself only. In general, successfully passing a lock -<br/>going through an exit, picking up an object, etc. - will trigger the<br/>@succ attributes. Failing to pass a lock will trigger the @fail<br/>attributes.<br/><br/>The generic syntax is "@lock &lt;object&gt;=&lt;key&gt;". The object and key can<br/>be name, number, "me" or "here". If the key is a player, you must<br/>prefix the player name with a * - i.e. "@lock object=*Malachite".  In<br/>general, if you want something to be locked against everything, lock<br/>it to #0.<br/><br/>To unlock an object, simply use @unlock &lt;object&gt;.<br/><br/>Boolean expressions are allowed in locks, as are parentheses for<br/>grouping.  A lock of 'obj1&amp;obj2' means that the thing trying to pass<br/>the lock must be BOTH obj1 and obj2. A lock of 'obj1|obj2' means that<br/>the thing trying to pass the lock must be EITHER obj1 or obj2. Make<br/>sure that you don't confuse these.  There is also a negation operator,<br/>'!'.  '!obj1' means that the thing trying to pass the lock must NOT be<br/>obj1.<br/><br/>Carry locks allow you to check if a player is carrying a certain<br/>object. @lock &lt;object&gt;=+&lt;key&gt; only allows someone carrying &lt;key&gt; to pass the<br/>lock. Is locks allow passage only if you are the key: @lock &lt;object&gt;==&lt;key&gt;.<br/><br/>The normal @lock &lt;object&gt;=&lt;key&gt; allows passage either if you carry<br/>the key, or you are the key; thus, a carry lock plus an is lock equals a<br/>normal lock.<br/><br/>Indirect locks allow you to lock an object to the key of another<br/>object, thus creating "standard" locks. The syntax is @lock &lt;object&gt;=@&lt;key&gt;<br/>For example, if the &lt;key&gt; is locked to obj1|obj2, then &lt;object&gt; will also<br/>be locked to obj1|obj2.<br/><br/>Ownership locks allow you to lock to all objects with the same<br/>owner. @lock &lt;object&gt;=+&lt;key&gt; only allows someone with the same owner as<br/>&lt;key&gt; to pass the lock.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>         You can lock things to attributes. For example, to make a door which<br/>only allows females past, @lock door=sex:f*  Wild cards, greater than, and<br/>less than signs may be used. The latter two refer to alphabetical order:<br/>@lock door=name:&lt;m  will set the door passable to only those people whose<br/>names begin with a through l.<br/>         One special variant of the attribute lock is the evaluation lock.<br/>It evaluates an attribute, and compares it to a given value; if they are<br/>the same, then the object passes the lock. The attribute is evaluated as<br/>a U() function (see the discussion of user-defined functions later in<br/>this manual for details). The syntax is @lock object=&lt;attribute&gt;/&lt;value&gt;<br/>The person attempting to pass the lock is passed as the enactor to the<br/>attribute U-function. Evaluation locks are an advanced programming technique;<br/>don't worry if you don't understand them.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>2.0 provides a wide variety of locks; in additional to the "basic" lock,<br/>there are enter, leave, use, page, give, receive, telout, tport, and<br/>link locks. They are set using @lock/&lt;lock name&gt; and @unlock/&lt;lock name&gt;.<br/><br/>An enter lock prevents someone from entering an object unless<br/>he passes the lock. The object must also be ENTER_OK or owned by the<br/>person trying to enter it.<br/><br/>Leave, give, and receive locks are obvious: they control who<br/>is allowed to leave the object, who is allowed to give the object, and<br/>who is allowed to give things to the object, respectively.<br/><br/>A use lock prevents someone from "use"ing, performing $commands,<br/>or triggering ^-listen patterns on an object unless they pass the lock.<br/>This provides another form of security on objects; to prevent someone from <br/>abusing the $commands on your personal objects, all you need to do is to<br/>@lock/use it to "me", so you are the only person who can use the object. <br/>Please note that if you uselock yourself, you cannot be given money (since <br/>that could potentially trigger the @apay attribute on you).<br/><br/>A page lock prevents someone unless they pass the lock. It does<br/>not prevents their objects from paging you; to achieve this affect, you<br/>need to use the ownership lock primitive ($). If you want to prevent someone <br/>and all their objects from paging you, use "@lock/page me=!$*playername"  -- <br/>i.e., if Ambar wants to prevent Joarm and his objects from paging her, she <br/>types "@lock/page me=!$*Joarm". The '!' signifies negation, the '$' signifies <br/>ownership, and the '*Joarm' forces the game to parse the name as a player <br/>name. Thus the lock reads "not objects owned by player Joarm". In 2.0, this <br/>also prevents Joarm and his objects from @pemit'ing to Ambar; in 1.50, the <br/>HAVEN flag is required to stop @pemits).<br/><br/>A link lock controls who may link to a LINK_OK location (for<br/>linking exits or setting drop-tos for rooms) or an ABODE location (for <br/>setting the homes of players or things).<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>Lock types in 1.50 are somewhat more limited. Enter locks and use<br/>locks are provided. Page locks are a subset of use locks (a use lock<br/>on a player is the page lock). Teleport locks are a subset of enter<br/>locks (an enter lock on a room is the teleport lock). They are set<br/>using the @lock/enter (@unlock/enter) and @lock/use (@unlock/use)<br/>commands. Except for the fact that they set the Enter/Teleport and<br/>Use/Page Keys instead of the regular Key field on an object, they<br/>behave like @lock/@unlock. When you examine a room, you will be shown<br/>the key "Teleport Key" instead of "Enter Key"; when you examine a<br/>player, you will be shown the key "Page Key" instead of "Use Key".<br/>1.50 will, however, recognize the /tport and /page switches, and set<br/>the appropriate lock for you.<br/><br/>In 1.50, be careful, since a page lock also acts like a use lock, <br/>on a player. If you @lock/use yourself to "me", not only will you prevent <br/>people from using $commands on you, but you will prevent people from paging <br/>you. You should, in general, avoid putting $commands on yourself. You <br/>probably also want to leave yourself page-unlocked. A page lock is useful<br/>if you don't want someone to page you but you don't want to set yourself<br/>HAVEN (and thereby block out all pages).<br/><br/>			----------<br/><br/>Changing ownership of an object:  occasionally, you may want to give<br/>a gift to someone, and let them own an object that you have created. The<br/>@chown command allows you to change ownership of something.<br/><br/>For mortal players, to change ownership of something, the original<br/>owner must set it CHOWN_OK. The player who is receiving the thing must then<br/>@chown &lt;thing&gt;=me. If the thing is an object, the receiving player must be<br/>able to pick it up. If the thing is a room or exit, the receiving player must<br/>be in the same room. Wizards can simply @chown #&lt;object&gt;=player. <br/><br/>If you own an object that you want to make sure you don't lose,<br/>set its home to yourself, using @link &lt;object&gt;=me, and then set the object<br/>STICKY. Objects set STICKY will automatically go home when dropped; thus,<br/>when the object is dropped, it will return to you.<br/><br/>			----------<br/><br/>If, somehow, you manage to lose one of your objects, the @find and<br/>@search commands can be very useful. @find &lt;string&gt; will search the database<br/>for all objects and rooms that you control whose names contain &lt;string&gt;.<br/>@find without any arguments displays all objects and rooms controlled by you.<br/>This command costs (usually) 100 pennies, since it is computationally <br/>expensive. The exact cost can be found by "@list costs" (in 2.0) or<br/>"@config" (in 1.50). The cost for "@find" is the standard cost for all<br/>computationally expensive commands on a MUSH.<br/><br/>"@find &lt;string&gt;=&lt;first dbref&gt;,&lt;last dbref&gt;" will allow you to limit the<br/>dbref range searched. This version of the command will check every object<br/>from &lt;first&gt; to &lt;last&gt;, inclusive. If you do not specify a dbref, &lt;first&gt;<br/>is assumed to be 0 and &lt;last&gt; is assumed to be the last object in the db<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>The @search command checks all rooms, objects, and exits owned by<br/>you. If used without arguments, it prints all of them out. @search can be<br/>restricted to certain classes - type (rooms, exits, objects, players),<br/>name (search for a string, like @find), and flags. @search is generally<br/>faster than @find.<br/><br/>The scope of a @search may be limited in a fashion similar to @find.<br/>The range must be the _last_ argument to @search. For example:<br/>"@search flags=p,100,500" would find all objects with the 'p' (PUPPET)<br/>flag between dbrefs #100 and #500.<br/><br/>Note that @search and @find may be more expensive on certain MUSHes,<br/>especially those that run on slower machines, or are disk-based. 2.0 MUSH<br/>code is disk-based; limited @searches (restricted by a flag, for example)<br/>may not be terribly slow, but a @find might hang the server for several<br/>minutes (and bring the wrath of the wizards down upon you).<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>To get a count of how many objects you own, use "@stats". In 2.0,<br/>"@stats" with no switches returns the total number of objects in the database.<br/>"@stats/all" returns a breakdown of types in the database. "@stats/me"<br/>returns a breakdown of what you own. 2.0 @stats breakdowns cost the same<br/>as @find, so be careful with it.<br/><br/>In 1.50, "@stats" returns a breakdown of types in the database.<br/>"@stats me" returns a breakdown of what you own. Wizards can use<br/>"@stats &lt;player&gt;" to get a breakdown of what any player owns.<br/><br/><br/>2.9    Do it!  --  falcon<br/><br/>Issue the following commands:<br/>@create &lt;falcon's name&gt;<br/>@set &lt;name&gt;=puppet<br/>@desc &lt;name&gt;=&lt;whatever it looks like&gt;<br/>@lock &lt;name&gt;=me<br/>@succ &lt;name&gt;=You call to &lt;name&gt; and &lt;he/she&gt; lands on your arm.<br/>@osucc &lt;name&gt;=calls to &lt;name&gt; and &lt;he/she&gt; lands on %p arm.<br/>@fail &lt;name&gt;=You try to pick up &lt;name&gt; but &lt;he/she&gt; bites you!<br/>@ofail &lt;name&gt;=tries to pick up &lt;name&gt; but &lt;he/she&gt; bites %o!<br/>@drop &lt;name&gt;=You allow &lt;name&gt; to fly off your arm.<br/>@odrop &lt;name&gt;=allows &lt;name&gt; to fly off %p arm.<br/>@listen &lt;name&gt;=&lt;Your name&gt; has left.<br/>@ahear &lt;name&gt;=@wait 5={:flies after &lt;Your name&gt;; @set me=!puppet;<br/>   @tel owner(me); leave; @set me=puppet}<br/>[ This last statement forces the puppet to follow you around.
