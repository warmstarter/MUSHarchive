        <br/>Coding Seminar I<br/><br/>On April 18th, the first coding seminar was offered. It was for beginners and is titled "Puppets and $ commands". Schmidt, one of the best coders on the net, was to be hosting, but was unable to attend, so Leto filled in quite expertly.<br/><br/><br/>Leto says, "Hi everyone. Seems Schmidt is having some access trouble (or<br/>     something), so I've been called in from the bullpen."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Okay... you'er going to have to bear with me on this, since I<br/>     obviously have nothing prepared. And I'm no Schmidt. :)"<br/><br/>A murmer of agreement ripples across the audience.<br/><br/>Leto says, "Okay. I believe the topic tonight was puppets and $commands."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Okay, I know that alot of the people in this room know as much<br/>     or more about this than I do... so I'll have to ask that for the<br/>     people who know what I'm talking about, to please just pipe up when<br/>     asked, or when I'm wrong :)"<br/><br/>Leto says, "As I go along, feel free to ask any questions."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Let's get started."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Now, as you all probably know, a puppet is an object that its<br/>     owner can control. Usually, a puppet is used to add some spark to RP,<br/>     and are often things like Guards, servants... that sort of thing."<br/><br/>Siobhan raises his hand.<br/><br/>Leto says, "Siobhan?"<br/><br/>Siobhan rises.. "Better make the distinction between RP puppet and the flag<br/>     of the same name.. You can control any object you own to the same<br/>     degree.. it's the feedback that changes.<br/><br/>Siobhan sits.<br/><br/>Leto says, "Well, what we'll do tonight, since we can't do much, is just<br/>     talk about making a simple puppet, and we'll put some $commands on it.<br/>     We're talking about a puppet in the traditional sense... which<br/>     hopefully you'll understand as we go along."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Now, I'm not going to attempt to make the most secure puppet,<br/>     or the most code efficient puppet. What I want to do, is to cover the<br/>     basics. We can grow on those later."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Now, first and foremost, a puppet is an object. And you make<br/>     any object with the @create command. So I'll start by @creating our<br/>     sample puppet. And remember, if yu have ANY questions... ask me. :)"<br/><br/>Leto says, "Okay, to make that puppet, I just types @create Sample Guard<br/>     Puppet."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Now, right now, that puppet is about as useful as something<br/>     like a chair object. I can get it, I can probably give it to you...<br/>     but I can't do alot more."<br/><br/>Leto says, "I'd like you all to 'ex puppet'"<br/><br/>Leto says, "I've set the visual flag on it with the @set puppet=visual'<br/>     command, so you can all look at it."<br/><br/>Sample Guard Puppet(#5338Vn)<br/>Type: Thing Flags: VISUAL NO_COMMAND<br/>Owner: Duke Leto Key: *UNLOCKED* Coins: 1<br/>Parent: *NOTHING*<br/>Zone: *NOTHING*<br/>Use Key: *UNLOCKED*<br/>Enter Key: *UNLOCKED*<br/>Powers:<br/>Warnings checked: none<br/>Created: Tue Apr 18 19:29:24 1995<br/>Last Modification: Tue Apr 18 19:29:24 1995<br/>Home: Auditorium(#2116Rnt)<br/>Location: Auditorium(#2116Rnt)<br/><br/>Leto says, "At the top, you'll see that right now, the puppet has two<br/>     commands, VISUAL and NO_COMMAND. Visual lets anyone see the code of<br/>     the object, and NO_COMMAND means that the mush won't look at the<br/>     object's code to see if it has any commands on it. In this case, we're<br/>     going to want to put some commands on it though, so we'll remove the<br/>     NO_COMMAND flag by typing '@set puppet=!no_command'"<br/><br/>Leto says, "The '!' in front of the flag name means you want to remove the<br/>     flag."<br/><br/>Leto says, "If you are making an object and parenting it to something in<br/>     the parentables room, and find it doesn't work, usually the reason is<br/>     that you haven't removed that flag. I do it all the time myself."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Okay... now that we've done that... I am going to do a couple<br/>     of other common things that you would do with any object that you own."<br/><br/>Leto says, "I'm going to lock it so only I can pick it up, by typing '@lock<br/>     puppet=me'. This is actually really important, since right now any of<br/>     you could just pick it up and run off with it. :)"<br/><br/>Leto says, "We could easily spend a whole night on the various kinds of<br/>     locks in mushcode... but we won't. If any of you have any problems or<br/>     questions about locks... you can ask me or any of the other code type<br/>     people around here just about any time."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Okay, so right now, we have a locked, visual, !no_command, very<br/>     very boring object. :)"<br/><br/>Leto says, "Now the first thing you'd do with the puppet is @describe<br/>     it... remember that people don't know what an object is except for its<br/>     name, how it looks, and how it acts... so the description is very<br/>     important."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Since I dont' know what this thing is going to be for, I'll<br/>     give it a really simple description."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Now, we can put most of the same things on a puppet that you<br/>     can put on yourself, like ADESCRIBEs, OMOVEs, etc., but I think Loki<br/>     is going to be covering that sort of thing in her seminar, so I won't<br/>     go into them."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Especially since this thing isn't even a puppet yet :)"<br/><br/>Takezo raises his hand.<br/><br/>Leto says, "Sure Takezo... go ahead"<br/><br/>Takezo says, "ex still shows no command?"<br/><br/>Sample Guard Puppet(#5338Vn)<br/>Type: Thing Flags: VISUAL NO_COMMAND<br/>Owner: Duke Leto Key: [1mDuke Leto[0m(#5POWXenACMcJ) Coins: 1<br/>Parent: *NOTHING*<br/>Zone: *NOTHING*<br/>Use Key: *UNLOCKED*<br/>Enter Key: *UNLOCKED*<br/>Powers:<br/>Warnings checked: none<br/>Created: Tue Apr 18 19:29:24 1995<br/>Last Modification: Tue Apr 18 19:40:04 1995<br/>Home: [1mAuditorium[0m(#2116Rnt)<br/>Location: [1mAuditorium[0m(#2116Rnt)<br/><br/>Loki beams:)<br/><br/>Leto says, "It seems I'm all talk and no action :) I'll take it off now :)"<br/><br/>Shibboleth pulls up a chair, and sits down<br/><br/>Leto says, "Okay... let's make this thing a real puppet."<br/><br/>Leto says, "To do this, you simple set a flag on it, called puppet. The<br/>     command to do this is '@set puppet=puppet'"<br/><br/>Sample Guard Puppet is now listening.<br/><br/>Leto says, "Okay.... I've done it. Here's what it means."<br/><br/>Leto says, "From now on, this puppet is like an extra pair of eyes and ears<br/>     for me."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Right now, it doesn't really make any difference to me... since<br/>     I'm in the same room. But if I were to leave, anything that was said<br/>     or posed in this room would be relayed to me by the puppet, prefixed<br/>     by its name."<br/><br/>Leto says, "I'll demonstrate. Once I'm gone... I want someone to say<br/>     something."<br/><br/>You step into a glass elevator and are going down....<br/><br/>Sample Guard Puppet&gt; Duke Leto has left.<br/><br/>OOC Room(#47RtF)<br/><br/>***The center of all out of character life!***<br/><br/>Helpful rooms surround you!

I also<br/>     know the name of the puppet. Sometimes you have more thanb one puppet,<br/>     so the name is pretty important. If I had 6 puppets all named "Sample<br/>     Guard Puppet", I'd get mightily confused."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Of course a puppet that just stands there is no fun at all."<br/><br/>Leto says, "An interesting puppet does things. "<br/><br/>Leto says, "Here's how you make a puppet "do your bidding". You use the<br/>     @force command."<br/><br/>Leto says, "To make the puppet dance, simply type something like this:<br/>     '@force puppet=:dances around.'"<br/><br/>Duke Leto demonstrates.<br/><br/>Sample Guard Puppet dances around.<br/><br/>Leto says, "You'll notice that by putting a colon there, the puppet acted<br/>     just like I would have if I started a line of type with a colon."<br/><br/>Leto says, "That's the key to the force command. What you're doing, in<br/>     effect, is forcing it to type whatever you put after the '=' in the<br/>     @force command."<br/><br/>Leto says, "So now, I can make the puppet talk, or pose... or even type in<br/>     other mush commands. And whatever it sees will be relayed back to me."<br/><br/>Sample Guard Puppet says, "So now I can teach the class through the<br/>     puppet.""<br/><br/>Sample Guard Puppet says, "Now, a puppet doesn't have to be in the same<br/>     room as me to do it's thing when it comes to listening, as you've<br/>     seen... but there is a slight problem when it comes to making a puppet<br/>     DO things from a distance.""<br/><br/>Leto says, "See, when I type @force &lt;whatever&gt;, the mush tries to find that<br/>     &lt;whatever&gt; in the same room that I'm in, or in my inventory. If I am<br/>     in another room, as you would often be, you have to tell the mush<br/>     where to look."<br/><br/>Leto says, "To do this, you tell the mush the exact database number for the<br/>     puppet. "<br/><br/>Huh? (Type "help" for help.)<br/><br/>Sample Guard Puppet(#5338Vp)<br/>This is my sample puppet object.<br/><br/>Leto says, "If you 'ex' the puppet, you'll see that its number is #5338...<br/>     so if I want to control the puppet from afar, I'll have to @force<br/>     #5338, instead of just typing @force puppet."<br/><br/>Leto says, "If you're like me, remembering that pesky number will be your<br/>     number one beef when it comes to puppets. :)"<br/><br/>Leto says, "So, an easy thing to do is to make a command to remember it for<br/>     you, in effect."<br/><br/>test steps out of the elevator.<br/><br/>test has arrived.<br/><br/>Leto says, "Now, I could put this command on myself, but that's not very<br/>     secure... so I'm going to make a special puppet "remote control" to do<br/>     it for me."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Okay... so following the priciples discussed earlier... I'm<br/>     going to whip up a remote control right now."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Okay, to make your remote control the puppet... you have to<br/>     give it a special flag of its own... called INHERIT"<br/><br/>Leto says, "The INHERIT command give your remote the ability to @force<br/>     YOU... which is admittedly a confusing concept."<br/><br/>Leto says, "The easy way to look at this is that you're putting a complex<br/>     command on the remote, and giving it a simple name. When you type that<br/>     simple name, you trigger the remote to make you do the complex<br/>     command... that way , you can forget about the complex command. "<br/><br/>Leto says, "That didn't make much sense, even to me... so feel free to ask<br/>     a question :)"<br/><br/>Leander says, "Do we have to @set the remote control !no_command too?"<br/><br/>Leto says, "In this case... the command we're going to put on the remove is<br/>     the '@force #5388=' that I always forget :)"<br/><br/>test says, "What are the limits on what puppets can do?"<br/><br/>Leto says, "Do you mean codewise? Or in RP terms?"<br/><br/>Leto says, "For RP terms, see 'rules puppets'"<br/><br/>test says, "in RP terms."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Okay... back to the remote. "<br/><br/>Leto says, "The remote is already set to go.... so let's add the command."<br/><br/>Leto says, "The command that we want, in english, is 'find out what leto<br/>     wants to do, then make him make the puppet do that."<br/><br/>Leto says, "In mush terms, that translates into:"<br/><br/>A drum roll is heard...<br/><br/>Leto says, "&amp;force_puppet remote=$fp *:@fo [owner(me)]=@fo #5338=%0"<br/><br/>Rudolfo yuck<br/><br/>Leto says, "Okay... let's walk through that... since it's scary looking<br/>     even to me... and I typed it :)"<br/><br/>Leto says, "The '&amp;force_puppet' is the name of the attribute that we'll be<br/>     storing the command on. An attribute is used to stare commands or data<br/>     on an object. Your description is an attribute for example, as is your<br/>     &amp;email and more."<br/><br/>Leto says, "The 'remote' is the name of the object that you're putting that<br/>     attribute on. In this case, it's the remote control, as you know."<br/><br/>Leto says, "The '$fp' is the name of the command you are making. I called<br/>     it 'fp' as a short form for 'force puppet'."<br/><br/>Leto says, "The * in the '$fp *' means that you want to get some sort of<br/>     input for the command. Let me explain."<br/><br/>Leto says, "I could make a command that doesn't require anything from me<br/>     other than me triggering it. Like a "puppet sit down" command. In that<br/>     case, I'd just have something like '$sit down', to which the puppet<br/>     would do something like ':sits down'."<br/><br/>Leto says, "By putting the '*' there, the remote will listen for<br/>     anything I type after the 'fp', allowing you to use that<br/>     input later in the command."<br/><br/>Leto says, "In this case, the remote will be listening for what you want to<br/>     force the puppet to do."<br/><br/>Leto says, "The command again, is:<br/>     &amp;force_puppet remote=$fp *:@fo [owner(me)]=@fo #5338=%0"<br/><br/>Rudolfo raises his hand.<br/><br/>Leto says, "You see right there at the end of it, is a %0. THAT is where<br/>     the input that is caught by the * is passed to the puppet."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Rudolfo?"<br/><br/>Rudolfo says, "Won't the white space you type after tf get shoved into the<br/>     rest of the -varialbles ?"<br/><br/>Rudolfo meant ...after fp...<br/><br/>Leto says, "I'm not sure I know what you mean by -variables"<br/><br/>Rudolfo says, "Sorry, forgot my formating rules. %-variables."<br/><br/>Leto says, "People are using my remote :)"<br/><br/>Leto says, "At least the code works. :)"<br/><br/>Leto says, "Okay... I'm sorry Rudolpho, I think I still don't<br/>     understand.... sorry."<br/><br/>Rudolfo says, "I'm know about the range of input variables (%0...%9), and<br/>     they've gotten me confused about how the puppet will know how many<br/>     variables to assign the input string to."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Ahhhh."<br/><br/>Rudolfo smiles.<br/><br/>Leto says, "That's a good question... though it could actually confuse<br/>     people who have never dealt with variables before."<br/><br/>Leto says, "The short story is that unless you have more than one '*', all<br/>     the stuff you type, no matter how many words, will get stuffed into<br/>     %0"<br/><br/>Rudolfo says, "I'm more used to straight C than to Unix-style commands with<br/>     a variable number of parameters."<br/><br/>Rudolfo lowers his hand.<br/><br/>Leto says, "Okay... "<br/><br/>Leto says, "Let's play with the puppet a little. I want you all to make the<br/>     puppet say things or pose things. "<br/><br/>Leto says, "Just don't make it leave the room. :)"<br/><br/>Sample Guard Puppet smiles and waits.<br/><br/>Leto says, "If you are unsure of the syntax... just 'ex' the remote."<br/><br/>Leto says, "That was good... anyone else want to try?"<br/><br/>Sample Guard Puppet bats its lashes at Loki.<br/><br/>Sample Guard Puppet does a jig.<br/><br/>Sample Guard Puppet bows and spins<br/><br/>Sample Guard Puppet says, "Leto wears pink socks"<br/><br/>Leto says, "Okay. Now that we've done that... I'm going to lock the puppet<br/>     so only I can use it. I do this by typing '@ulock puppet=me'"<br/><br/>Leto says, "Sorry, @ulock remote=me"<br/><br/>Takezo raises hand<br/><br/>Leto says, "The reason being, you generally don't want other people<br/>     slandering your socks with your own puppet. :)"<br/><br/>Leto says, "Takezo?"<br/><br/>Takezo says, "remote works by forcing you?"<br/><br/>Takezo says, "what locks on you?"<br/><br/>Leto says, "The remote forces the puppet by forcing me to force the puppet,<br/>     yes. "<br/><br/>Leto says, "You don't usually have to do that though. For other things...<br/>     you can have the remote itself do actions."<br/><br/>Takezo says, "is inherit the key to forcing you?"<br/><br/>Leto says, "Now, as to the 'what locks on you', I don't know what you mean<br/>     for sure."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Ahhh. INHERIT is the flag that allows the remote to force me,<br/>     yes."<br/><br/>Takezo says, "if remote can force you can i?"<br/><br/>Takezo nods and shuts up<br/><br/>Leto says, "No you can't, but that's a good question."<br/><br/>Leto says, "The only things that you can @force, are your own objects. The<br/>     only things that can @force YOU are yourown objects that are set<br/>     INHERIT, and wizards."<br/><br/>Takezo nods thanks<br/><br/>Leto says, "Okay. Let's do another command on the remote to show you that<br/>     you dn't need all that forcing in there to have fun :)"<br/><br/>Leto says, "Something that would be really useful on a REAL remote would be<br/>     a way to keep it from getting lost."<br/><br/>Leto says, "So let's put a command on it that will make it beep whenever I<br/>     can't find it."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Here's a simple one:"<br/><br/>Leto says, "&amp;beep remote=$beep:@emit BEEP! BEEP!"<br/><br/>Leto says, "So, what I've done is created an attribute on the object called<br/>     "beep", that has a command called "beep", and whenever I type "beep",<br/>     the remote will... well... beep :)"<br/><br/>Duke Leto demonstrates<br/><br/>BEEP! BEEP!<br/><br/>Leto says, "So you see... it's a scary looking command ... but once you<br/>     break the whole thing down into parts... it's pretty simple."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Now, let's do one other fun thing before we wrap this up."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Let's make the remote work like that item that I know you all<br/>     love... The Clapper (tm)"<br/><br/>Shibboleth says, "the clapper?"<br/><br/>Leto says, "Now, using what we've talked about so far, we could simply make<br/>     a command called "clap" that would make the remote beep... but let's<br/>     do something more tricky."<br/><br/>Leto says, "The clapper... it's a device from Ktel or Ronco or something...<br/>     it listens for someone clapping and turns tvs or lights on and off. "<br/><br/>Shibboleth says, "ahh..."<br/><br/>Shibboleth nods in understanding/<br/><br/>Leto says, "The nice thing about mushcode is that you can make objects<br/>     respond to commands, or just plain listen for things that people say<br/>     or do."<br/><br/>Leto says, "What I'm talking about is what's called a listen command."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Here's what it looks like:"<br/><br/>Leto says, "&amp;clapon remote=^*claps on.:@emit The remote goes, "BEEP BEEP!""<br/><br/>Fenring hangs from the banners and croons, "Shake your groove thing, shave<br/>     your groove thing, yeah yeah, show them how we do it now!"<br/><br/>Leto says, "That's basically like a $command... but instead of a $, you<br/>     have a ^, which means that the remote is going to listen for something<br/>     that someone says or does instead of a command that someone types."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Now, if I do this: "<br/><br/>Duke Leto claps on<br/><br/>Leto says, "Nothing happens :)"<br/><br/>Leto says, "Because I forgot the period :)"<br/><br/>Duke Leto claps on.<br/><br/>Leto says, "No.. that wasn't it either... hold on :)"<br/><br/>Duke Leto feels like the chemistry teacher who can't get the bunsen burner<br/>     going :)<br/><br/>Loki grins.<br/><br/>Leto says, "Ahhh."<br/><br/>Duke Leto claps on<br/><br/>Duke Leto claps on.<br/><br/>The remote goes, "BEEP BEEP!"<br/><br/>Leto says, "There we go :)"<br/><br/>Shibboleth cheers<br/><br/>Loki claps on<br/><br/>Shibboleth claps on.<br/><br/>Leto says, "The problem was that I didn't tell the remote that I wanted it<br/>     to listen for things. To do that, you need ANOTHER FLAG, called<br/>     MONITOR."<br/><br/>Leto says, "I'll turn off the usage lock. Then yo ucan all clap on. :)"<br/><br/>Leto says, "Go ahead. "<br/><br/>Rudolfo covers his ears.<br/><br/>Takezo claps on.<br/><br/>The remote goes, "BEEP BEEP!"<br/><br/>Shibboleth claps on.<br/><br/>The remote goes, "BEEP BEEP!"<br/><br/>Leto says, "Funny thing was, I was about to warn you all that I had to do<br/>     that :)"<br/><br/>Loki smiles.<br/><br/>Leto says, "Okay... the only other thing I ought to say, is that the '*' in<br/>     the clapon command works a little differently from the * in the other<br/>     command."<br/><br/>Leto says, "In our previous command, the '*' passed a variable, which was<br/>     %0. In this case, it really only functioned as a wildcard, saying that<br/>     the remote should listen for &lt;anything&gt;claps on."<br/><br/>Duke Leto demonstrates:<br/><br/>Duke Leto does a back flip, combs his hair and eats a microwave burrito,<br/>     then after much pomp and circumstance, claps on.<br/><br/>The remote goes, "BEEP BEEP!"<br/><br/>Leto says, "And with that... I think I'll wrap up this seminar so Loki and<br/>     Paul will have something left to teach later in the week. "<br/><br/>Duke Leto steps out of the elevator.<br/><br/>Duke Leto has arrived.<br/><br/>Leto says, "Does anyone have any questions?"<br/><br/>Loki hmms.<br/><br/>Rudolfo raises his hand, again.<br/><br/>Loki raises her hand.<br/><br/>Shibboleth puzzles.<br/><br/>Duke Leto says, "AS you can see, puppets can be really helpful."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Rudolpho?"<br/><br/>there is a flash of lightning and the thunderclaps on.<br/><br/>The remote goes, "BEEP BEEP!"<br/><br/>Rudolfo says, "Exactly how do the wildcards in the two versions of the<br/>     command differ? Is it because of $ and ^?"<br/><br/>Leto says, "Right. The mush sees a ^ and says, This is what I am supposed<br/>     to look for to trigger the command. In that case, * is used as a<br/>     wildcard for matching purposes. "<br/><br/>Rudolfo says, "Anything triggering the command?"<br/><br/>Rudolfo says, "Excuse me, the wildcard applies specifically to the trigger<br/>     of the command?"<br/><br/>Leto says, "When it sees a $ it says, "whatever comes after the $ is the<br/>     command that people type in to trigger whatever is after the : in the<br/>     attribute, and it treats * as wildcard user input markers."<br/><br/>Rudolfo says, "Riiight..."<br/><br/>Leto says, "The wildcard in the case of the ^ applies to whatever the<br/>     remote is listening to in order to trigger whatever comes after the :"<br/>     in the same attribute."<br/><br/>Rudolfo says, "Got it, thank you very much for the lesson."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Just like we didn't need the * in the $ command, we didn't need<br/>     one in the ^ command. "<br/><br/>Leto says, "The * in the $ command allows the user to enter additional<br/>     information for the command to use. The * in the ^ command makes the<br/>     object listen to variable things... treating the * as a wildcard."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Okay... Loki?"<br/><br/>Loki says, "ok...'member when you were making the controller...you said it<br/>     was for 'security' thats why you couldnt do it on yerself.."<br/><br/>Loki doesnt get that.<br/><br/>Leto says, "Ahhh. Okay. That's a good question."<br/><br/>Loki beams:)<br/><br/>Leto says, "Now, with the remote in the middle of the room here... any of<br/>     you can type the beep command, or any command on the remote. Usually<br/>     though, the remote would be in my inventory, so nobody but me could<br/>     'get at it'."<br/><br/>Loki nods.<br/><br/>Leto says, "If the command was on me, anyone could activate it... and that<br/>     isn't a good thing."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Let me give you an example."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Back on Dune I, I was Tuek, the pseudo fremen smuggler. I used<br/>     to occasionally speak the fremen language, but I always hated typing<br/>     "speak fremen" before everything I wanted to say. So I created a<br/>     command, called '$sf *' that would take whatever I typed after 'sf'<br/>     and make me say it in fremen."<br/><br/>Leto says, "It worked great :) "<br/><br/>Leto says, "Then one day, I was roleplaying with Stilgar, the Fremen Naib,<br/>     and it just so happened, that Stilgar ALSO had a command, coded on<br/>     himself, called 'sf' that did exactly the same thing."<br/><br/>Leto says, "A coincidence... but not an unreasonable one. :)"<br/><br/>Loki nods..<br/><br/>Leto says, "So what happened was, I typed 'sf Greetings old friend', and<br/>     both Stilgar and I said, at exactly the same time, in Fremen,<br/>     "Greetings old friend"."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Then Stilgar typed something, and I said it at the same time he<br/>     did... "<br/><br/>Loki sees.<br/><br/>Leto says, "In that case.... it wasn't really a security problem... just<br/>     humourous :)"<br/><br/>Takezo raises hand<br/><br/>Leto says, "Now, if I had a command on me to make me punch someone whenever<br/>     anyone typed 'sf', and they had one on them to speak fremen... it<br/>     would have gotten ugly, fast :)"<br/><br/>Leto says, "Takezo?"<br/><br/>Takezo says, "similar problem on remote solved by use lock- what about on<br/>     you?"<br/><br/>Leto says, "Well, the idea is good in principle, but in the crazy world of<br/>     mushcode, it wouldn't work, because the @ulock of a player is used to<br/>     set page locks - so people can't page you."<br/><br/>Takezo says, "what about internal test on cmd?"<br/><br/>Leto says, "I know... it's confusing, because it's very different from what<br/>     a @ulock does on an object, but that's the way it is :)"<br/><br/>Takezo nods<br/><br/>Takezo says, "thank you."<br/><br/>Leto says, "Ahhh, so make the command check to see who the person who typed<br/>     the command was? Yes, you can do that... though generally, it's easier<br/>     to just put it on an object you carry - so you can avoid all the<br/>     @switches etc."<br/><br/>Takezo nods.<br/><br/>Leto says, "Okay... well... I'd like to thank you all for being so patient<br/>     with me as I fumbled about trying to figure out what to say. :)"<br/><br/>Takezo applauds the speaker<br/><br/>Leto says, "And if you have any other code questions, I'd urge you all to<br/>     go to the other code seminars... see events upcoming. You can also<br/>     always get help on the +code channel ,or just asking people."<br/><br/>Last Modified: Thu Mar 1 23:59:48 EST 2001<br/>Created and Maintained by: Christian Gilmore<br/>Comments and Questions: curator@fremen.org<br/><br/>Museum Arrakeen Dune II MUSH Home Page<br/>
