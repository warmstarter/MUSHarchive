<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fishing">Fishing</span></h3>
<p>Fishing requires a forceful tool (either a prybar, hatchet, knife, or hammer) and fishing tackle. There are a couple fishing tackle items scattered on the different maps, but if you don't find one you can craft it by combining a fishing line with a fishing hook. Both tackle and lines/hooks can be found by scavenging in the ice fishing huts on Mystery Lake. Each time you fish with fishing tackle it loses a little bit of condition. Eventually each tackle will wear out.
</p><p>To fish, find an ice fishing hut. They all look the same, they're small open-sided green buildings on frozen lakes. Inside each one is a number of shelves and cabinets, a wood stove, and a small hole in the ice. Click on the hole to 'open' the ice using your forceful tool. Then choose how many hours you want to fish. I average about one fish per hour, and I like to fish for 8-10 hours. If you don't have very warm clothes you'll need firewood to heat the stove while you fish.
</p><p>Fish is the least caloric efficient meat in the game. Both rabbit and deer give you more calories both by weight, and for the amount of work you have to invest in the activity to get the meat. However, fishing is useful if you don't have a hunting knife to cut open corpses.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Snaring_Rabbits">Snaring Rabbits</span></h3>
<p>To catch a rabbit requires a snare. One location on the Mystery Lake map generates with snares, but it can be hard to find. I started snaring rabbits by crafting my own snares. Snares don't show visible wear like other equipment, instead they have a chance of breaking each time you use them.
</p><p>To set up a snare you want to find a rabbit run. This is an area where you can see rabbits hopping around. They'll flee when you approach, but they'll be back later. Find a spot on the ground with a lot of little footprints, and place the snare.
</p><p>It's important that you see the rabbits hopping around at the spot where you want to place snares. 
</p><p>There are a few simple rules of thumb with snaring rabbits:
</p>
<ul>
<li> In general it takes about 12 hours after a snare is placed to catch a rabbit. This means if you time things correctly you can snare rabbits twice a day.
</li>
<li> Rabbits spawn in the early morning (dawn) so that's the best time to check snares.
</li>
<li> You can't catch more than four rabbits at a time at the same run.  I use six to seven snares per run to maximize my catch (some snares won't catch a rabbit on a particular day).
</li>
<li> If a snare is triggered (opened) you need to pick it up and place it down again or it won't catch another rabbit.
</li>
<li> If you find a spot where a snare catches a rabbit you can keep using it. Rabbits don't 'remember' where other rabbits died.
</li>
<li> Rabbits can be over-hunted. If you have trouble catching rabbits in an area that used to be successful, try moving to a different run.
</li>
<li> Always clean the corpse (take all meat, hide, guts) as an empty corpse decomposes faster than one with parts left behind. There's a limit in game to how many 'bodies' can litter the landscape at one time, and every half-harvested rabbit corpse is another rabbit you can't snare. 
</li>
<li> Snares can be damaged by high wind and bad weather. Try to find a good footprint spot sheltered by a bush or some tree trunks.
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Shooting_Deer_and_Wolves_.28Rifles.29">Shooting Deer and Wolves (Rifles)</span></h3>
<p>I've killed several deer and wolves with a rifle.
</p><p>Shooting either a deer or a wolf with a hunting rifle works in a similar way. The "best" way to do it is to aim at your target from the side, from as close as you can reasonably get. You do get a little bit of a 'zoom' effect when you use the rifle sight, which can help a lot.
</p><p>The rifle isn't very accurate, and my experiences have varied from shot to shot. Some shots I aimed a little 'above' the animal's center of mass, other times a little 'below' (I use a touchpad on a laptop and it can be hard to get perfect alignment). If you think about it though, you should try to keep the sight a little bit 'above' the center of mass, as the sight is above the barrel of the rifle. It seemed completely random to me whether I hit, and whether I killed my target in one shot.
</p><p>From investigating on the forums, the bullet itself does travel in a perfect straight line, but the range is surprisingly short. It wasn't that I was "missing" somewhat longer range shots, it was that the bullet disappeared before reaching the target. The dev team official response was that they expect players to shoot at targets from close to point blank range and this is part of the learning experience of the game.
</p><p>In addition to rifles being short range firearms, there is a system that (in effect) randomly rolls for the damage of a hit. This means with RNG extremes, you can shoot a deer in the heart and have it scamper off to survive, or also shoot it in the rump and have it keel over dead.
</p><p>For now, the 'best' time to kill a wolf seems to be to wait for it to be eating after killing a deer or rabbit. This allows you to sneak up quite close and aim at it from the side while it's feeding. If you do kill it, you can also steal its kill (you get two corpses from one bullet). This makes a "wolf eating a deer" kill worth quite a lot of meat.
</p><p>Shooting a deer can be a little harder than shooting a wolf, because deer don't seem to graze and are almost always moving. They do occasionally pause to look around, but I don't think there's a 'tell' to know when they're going to do it. What worked for me was to sneak up in a crouch and wait "catty-corner" to a deer (in a diagonal line ahead of it and to one side). I'd then pull out my rifle and line up the sight a body length or two ahead of the deer and watch it walk into the sight. Once it was lined up, I clicked off a shot. Extra deer seem to spawn around deer blinds, so a blind would be a good place to practice your rifle or bow hunting. However, due to the range issues, don't actually stand in the blind.
</p>
<ul>
<li> NOTE: If you're using a touchpad it can help to disable 'tap to click' or you'll end up wasting bullets (and scaring your target) while lining up the shot.
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you hit your target but don't kill it, you can follow the blood trail to hunt it down and finish the job.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Shooting_Deer_and_Wolves_.28Bow.29">Shooting Deer and Wolves (Bow)</span></h3>
<p>I killed two deer with a bow. Unfortunately, it took 18 arrows for me to kill them as the aiming in the game is _terrible_. Update: This was done during the period when there was no archery reticule.
</p><p>Just as with a rifle, what you want is to try to aim at your target from the side, from as close as you can reasonably get. You get a little bit of a 'zoom' effect but it doesn't help much because of the terrible aiming.
</p><p>Unlike with a rifle, you can't crouch and shoot the bow. You have to be standing. This limitation isn't representative of real archery, and appears to be added only to make archery in the game more "challenging". For rifle hunting, crouching and sneaking up to the target is an important part of getting close enough to hit it. For archery, while you *can* still crouch and sneak, the moment you stand the target sees you and begins to flee (or attack). This means you have to stand, aim, and fire with a single fluid movement.
</p><p>The way archery works is you get a first-person view of a bow with a knocked arrow. If you draw the bow for more than 2-3 seconds, you begin to 'tire' and lose your form, which results in bad aim. If you put the arrow tip over the target, it shoots wildly to one side. You have to put the arrow to the right of the target, and a some amount above it, calculating the curve of an arrow trajectory. 
</p><p>What it looks like to me is you're aiming and shooting out of your other, not dominant eye (re: ocular dominance). Because of unexplained dev design choices they they angled the bow to the right (which means you have to adjust your aim even further to compensate), and pushed the tip of the arrow about half an inch to the right of center (on my screen). They also deliberately borked the visual design so there's nothing you can see except the bow and arrow, which means there's no arrow rest or grip.
</p><p>There is a tiny white reticule dot in the center of the screen when the bow is held in the hands but not "loaded" (knocked) with an arrow. This reticule dot disappears when the player draws the bow. In order to hit a target with the bow a player needs to put the dot over their target, draw quickly, and fire. If they've snuck up to a target they have to stand, aim, draw, fire, all before the target runs away.
</p><p>For a while there was no white reticule dot which made the experience even worse than it is now. However, it's still a badly designed archery system even with the reticule restored.
</p><p>Since I use a touchpad (which is less accurate than a mouse) and mouse/aim sensitivity is buggy in the game (one of the few issues that reminds me it's alpha) aiming becomes an exercise in futility.
</p>
<ul>
<li> NOTE: If you're using a touchpad it can help to disable 'tap to click' or you'll end up wasting arrows (and scaring your target) while lining up the shot.
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you hit your target but don't kill it, you can follow the blood trail to hunt it down and finish the job.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Shooting_Bears_.28Rifles.29">Shooting Bears (Rifles)</span></h3>
<p>I haven't killed a bear. These suggestions are what I found reading the game forums. I actually try to keep myself spoiler-free on the forums for things I haven't directly done, but I did stumble across a talk about bear killing and read some suggestions.
</p><p>The consensus seems to be either (a) you're super-macho and you should kill it in honorable combat or (b) you're a wuss and you wait for a situation where you can unload a few bullets into the bear and then immediately run and hide inside an enclosed shelter and wait for it to die of blood loss.
</p><p>If you've mastered archery and can convince the bear to approach you straight on, it's possible to kill it with one arrow to the head.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Stealing_Wolf_Kills">Stealing Wolf Kills</span></h3>
<p>This is a legitimate mechanic in the game, the devs expect people to do this and it's not "cheating". How it works depends on the mode you use.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Pilgrim. Walk up to any feeding wolf. It will run away, leaving you to safely harvest the corpse.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Voyageur/Stalker. Throw a torch or flare at a feeding wolf. Be prepared with a backup weapon if it decides it's hungry enough to fight. Build a fire to keep away predators while you harvest the corpse.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Any mode. A wolf won't eat a full deer corpse. You can get less meat in safety by simply waiting for the wolf to finish feeding and walk away. You should still build a fire if you're playing in a mode with aggressive wolves.
</li>
</ul>
