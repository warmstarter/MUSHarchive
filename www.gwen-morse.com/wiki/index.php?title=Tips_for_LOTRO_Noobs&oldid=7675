<p>For now since I'm a noob this will function as a scratch pad of sorts. As I get better informed about the different systems I'll add more constructive help.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="My_Toons">My Toons</span></h2>
<p>My intent is to level up all the healing classes and see which one is most fun for me to play and more useful in raids. No matter what happens I'll likely play Eachna often as I reserve her name for my intended main toon and I find I enjoy playing the Rune Keeper class.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Eachna_of_Brandywine">Eachna of Brandywine</span></h3>
<p>Eachna is my main.
</p><p>She is an elvish Rune Keeper. Rune Keepers have two discrete magic roles, DPS and Healing. They can specialise in Fire Damage Over Time, Lightning Direct Damage and Debuff, or Heals Over Time. They can be powerful raid healers (or powerful DPS), but due to the way their powers work they're slower than other classes at each of their roles.
</p><p>Mounts: Steed of the Eastemnt, Red Clad Horse of the Gap, 2014 Yule Steed of the Winter Winds, 2015 Yule Steed of the Ithilien Winter, Prized Thorin's Halls Goat, Prized Rivendell Steed, Prized Tundra Steed, Prized Mathom Society Steed, Prized Eglan-Horse. Of these Eachna rides the Prized Eglan-Horse when she's not on her Light build spotted grey War Steed.  I named all her steeds "Hope".
</p><p>Craft: I've given her the Explorer Vocation which means she'll be harvesting raw materials for crafting. She has the forester, prospector, and tailor crafts. 
</p><p>Hobby: She has the Fishing hobby. She's caught her 50 pound salmon and earned her Lady of Streams, Darter-Master, and Sturgeon Master titles.
</p><p>Guild: She's in the Tailor's Guild as a level 105 Explorer.
</p><p>Skirmish Soldier: She's running a female elf Bannerguard named Rinitalia. I have also leveled a herbalist and sage for group play. I have no idea what the name means, I pulled it from an elf name generator.
</p><p>This is the recommended list of virtues for a Rune Keeper: Innocence, Zeal, Charity, Compassion, Fidelity.

</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gamberella_of_Brandywine">Gamberella of Brandywine</span></h3>
<p>This is a loose approximation of a gemstone name for a hobbit. I like to start my character names with the letter "G" (unless they're a variation of Eachna), and hers is "G-amber-ella", like Cinderella but with Amber. 
</p><p>Gamberella is a hobbit Minstrel. She's my second play toon, although she's been benched till Eachna reaches level 100. I realized levelling two toons at once felt like too much of a grind.
</p><p>Mounts: Steed of the Eastemnt, Red Clad Pony of the Gap, Prized Mathom Society Pony, Prized Liver Chestnut Pony, 2014 Yule Steed of the Winter Winds, 2015 Yule Steed of the Ithilien Winter, 2015 Treasure Laden Goat. Of these Gamberella rides the Prized Mathom Society Pony. I named all her steeds "Charity".
</p><p>Craft: I've given her the Tinker vocation, which means she'll be cooking, jewelry-making, and prospecting.
</p><p>Hobby: She has the Fishing hobby.
</p><p>Guild: She's in the Jeweller's Guild as a level 53 Tinker.
</p><p>Skirmish Soldier: She's running a male Man Herbalist named Wordspinner. While I tend to prefer female soldiers, I couldn't resist the visual of a big strong man chasing my tiny hobbit around to heal her. 
</p><p>This is the recommended list of virtues for a Minstrel: Valour, Zeal, Innocence, Fidelity, Tolerance.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gallali_of_Brandywine_.28n.C3.A9e_of_Elendilmir.29">Gallali of Brandywine (née of Elendilmir)</span></h3>
<p>Gallali was originally on Elendilmir, but was moved as part of the 2015 Server Consolidation. She's an elf Minstrel. Since I already have a Minstrel I suppose I'll use her to farm TP in the future or be an extra crafter or some sort of mule.
</p><p>Mounts: Steed of the Eastemnt, Red Clad Horse of the Gap, 2014 Yule Steed of the Winter Winds, 2015 Yule Steed of the Ithilien Winter.
</p><p>Craft: I've given her the Woodsman vocation, which means she'll be doing woodworking, forestry, and farming. My plan is to use her to make minstrel instruments for herself and Gamberella, as well as whatever other wooden items will be useful.
</p><p>Guild: She's in the Woodworking Guild as a level 31 Woodsman.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gealowyn_of_Brandywine">Gealowyn of Brandywine</span></h3>
<p>Gealowyn is a human female Captain. She has a Bannerman who acts like a hireling or summon and provides her with buffs. She may eventually be levelled to be a raid healer.
</p><p>Mounts: Steed of the Eastemnt, Red Clad Horse of the Gap, 2014 Yule Steed of the Winter Winds, 2015 Yule Steed of the Ithilien Winter.
</p><p>Craft: I made her a Historian. This is scholar, farmer, and weaponsmith.
</p><p>Guild: She's in the Scholar's Guild as a level 52 Historian.
</p><p>Bannerman: I am using a Shieldmaiden named "Skjaldmaer" which is Old Norse for shieldmaiden.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gwinwin_of_Brandywine">Gwinwin of Brandywine</span></h3>
<p>Gealowyn is an elf female Loremaster. She has a collection of pets she can summon for different purposes including tanking, healing, and stealth attacks.
</p><p>Craft: I've given her the Armorer vocation, which means she'll be metalworking, tailoring, and prospecting. 
</p><p>Guild: She's in the Metalworking Guild as a level 50 Armorer.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gyrvild_of_Brandywine">Gyrvild of Brandywine</span></h3>
<p>She's a Beorning. This is both her race and class. Beornings are a human-like race that shapeshift into bears. They have a larger and more muscular build than the human models.
</p><p>Mounts: Steed of the Eastemnt, Red Clad Horse of the Gap, all the mounts from Hensinger Farm. She rids the Blood Bay horse from Hensinger Farm. I wanted something very basic as I didn't feel a Beorning would ride a fancy horse with ornate tack. I named all her steeds "Cub". 
</p><p>Craft: I've given her the Armsman vocation, which means she'll be weaponsmithing, woodworking, and prospecting.
</p><p>Guild: She's in the Weaponsmith's Guild as a level 22 Weaponsmith.
</p><p>Skirmish Soldier: She's running a female hobbit Sage or Bannerguard named Mugwort. As with Gamberella's giant skirmish soldier, I couldn't resist the visual of a tiny hobbit chasing my giant Beorning around to protect her.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Classes">Classes</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Healing_In_LOTRO">Healing In LOTRO</span></h3>
<p>Minstrel are "reactive" healers. Damage comes in and the healer activates a skill to restore the missing health. Reactive healers only fix damage after it's happened (they react to specific attacks). Reactive healers tend to be very good at dealing with large damage spikes, but may have problems with maintaining enough Power to last through long fights.
</p><p>Runekeepers and Captains are "proactive" healers. Rather than waiting for damage to the target's Morale they cycle through a sequence of small Heal over Time effects that (if done properly) restores Morale in timed ticks. Proactive healers anticipate attacks before they happen. Proactive healers tend to have trouble dealing with large damage spikes, but have low-cost skills that allow them to sustain their Power pools through long fights.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Minstrels are the "easiest" healing class to play well in the game. They have the widest range of potential healing boosts/skills. If you want to see the biggest healing numbers floating by, Minstrels are perfect for you. Minstrels specialize in burst heals. 
</li>
<li> Captains are the most flexible healing class. While only rarely a main healer, they can shift between DPS/Heals/Tanking very quickly and it's normal for them to play all these roles in group play. Captains specialize in group heals-over-time that are triggered by their DPS attacks, and have a wide range of buffs that make everyone better. 
</li>
<li> Runekeepers are probably the "hardest" healing class to play well in the game, but they're very rewarding if you take the time to understand their skills. Runekeepers specialize in heals-over-time, both single-target and group effects.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The general consensus on the LOTRO forums is that all three healing classes are good at what they do (proactive burst heals, backup heals with strong DPS and bufs, reactive healing over time) and no one single class is clearly "best".
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Runekeeper">Runekeeper</span></h3>
<p>Runekeepers play as a cross between a traditional Wizard and a traditional Cleric. They have both burst damage and damage over time, and heals over time. They also have some stuns and debuffs for crowd control.
</p><p>They're a completely fabricated class. There's no analogue for them in the Middle Earth books. Once you overlook that, they can be a "fun" class. They output a lot of damage, have very good heals, and have a lot of flashy visual effects.
</p>
<ul>

</li>
</ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Attunement">Attunement</span></h4>
<p>Runekeepers use a builder/spender system based around their attunement meter. There are three types of attunement: battle, healing, and steady. Attunement is the play system that differentiates Runekeepers from the other classes.
</p><p>"Battle" attacks tend to do damage (either direct damage or damage over time) and push the meter towards combat attunement. The more the battle side of the meter is filled in, the more damage each attack does at the cost of progressively weaker heals. When attuned to battle the meter is orange.
</p><p>"Healing" effects tend to restore morale, cleanse states, or create bubbles, and push the meter towards healing attunement. The more the healing side of the meter is filled in, the more morale each effect restores at the cost of progressively weaker attacks. When attuned to healing, the meter is green.
</p><p>"Steady" effects tend to have crowd control effects, debuffs, or do small amounts of damage, and help move to the center balance point of the attunement meter. When at steady attunement the meter is empty.
</p><p>As a very general rule of thumb, a particular fight will involve either building healing _or_ combat attunement. Fights tend to be too fast to switch between the two. While a Runekeeper can easily switch roles between fights (for example, aiding in killing trash mobs with Battle attunement and then switching to Healing attunement when a Boss shows up), it's rare to switch in the same fight.
</p><p>If an emergency happens and there is a need to switch, Runekeepers have several options, including Steady skills, cash out skills, and the Steady Hands skill. 
</p><p>Steady Hands is a general skill unlocked by all Runekeepers. Using it switches the Runekeeper from one attunement to the opposite (Healing to Battle, or Battle to Healing). It doesn't work with Neutral attunement.
</p><p>All three trait lines (Red, Yellow, Blue) have special "cash out" abilities. These quickly spend all battle or healing attunement and put the attunement meter at the neutral steady point. 
</p><p>As already mentioned, using Steady effects pushes the meter towards the neutral point, which also aids in changing attunement.

</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Accessories">Accessories</span></h4>
<p>Gear Slots:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Runestones: The Runekeeper weapon. They are mostly used when smacking mobs in the head ("auto-attack"). The damage type (electric, frost, fire) doesn't matter all that much but the secondary effects on some stones are quite useful. Use crafted runestones (a jeweller can make them) as soon as you can as they're better than looted stones. Read each item carefully and decide which one you want to use.
</li>
<li> Satchels: The Runekeeper bag. This is a special equipment and cosmetic slot that only RK's have. Like other gear the bags can be enchanted. Use crafted bags as soon as you can (a tailor can make them) as they're much better than looted bags. Keep your starter bag (or store a copy in the Wardrobe) as it can be dyed to match your outfit and is good for those who prefer a sleek/minimalist look. The bags you can buy in the store can't be dyed and the bags you can get crafted are more bulky and ornate than the starter bag. There are three lines of crafted bags: one each to boost Battle, Steady, and Healing attunements. 
</li>
<li> To Color Your Satchel: The starter satchel can be dyed, and so can the crafted satchels made by Tailors. The satchels sold through the store cannot be dyed.
</li>
<li> To Hide Your Satchel: You can currently hide the satchel by equipping the first Legendary quest reward bag you get in Moria as a wardrobe item for your character. This removes the satchel cosmetically from your character. Make sure to put a copy in your shared Wardrobe so you can always have it in the future.
</li>
<li> Rifflers and Chisels: These occupy your ranged item slot and hold enchantments. You have to choose either a Riffler or a Chisel as you can't slot both items. They have a wide range of effects, so like runestones read each item carefully and decide which you want to use. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't keep these three items slotted and upgraded as you level, you're ignoring a lot of power your character could be wielding. There are no Legendary versions of rifflers or chisels but there are crafted versions every few levels right up to cap. Metalsmiths make Rifflers and Chisels.
</p><p>When leveling your Legendary gear, it's a good idea to level a Healing runestone plus satchel for group healing, and a DPS runestone plus satchel for solo play. That way if you're invited to a group where you're expected to function as a healer you're prepared for the event. If you don't want to carry two full sets of role gear then you can "make do" with one DPS and one healing item but your output for both roles will be weaker than players with two sets.
</p><p>Runekeepers can't equip a shield. Even though it's not really clear when looking at the animations, using Runestones occupies both hands.
</p><p>Consumables: I'm still taking the time to understand the various consumables.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Legendary_Accessories">Legendary Accessories</span></h4>
<p>When planning your Legendary gear, it's a good idea to level a Healing runestone plus satchel for group healing, as well as your usual DPS runestone plus satchel for solo play. That way if you're invited to a group where you're expected to function as a healer you're prepared for the event. If you don't want to carry two full sets of role gear then you can "make do" with one DPS and one healing item but your output for both roles will be weaker than players with two sets.
</p><p>For people who don't want to devote a lot of resources to healing, a pair of dedicated Third Age items would be an acceptable option.
</p><p>Note: Legendary scrolls that convert damage to a specific type (like Westernesse) only work on melee auto-attacks for Rune Keepers (which is only a fraction of RK damage). This means only the secondary effects on these scrolls are of any interest.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Healing">Healing</span></h4>
<p>Runekeepers restore Morale with heal over time effects. They have strong single target and group skills.
</p><p>Runekeepers can use bubbles to keep targets alive through spike damage, but this is not as effective as the big reactive healing skills Minstrels get.
</p><p>Runekeepers can have a little bit of a bad reputation because of their reactive heals. It's very easy to play a Runekeeper badly, while a Minstrel almost plays itself. But with a patient and skilled player, a Runekeeper can heal just as well as a Minstrel while spending a fraction of the Power.
</p><p>For those players who have played healers on Dungeons and Dragons online, the Runekeeper plays a bit like a druid.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Mentoring_Manuals">Mentoring Manuals</span></h4>

</ul>
<p>Standards are now two different things: an item you slot on your paper-doll and a skill, depending on how you put points into the trait-trees. They used to be one-in-the-same.
</p><p>As others have said, you get the ITEM in the lower levels, around 20. This goes in your "ranged" slot on your paper doll, the same slot as a Herald Armament (we used to have to choose between herald or banner, but no longer do). The item is just a passive buff, that is all. You WANT one equipped at ALL times in combat. These are made by tailors, yes, check the auction hall (or make your own!).
</p><p>Once you get ~21 points to spend in trait-trees, you can unlock a SKILL that will allow you to place a banner on the ground. This is the group-buff/AOE-attack/debuff.
</p><p>You can put up to 5 points in the banner skills. The banner is placed on top of the monster you are targeting (looks like they get skewered!) The fifth point allows you to choose where to place the banner.

<p>To get the receipt for a new bannerman skin, get a tailor to craft an old armament (any level or type will do). You can then barter the armament for the receipt, and then the receipt for a skill.
</p><p>I used up a bunch of old low level materials on my tailor to make about 20-30 armaments all of the same type, bartered for 20 receipts, and then bartered the receipts for one of each skill so I had a variety of appearances to use.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Housing_and_Storage">Housing and Storage</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Housing">Housing</span></h3>
<p>Housing in LOTRO is very nice. For about one gold you can get a small house with several decorating slots and a storage chest useable as shared storage for all characters on the account. There's a short quest chain given by the Housing Agents which provide you with some starter furniture items, as well as very inexpensive items sold by housing vendors.
</p><p>For about 7 gold you can get a large house which has a larger floor plan with an additional room and a lot more decorating slots than a small house. It also has one storage chest.
</p><p>If you take up the fishing hobby you can visit a Fishing Taxidermist to stuff any trophy fish for free. You can mount them on your wall as a nice decoration. There are a lot of items you get as loot from doing instances and raids that can be turned into decorations. Finally, you can craft decorations using recipes earned from different reputation barter NPCs in the assorted regions of Middle Earth. Every production crafter can make some sort of housing decoration.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Bree_Housing">Bree Housing</span></h4>
<p>I bought a house in the Bree homestead.
</p>
<ul>
<li> I feel the "best" Bree starter home is 1 Garden Street. It costs 1 gold as it's a small house. It's near the entrance of the housing lot, as well as being close to the center where the vendors and Vault banker are located. There's a small break in the fence that leads down to the water for fishing. I think it's a nice place to set up and get used to the way things work while trying to find the perfect large house.
</li>
<li> I think the "best" Bree deluxe home is 2 Garden Street, with 4 Long Street as a runner-up. Like 1 Garden Street they're close to both the center and the entrance. They each cost about 7 gold. Long Street is slightly further from both the center and entrance than Garden Street, but only by one row of houses. The two together would be perfect for a couple or kin-mates who want houses next to each other.
</li>
</ul>
<p>When I say "about" 1 or 7 gold, each house price includes a small silver fee for maintenance.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Storage">Storage</span></h3>
<p>There are several kinds of storage:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Bags
</li>
<li> Shared Vault
</li>
<li> House Shared Chest
</li>
</ul>
<p>Related to storage are:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Wardrobe
</li>
<li> Barter Wallet
</li>
</ul>
<p>Technically the Wardrobe and Barter wallet don't count as storage but they move items that would otherwise clog up storage slots into specialized locations.

</ul>
<p>There are several fishing titles you can earn:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Apprentice Angler - level 10.
</li>
<li> Journeyman Angler - level 50.
</li>
<li> Expert Angler - level 100.
</li>
<li> Master Angler - level 150.
</li>
<li> Lord/Lady of Streams - level 200.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Fishing Deeds By Location: 
</p>
<ul>
<li> With at least 50 Points in Fishing you can catch: Trout in the North Downs, Trollshaws, Evendim and the Lone-lands.
</li>
<li> With at least 100 Points in Fishing you can catch: Darters in Angmar, Misty Mountains and Forochel.
</li>
<li> With at least 150 Points in Fishing you can catch: Sturgeon in Enedwaith, Eregion, Mirkwood, Moria, and East Rohan.
</li>
<li> 50 pound salmon can be caught anywhere Largemouth Bass and Carp may be caught. This includes Forochel, Evendim, Eregion, Angmar, Moria and the high level zones like Rohan and Anorien.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The 50 pound salmon is the rarest fish in the game.
</p><p>All the deed fish drop in the same zone. Once you find a section of water where you catch at least one of the fish in the specific deed, you can keep fishing there to eventually catch all the fish in the same deed. 
</p><p>The completion of each deed gives a wall trophy that displays one each of the nine fish caught to complete that deed.
</p><p><b>Summer Festival Fish</b>
</p><p>Locations: the fishing holes inside Thorin's Gate, outside Bywater, outside the South Gate of Bree, and on the docks at Celondim.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Legendary_Items">Legendary Items</span></h2>
<p>Legendary items are part of the epic crafted gear system. They are the end-game "grind" items you farm, upgrade, and refine to perfection.
</p><p>You can get your first legendary weapon by completing Volume 2 book 1 of the epic quest line. When your character reaches level 45 Elrond will send you to the the walls of Moria where you do a nice little intro quest chain which will give you your first Legendary Weapon. You pick up the quest itself by talking to the dwarf at the gate in the south-eastern part of Eregion (close to Echad Dunann). It's usually suggested waiting until you are level 46 because most mobs will be red at 45. Whether you do the quest at 45 or 46, you'll want to wait until around level 50 to enter Moria as the content is much harder than Eregion.
</p><p>In order to actually enter Moria, you'll need to level your weapon to 10 by using it when killing mobs. Then go either Thorin's Hall or to the Rivendale crafting area and look for the gold rings on the right side as you enter. Talk to the Legendary Forgemaster.
</p><p>Your first legendary items are "starter" gear and you should expect to replace them with better items. Later legendary items are found as loot.
</p><p>In order to take your first weapon past 20th level, you have to finish Volume 2 Book 1. That means you have to go finish up the Watcher in the Lake. If you have not finished Volume 2 Book 1, you will not be able to advance your starter Legendary weapon past 20th level, nor will you be able to bind new Legendary weapons or items. Finishing the quest allows you entry to Moria and gets you your first Legendary class item.

</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Deconstructing_Legendary_Items">Deconstructing Legendary Items</span></h3>
<p>Legendary items that have a minimum equip level lower than 5 or so levels below level cap are grinding gear. Legendary items now cap out at 100, while the level cap is 105. If cap is 105, then items from equip level 100 are items that will be used as your best gear and should be slotted with your best relics and scrolls.
</p><p>Anything between 51 and 95 (while legendary cap is 10) is used as a form of item experience storage and rune creation. Grinding items will be broken down to create the runes and item experience tokens that will be fitted into those prime 95-100 items.
</p><p>You will typically get back a single tier 1 relic if you deconstruct an item without levelling or slotting it. The higher the level the better your chance of getting back multiple relics of tier 1-4.  The best levels to deconstruct legendary items for their relics are 2, 11, 21, 31, 41, and 51.  The best levels  to deconstruct legendary items for their xp runes are 16, 26, 36, 46, and 56. If you level a legendary to at least level 30 (or better at 31) before deconstruction, you will be able to choose one of the legacies on it to put on another item. This is done via a scroll you receive upon selection. The legacy scroll will be set to tier 1-2, not the tier it was on the item. This is done to collect a set of 'perfect' legacies for your wielded legendary items.
</p>
<ul>
<li> For items used by a different class, first determine if you can pass them to a toon of the appropriate class (an alt, a kinship member, a friend, selling through the AH). If not, then identify them and then immediately deconstruct them. You're basically removing them from the game database in exchange for a single tier 1 relic.
</li>
<li> If you're on your first toon or otherwise have no stored assets, it can be worthwhile to deconstruct your first few items at level 11 to get more basic upgrades to fit into your two starter Legendary items and to be able to experiment with the systems.
</li>
<li> While at character level 41 to 80, it's best to level the legendary items to 31 and then deconstruct. It's commonly agreed this gives the best ratio of invested item XP to returned relics, gives a legacy scroll, and allows you to begin levelling another item for the same benefits quickly.
</li>
<li> While at character level 80 and up, it's best to level the legendary items all the way to item level 51 before deconstruction. For each of your final Legendary items that you'll be imbuing, you'll need about 9-12 million legendary xp. It's commonly agreed that deconstructing at 51 (or 56) gives back large xp runes and the highest tier of relics which can be used to create relics for the final item. Deconstructing at 56 would give back the best xp runes and the best relics.
</li>
<li> While at character level 95 and up, it's best to collect a set of complete legacy scrolls. Level 95 scrolls can be used in level 100 Legendary items.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've played a few toons and have a very good supply of items in your account (shards, marks, runes of experience) and understand the system well enough to min-max everything, you can level every item to level 51 or level 56 before deconstruction.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Crafting_Relics">Crafting Relics</span></h3>
<p>To craft the lowest tier of relics simply needs raw materials. Higher quality relics require pages from the Compendium of Middle Earth. These pages can be purchased in Skirmish camps or can be farmed from a daily repeatable quest.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Compendium 1. Talk to the relic master at Anazarmekham in Moria for the quest <i>Trace Metals</i>. TRAVEL ROUTE FROM BREE: South Bree to Great River to 21st Hall to Anazarmekham.
</li>
<li> Compendium 2. Talk to the relic master at Ost Galadh in Mirkwood for the quest <i>Silken Strands</i>.
</li>
<li> Compendium 3. Talk to Bron at Galtrev in Dunland for the quest <i>Forges of Isengard</i>. TRAVEL ROUTE FROM BREE: South Bree to Galtrev.
</li>
<li> Compendium 4. Talk to Frinoth next to the forge in the back section of Hytbold in Eastern Rohan for the quest <i>Iserngraf: Severance</i>. TRAVEL ROUTE FROM BREE: South Bree to Snowbourne to Hytbold.
</li>
<li> Compendium 5 doesn't have a single quest you can get it from. You can either use marks at a skirmish camp to get it, trade 100 Fangorn leaves to Quickbeam in Derndingle for it, or pay 50 Amroth Silver Piece to the Dol Amroth Quartermaster. TRAVEL ROUTE FROM BREE: Use Return to Derdingle travel point.
</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: It's really not worth doing the Compendium 1 or 2 quests on a daily basis. 
</p><p>Compendium 1 involves farming worms in the Flaming Deeps of Moria that have an incredibly low spawn rate. I'd do this once in case there's some deed attached to finishing the quest, and then never go back to it. It's painful.
</p><p>Compendium 2 involves running a long twisting path killing stealthed Mirkwood spiders to reach a cave full of easier-to-farm spiders. I would only recommend doing it until you finish out the Mirkwood spider-slaying deed. The relics that come out of this quest are worth 384 shards so they're kind of worth your time, but only barely.
</p><p>Both the Galtrev and Hytbold quests are fast and easy to finish.
</p><p>As a rule of thumb, it takes me as much time to finish either <i>Trace Metals</i> or <i>Silken Strands</i> as it does to finish both the Galtrev and Hytbold quests.
</p><p>If you have a surplus of skirmish marks and medallions, you can buy the assorted Compendium pages from the Crafting vendor in skirmish camps.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Upgrades_Before_and_After_Imbuement">Upgrades Before and After Imbuement</span></h4>
<p>Other than the notes listed below, there is no benefit to applying upgrades such as relics, empowerment scrolls, legendary titles, or star lit crystals added to DPS items before imbueing.
</p><p>Some old guides may state that there's a benefit to applying a scroll of delving before imbueing. This was correct in the past but was a result of buggy behavior that has since been fixed.
</p><p><b>Star Lit Crystals </b>
</p><p>There is a small benefit to applying Star-Lit Crystals to your item for some classes. Star-lits used before imbuement only provide a benefit to those classes that have main stats besides DPS that are affected by the crystals. To see if you are playing one of these classes, open your legendary item panel (Shift I) and go to your legendary items tab. The first legacy on the list will either be a DPS rating (Physical Damage), or some other stat (for example, Tactical Damage or Tactical Healing Rating). If you have something other than Physical Damage, that item will benefit from applying the Star-Lit Crystals before imbueing.
</p><p>Also, the passive stats on Two-Handed LI's (staff, halberd, 2h sword, runestones) will be slightly higher if you add three crystals before imbuing.
</p><p>If <b>both</b> your items have DPS ratings (Physical Damage) and neither is two-handed, then you will <b>not</b> benefit from applying the crystals before imbuement.

<li> Six <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Item:Anfalas_Star-lit_Crystal">Anfalas Star-Lit Crystals</a> per item (three before imbuing and three after). You'll want eight total if you're starting with a Second Age legendary item, or ten total if starting with a Third Age legendary item.
</li>
<li> One <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Item:Anfalas_Scroll_of_Empowerment">Anfalas Scroll of Empowerment</a> per rank below max each legacy is at on each item. Varies significantly, but estimate 20-22 for one item before imbuing and another 28 after. Having 50 total for your first item is a reasonable estimate if you want to maximize the item immediately after imbuing.
</li>
<li> One <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Legendary_Titles">legendary title scroll</a> per item.
</li>
<li> Three melded relics per item. For the choicest melded relics, estimate 10k shards + 4 Tier 9 relics for Trues (about 30k shards per item), and 11.2k shards + 3 specific Tier 10 relics for Tier 10's (about 34k shards per item). 
</li>
<li> One crafted relic per item. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>To craft a set of legendary items, special Symbols will be needed:
</p>
<ul>
<li> One <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Item:Blemished_Symbol_of_the_Elder_King">Blemished Symbol of the Elder King</a> for each level 100 First Age item.

</li>
</ul>
<p>For Every Bridle:
</p>
<ul>
<li> One Westemnet Bridle Emblem of Turning
</li>
</ul>
<p>It makes it *much* easier to steer/turn a war steed. If you don't want to use a Westemnet relic, an Eastemnet Bridle Emblem of Turning is effectively just as good (it's one less point of turn).
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="When_Is_A_Legendary_Item_Capped.3F">When Is A Legendary Item Capped?</span></h3>
<p>As of update 18.2, after imbuing, the legendary item is full when the default legacy and other legacies are each capped.
</p>
<ul>
<li> The default legacy is increased through the use of Star-Lit Crystals and has a maximum of 43 tiers.
</li>
<li> The other legacies are each increased through the use of Anfalas Scrolls of Empowerment and each has a maximum of 59 tiers.
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Essence_Gear_.28Armor_and_Jewelry.29">Essence Gear (Armor and Jewelry)</span></h3>
<p>Essence gear is the end game jewelery and armor. It is gear without stats, or with fixed stats (the same on every item) and several blank sockets. Essences (small stat gems) fit into the sockets.
</p><p>In general, the more sockets the better. However, in some cases there are set bonuses or the fixed stats are high enough on pieces with fewer slots to make it more powerful than items with more slots.
</p><p>Essence gear begins to "matter" around level 100. I would suggest most noobs get their hands on a set of crafted essence armor (talk to a leather worker or metal smith) and play with slotting in the essences they get from loot. For jewellery, just use a mix of purple and teal fixed stat gear at 100 that is granted as loot from Epic Battles.
</p><p>At 105 (or higher should the cap increase and I forget to update this) if you want to spend the time you can farm up essence jewelery. I happen to wear all teal fixed stat jewellery as I don't yet raid enough to make it matter. Also at 105 is time to farm up the choice essence armor you want. There is no crafted essence armor at this time, so the nnly end game armor is a few pieces of fixed stat gear available from quests, and the heavy grind end game gear.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Instances:_Skirmishes.2C_Epic_Battles.2C_Etc.">Instances: Skirmishes, Epic Battles, Etc.</span></h2>
<p>WARNING: I still don't entirely understand the different types of Instances. I will try not to provide any mis-information, however I will likely get some parts wrong.
</p><p>Some instances are solo content in the epic quest, and are not covered here. The instances I'm covering allow you to choose the size of your party. You can either solo them, duo them with another player, or have a group of 3, 6, or 12 players.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Skirmishes">Skirmishes</span></h3>
<p>Skirmishes are differentiated from other instanced quests by the inclusion of lieutenants and skirmish soldiers.
</p><p>A lieutenant is a named boss in skirmish fights. You can face the same lieutenant more than once in the same skirmish instance. Each lieutenant has specific strengths and weaknesses. Learning their weaknesses and how to take the different lieutenants down is a large part of the training for skirmish raids.
</p><p>Skirmish rewards are Marks and Medallions, and "bounty" items that can be sold for platinum money. You'll get fewer Medallions and more Marks than for an equivalent epic battle, making this a preferred way to solo farm Marks. 
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Skirmish_Soldiers">Skirmish Soldiers</span></h4>
<p>A skirmish soldier is a sidekick NPC character over which you have some control. There are several skirmish soldiers that each fill different roles including healing, melee dps, ranged dps, crowd control, and tanking.
</p><p>You can either pick a skirmisher that has a different role than you (healing when you're DPS, DPS when you're healing, crowd control or tank when you're a glass cannon) or more of the same (you and the skirmisher both DPS, both tank, both heal). The latter option is more useful in group play.
</p><p>The most common question for players new to skirmishes is "which skirmish soldier should I use?" The answer is a very unhelpful "whichever one you want". Any skirmish solider *can* be useful for any player.
</p><p>I have a couple rough rules of thumb I've been using:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Bring a herbalist (healer) if your character has weak self-healing.
</li>
<li> Bring a bannerguard (mixed role support) if you want a skirmish soldier who will look after themselves.
</li>
<li> Bring a sage (ranged DPS and debuffing) if you do tactical damage and want some debuffing. 
</li>
<li> Bring an archer (ranged DPS) if you're on a self-healing melee.
</li>
<li> Bring a warrior (AoE melee DPS) if you want to kill faster.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another rough rule of thumb is to use a Herbalist if you want to put the absolute minimum into paying medallions to level a skirmish soldier while having the maximum utility. A herbalist is useful to support any solo player, and will be welcome in any group content skirmish.
</p><p>The Bannerguard has several different unrelated skills it can learn including an aggro-generating taunt, a heal, and a melee DPS attack. It can also give an armor buff or an offensive damage buff to you and your allies. I feel the Bannerguard plays the most like having another self-sufficient player along. While it can't take down a lieutenant or full group of escorts by itself, it can be left to clean up the last fight or two at one gate or spawn point, while you run on to the next. I really like the Bannerguard, it's my favorite soldier.
</p><p>If you don't really care about skirmishes much, but want to level a soldier for group play (skirmish raids), then the herbalist is the best choice. It's always useful to have a little more healing and it will stay out of "trouble" in group content. Sages are also popular in some group skirmishes, but they're better left to more experienced players. If you like, you can put points into leveling both a Sage and Herbalist and select the one of most use based on your group leader's preferences..
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Skirmish_Traits">Skirmish Traits</span></h4>
<p>If the number one question asked about skirmish soldiers is "Which one should I use", then the number two question is "How should I trait my soldier".
</p><p>Skirmish soldiers have four types of traits:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Attributes - these cosmetic changes affect the role, race, sex, hair, and outfit of your Skirmish soldier.
</li>
<li> Skill - each class of Skirmish soldier has a different set of skills.
</li>
<li> Training - this is a pool of generic traits shared between all soldiers a particular character uses.
</li>
<li> Personal - this is a set of traits that buff your player character while your soldier is summoned.
</li>
</ul>
<p>To change the cosmetic attributes like the race or sex of your skirmisher buy upgrades from the Cosmetics vendor in the Skirmish camp. To buy or upgrade the other basic traits, get them from the Skirmish Trainer in the Skirmish camp. The Skirmish Captain is used to move traits around on your soldier, and also has a "Barter" option to buy special advanced and ultimate Skills for each soldier type. The advanced and ultimate skills are each slightly different than the basic skills, and provide extra utility for each role. 
</p><p>In general, I try to keep all traits within five levels of my character level. For a very simple list of starting traits, here's what I use on all of Eachna's Skirmish Soldiers. I use and level the regular skills before I unlock the advanced and ultimate skills. 
</p><p>You may notice I have tried to overlap Attribute, Training, and Personal traits as much as possible. This reduces the number of marks and medallions I need to spend to level everything.
</p><p>In cases where you're certain you only want to level one (or at most two) skirmish soldier, it may be more effective to level a few extra traits to make it more adaptable.
</p><p>Here are the traits I use on her Bannerguard:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Attributes: I use a female elf maiden with short white hair with bangs, and a surcoat of Man.
</li>
<li> Bannerguard Skills: Potent Strike, Inspiring Shout, Summon the Foe, Ultimate: Banner of Precision.
</li>
<li> Training: Physical Potency, Heavy Armor Training, Boundless Morale, Evasion Training.
</li>
<li> Personal: Tactical Artistry, Defender's Bane, Battle Master.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the traits I use on her Herbalist:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Attributes: I use a female elf maiden with short white hair with bangs, and a surcoat of Man.
</li>
<li> Herbalist Skills: Refreshing Herbs, Herbs of Boundless Endurance, Strengthening Draught, Ultimate: Words of Healing.
</li>
<li> Training: Tactical Potency, Light Armor Training, Boundless Morale, Evasion Training.
</li>
<li> Personal: Tactical Artistry, Defender's Bane, Battle Master.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the traits I use on her Sage:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Attributes: I use a female elf maiden with short white hair with bangs, and a surcoat of Man.
</li>
<li> Sage Skills: Chilling Winds, Word of Battle, Weakening Draught, Ultimate: Word of Flame.
</li>
<li> Training: Tactical Potency, Light Armor Training, Boundless Morale, Evasion Training.
</li>
<li> Personal: Tactical Artistry, Defender's Bane, Battle Master.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the traits I use on her Archer:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Attributes: I use a female elf maiden with short white hair with bangs, and a surcoat of Man.
</li>
<li> Archer Skills: Deadly Shot, Wounding Arrow, Pinpoint Shot, Ultimate: Bold Arrow.
</li>
<li> Training: Practiced Critical, Medium Armor Training, Boundless Morale, Evasion Training.
</li>
<li> Personal: Tactical Artistry, Defender's Bane, Battle Master.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since Archers are so dependent on criticals for their damage, I spent the marks to level Practiced Critical.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Epic_Battles">Epic Battles</span></h3>
<p>Epic Battles (also called "Big Battles" are a rather divisive inclusion from the LOTRO development team.
</p><p>Epic Battles are differentiated from other instanced quests by the inclusion of the battle role system. Also, unlike other instances, every character is scaled to level 100 (with a level boost if they're below level 100, and a level decrease if they're above 100).
</p><p>Completing specific objectives in each Epic battle earns Promotion Points, which are then spent on trait trees for the battle roles. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Promotions">Promotions and Promotion Points are explained here</a>. Unlike the class trees and mounted combat trees, each rank and tier of battle role skills costs an increasing number of promotion points.
</p><p>Epic Battles rewards include some of the best jewellery in the game, as well as Marks and Medallions, and level 100 essences. Jewellery rewards are set to your real level, not the scaled level. You'll get more Medallions and fewer Marks than for an equivalent skirmish, making this a preferred way to farm Medallions. 
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Epic_Battle_Roles">Epic Battle Roles</span></h4>
<p>There are three roles: Vanguard (DPS), Engineer (siege weapons), and Officer (NPC control). Each VIP player gets two battle role pages for free, while Premium and F2P players get one page. For a new player in big battles, Engineer and Officer will likely be the most useful roles. You can configure one role per page and switch between them in a single battle, or you can spend points in multiple trees for a hybrid build.
</p><p>I've been trying to find useful information about how to spend points for effective hybrid builds, but information is surprisingly thin.

<p>Here are some notes on each role that may be useful.
</p><p><b> Vanguard </b>
</p><p>People tend to not to speak favorably about the Vanguard DPS battle role, outside of the tier 6 Run Speed boost. I have the run speed boost on Eachna, but I may drop it as having any points at all in Vanguard puts a large bar for the role on your screen. I have not found a way to disable it.
</p><p><b> Officer </b>
</p><p>Officers allow you to place buffing Banners, and to issue orders to the NPC soldiers through the Commanders and Overseers.
</p><p>As a few rules of thumb, the Heal order (both cooldown and strength) and Switch Target order (cooldown), are the most useful. Make Haste (both cooldown and strength) is only useful for one side mission, and then only in the raid version ("Sealing the Culvert"). I quite like the tier 5 Engineer Banner Strength buff for hybrid builds, but I wouldn't argue it's a necessity.
</p><p><b> Engineer </b>
</p><p>The Engineer tree has the most useful skills of the battle trees. Being able to place barriers and manipulate siege machinery are vital to the success of any battle and many optional missions. Rank 3 as an Engineer is an important break point to any epic battle build.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Shame_and_Pain">Shame and Pain</span></h4>
<p>Epic Battles are notorious within the LOTRO community for being poorly documented, having unclear objectives, and a tutorial that is effectively useless. The tutorial teaches you how to unpack and fire a siege weapon, but otherwise doesn't allow you to test any battle role skills.
</p><p>It's a common experience for new players to step into their first Big Battle and either be overrun, or watch objective after objective fail with no indication as to what they did wrong. It's confusing, frustrating, and upsetting.
</p><p>IN GENERAL, before you unlock your first rank, each role's contribution to the battle is so negligible as to seem useless. In addition, several objectives have been deliberately written so that if you do what you think objective states, you'll fail.
</p><p>An example of a few tricky objectives:
</p>
<ul>
<li> One objective directs you to defeat the spirits attacking a water mill. To succeed at the objective, you have to destroy the NPC summoners, not the spirits themselves.
</li>
<li> One objective directs you to guard horses. The only interactive option you get for the horses is to release them and it states they'll flee to safety. If you release all the horses, the objective automatically fails.
</li>
<li> One objective is to guard workers moving rocks. If you don't assist the workers and *also* carry rocks in solo/duo mode, the objective will likely run out of time and fail.
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two primary routes to getting past these issues:
</p>
<ul>
<li> To repeatedly do the battles, and quite likely fail a lot, until you start to learn the different stages and objectives and how to succeed at them.
</li>
<li> To ask a friend or friends with high battle role ranks to carry you through several battles to unlock a lot of promotion points for you.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The best thing you can do to get through the battle on your own, is to play your regular class, and ignore the promotion points until you've acquired at least 20 points. Attack mobs with your regular DPS attacks. Use the starting collection of Officer commands to inspire, heal, and buff the troops near you. Use healing class skills on banners, siege equipment, barricades, friendly NPCs, and other interactive items around the battlefield, as well as using the starter Engineer repair/break options if they're available. You *can* heal and repair at the same time. Cut down ladders and grappling hooks (it slows the swarms of enemies, which makes it easier for the NPC troops to win their fights). Try every objective, and aim to get the most basic "bronze" completion. 
</p><p>After you've earned 20 promotion points, you can start taking the battle roles more seriously, and putting effort into effectively using the skills. Be prepared to switch roles: use the Engineer battle skill to operate a catapult when it's needed, and then switch to Officer and rally/heal the troops.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Rebuilding_Hytbold">Rebuilding Hytbold</span></h2>
<p>At level 84 you get the opportunity to rebuild Hybold in the Eastemnt of Rohan. Reaching level 84 generates a mail message that opens up the area quests.
</p><p>The rebuild of Hytbold is accomplished through a repetitive daily grind of quests. It unlocks armor and special area cosmetics, instances, and some other nice features. Because most of the nice "stuff" can be passed to alts once the entire area has been fully completed once on an account, you shouldn't feel the need to repeat the grind on other toons past unlocking the crafting materials instances for any crafting toons.
</p>
<ul>
<li> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.lotro.com/forums/showthread.php?482751-Hytbold-A-Guide-to-Rebuilding-and-Armour">Hytbold Forum Guide to Rebuilding and Armor</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose your five daily quests from sixteen quests randomly available each day. There are four quests each in the main settlements of the four areas: Snowbourn, Harwick, Cliving, and Eaworth.
</p><p>Completing a daily quest will also reward you with 1200 reputation for that area's faction.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Eaworth = Entwash Vale reputation
</li>
<li> Snowbourne = Sutcrofts reputation
</li>
<li> Harwick = Wold reputation
</li>
<li> Cliving = Norcrofts reputation
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because there are five daily quests and four quests per faction, you will always gain reputation with at least two factions per day if you do all quests.
</p><p>It requires "Ally" reputation and the rebuilt stables to use fast travel options between Hytbold and the various regional towns.
</p><p>To help with the reputation grind, you might want to check out the 'Curiosities' vendor at each of the skirmish camps. For 60 marks and 6 medallions they barter a Small Reputation Accelerator Tome. The tomes add 1,000 total rep on turn-in.
</p><p>Another option is to trade Tokens of Hytbold for reputation. You end up with significantly more tokens than you will likely want to spend on armor and home furnishings (the two main draws of Hytbold) and so burning tokens for reputation is a good way to speed up the otherwise slow grind.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Skipping_Content">Skipping Content</span></h2>
<p>Turbine sells instant-level upgrades called "Gift of the Valar" (instant boost to level 50) and "Blessing of the Valar" (instant boost to 95) in the in-game store. This can be a contentious point with people, but it's very much a fact of life in LOTRO so I may as well put in some notes about it.
</p><p>I feel the solution for instant leveling that Turbine provides is rather shady. Your average person using a boost will expect to have a functional character after the boost process is finished. Because of LOTRO's virtue system and the way trait points are earned, this turned out to be incorrect. After using a level boost you cannot simply begin playing level-appropriate content. You still 'have' to go back to lover-level content and farm it for the deeds needed to increase virtues and to provide trait points.

<li> You can only get 10 points in the Fishing hobby each day. It's a good idea to fish daily until you max it out. It's useful for festivals and Titles/Deeds. Some mid and high level quests are only available to those with the fishing hobby.

<li> You can get a new quest from Bingo Baggins once a week (depending on your level). These quests pay out Bingo Badges. The badges can be traded for cosmetic pets, house decorations, and a nice mount.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Mounts_and_Warsteeds">Mounts and Warsteeds</span></h2>
<p>This is one of my favorite elements of the game. I fully acknowledge it's a bit "silly" to collect fake horses in a MMO, but it's fun and fairly harmless.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mounts">Mounts</span></h3>
<p>More to Follow
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="War_Steeds">War Steeds</span></h3>
<p>"Medium" War steeds are available to all players (including Free to Play). Light and Medium War Steeds (as well as extra horse-based quests) are only available to players who bought the Riders of Rohan Expansion. For both types of players, the Helm's Deep expansion contains additional Mounted Combat content. Officially war steeds are available from level 75, but if you can survive the quests you can do them earlier. I earned Eachna's war steed at level 71 while still wearing (and carrying) mostly level 60-ish gear. 
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Builds_and_Traits">Builds and Traits</span></h4>
<p>There are three builds of war horses: "Light", "Medium", and "Heavy". These control the war steed's base stats.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Light war horses are the fastest and most agile, with the least hit points and power. They're meant for DPS builds.
</li>
<li> Medium war horses are balanced. Most of their stats are in the middle between light and heavy builds. They're meant for support builds.
</li>
<li> Heavy war horses are the slowest and least agile, with the most hit points and power. They're meant for tank builds.
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are three trait trees: "red", "yellow" and "blue". These correspond to the three trait trees each class can have.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Red has DPS skills.
</li>
<li> Yellow has support and crowd control skills.
</li>
<li> Blue has healing and tank skills.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The trait trees and builds are modular, so you could build a heavy war steed with DPS traits or a light war steed with support traits. Each build will have a slightly different selection of colored traits. This means that the DPS tree for heavy horses is different than the DPS tree for medium or light horses.
</p><p>The steeds are rather difficult to control for new players, so it's probably a good idea to start with a medium build and then switch to light or heavy once steering is no longer an issue.
</p><p>The two most important traits on the war steed are agility and power. I'd recommend new players put 3 points in Agility, then 3 points in Power, and only then start spending points in their colored trees.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="War_Steed_Legendary_Bridles">War Steed Legendary Bridles</span></h4>
<p>The War Steed bridles are simply another type of Legendary Item. They fit into one of your existing legendary item slots and can be examined and manipulated using the default SHIFT-i hot key combination.
</p><p>There are three types of bridles: "Light", "Medium", and "Heavy". They can be slotted on any build of horse, but the major legacies are assigned based on the named build. The minor legacies draw from the same pool for all builds.
</p><p>A "Light" bridle's major legacies will only come from the Light war steed's trait trees. This means that if you put a Light bridle on a Medium build horse, it will only benefit from the minor legacies.
</p><p>In order to avoid cluttering legendary item slots this means it's probably best to pick one build and stick with it for the long term. That means you only have to level 1-2 bridles at a time, leaving 4 free slots for the weapon and class item.
</p><p>I started with a Medium build on Eachna, but I switched to Light after experimenting with the speed and agility of the two builds. The Light steed runs faster and has better turning than the Medium steed. That means once I leave the Mounted Combat zones the Light build will be the most useful as a general mount.
</p><p>One of the best investments of resources you can put into your legendary bridle is a crafted Bridle Relic of Turning. The Westemnet version is +11 Turning, while the Eastemnet version is a very close +10 Turning. I suggest the Eastemnet version so that you can spend Westemnet crafted relics on your class weapon and item.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="War_Steed_Cosmetics">War Steed Cosmetics</span></h4>
<p>War steed hides and manes/tails are a plain grey color on the basic steed. Make sure to equip the horse's solid grey body color, simple tail style, and plain saddle. It will look a little less homely this way. 
</p><p>The spotted leopard appaloosa hide color can drop from the Eastement warbands from the Riders of Rohan expansion. All other horse colors are sold in "packs" in the LOTRO store.
</p><p>Along with the horse colors, you can get visible accessories to further customize your mount. These include halters (bridles), saddles, caparisons (blankets), and leggings (leg straps/decorations). You can get several accessories for free, as well as buying others in the store. They can only be re-colored by purchasing color "packs" in the store. Scholar dyes do not work on war steed equipment.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Festival_Events">Festival Events</span></h2>
<p>There are several holiday events for LOTRO players.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Treasure_Hunt">Treasure Hunt</span></h3>
<p>I found this one kind of boring but I did get a nice mount on my first night playing it so I guess I shouldn't complain.
</p><p>It's a fairly simple premise. There's a special section of hills with buried treasure. Small sloth-like animals called Cave-Claws can identify promising holes, or you can just dig in any hole you see.
</p><p>You need Treasure Hunter's Pickaxes to dig. The rate of spawns are gated behind two free quests that give you axes and cave claws. The free quests are called "Berries" and "Treasure Hunt". You can repeat the two quests every 15 minutes, or buy pickaxes from the Turbine Store. It's really not worth it to buy the pickaxes from the store as they're 50 TP each.
</p><p>You want big holes (large or even huge) as they have the better loot drops in them. You need a Cave Claw or Dowsing Gem to tell you what size hole you have.
</p><p>If you have a long block of time to play, I suggest spending a couple hours doing the two free quests. Then, once you have a stash of pickaxes and cave claws, you can spend more focused time looking for big holes.
</p><p>You can also use a Dowsing Gem. Here is the table for Dowsing Gem messages:
</p>
<ul>
<li> You're getting a very weak reading - Small Dig-site
</li>
<li> You're getting a slight reading - Medium Dig-site
</li>
<li> You're getting a strong reading - Large Dig-site
</li>
<li> You're getting a very strong reading - Huge Dig-site
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Yule">Yule</span></h3>
<p>My first Yule turned out to be a frustrating grind. One of the most desirable cosmetic items from Yule is an outfit for a war steed. There's two each Yule, one that was new the previous year and one that is new the present year (and will show up again the following Yule). You have to repeat the assorted Yule quests to get a total of 120 completions to unlock the war steed cosmetics. 
</p>
<ul>
<li> The theater play is a lot of fun (although around day 6 or 7 it gets just as repetitive as anything else). You don't have to be there for the entire performance, just the end part that sends the "You attended a performance" message. You can actually enter when the curtain is closing and still get it. 
</li>
<li> To get credit for participating in the eating contest you only have to finish the first table, which is un-timed. 
</li>
<li> Once you've unlocked all the snowmen forms for the title and free house decorative snowman you only ever have to do the Broken Snowman (which only requires two parts to complete).
</li>
<li> You can 'cheer' the same Snowbeast three times. You don't have to run between all the snowbeasts cheering them.
</li>
<li> Don't start the snowball fight unless someone else is also ready to do it. If you're the only one there the quest fails.
</li>
<li> Try to run at least two toons through your first Yule and have one take the side of the Mayor and one take the side of the poor folks. This will get you two sets of cosmetic outfits.
</li>
<li> If you go for the 120 completions you will end up with more tokens than you'd expect. By focusing on 3 toons in Yule I unlocked both cosmetic mounts for each toon, a Grim for each, the two war steed outfits on each toon, the snowbeast cloak and boots, and still had over 50 tokens on each toon. I then ran a 4th toon to just get the assorted winter cosmetic outfits.
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spring_Festival">Spring Festival</span></h3>
<p>I'm not yet understanding what I'm supposed to be doing for Spring Festival.
</p><p>There's a quest that starts a small chain about flower picking that you get from Avery Crabapple at the Boar Fountain in Bree. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.taultunleashed.com/lotro-guides-secrets-tricks/lotro-guides-spring-festival-flower-collecting-t71950.html">Spring Festival Flower Collecting</a>. 
</p>
<ul>
<li> Marigolds are found just outside Michel Delving 
</li>
<li> Primroses are found just outside Celondim.
</li>
<li> Violets are found just outside Bree.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Token Trader can be found at the Party Tree at the Hill just north of Hobbiton.
</p><p>Other than that, I haven't found any quests to do.
