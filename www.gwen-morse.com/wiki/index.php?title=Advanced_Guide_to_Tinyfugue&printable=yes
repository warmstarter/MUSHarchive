The Advanced Guide to Tinyfugue v2.0
--------------------------------------------------------

OK, so you've read the Beginners guide. You know your aliases from your 
hotkeys. You think you know all there is to know about targets; but you've 
heard there is even more you can do, yet you don't know how...
Well, to cater to popular demand, here is a (hopefully) user friendly guide 
to programming Tinyfugue to suit you!

Basically, things are going to get complicated from here on. It is not so 
much a case of 'follow the instructions, get the answer', it is more 'here's 
an example, see what you can come up with'. If you're not happy with this, 
then don't worry. Tinyfugue at a basic level works as well as Avplay. 
Anything more is a bonus, and simply personal taste. One day, I'm going to 
see if I can program Tinyfugue to run a fight completely by itself... just to 
see if it can be done!

One last point. Most of the examples here will be very 'mage' skill 
orientated. This is because most of the examples are lifted wholesale from, 
or modified versions of my own tf files. This is a lot easier than trying to 
think of examples pertinent to all guilds - at this kind of level of tf, the 
commands are mostly specialised functions anyway, so you will have to think 
for yourself of ways to use the commands to make YOUR life easier. If you want 
to do it, tf probably can do it - you just have to find a way.



Right, if you're still here, I take it you're willing to experiment a bit. 
After all, you learn best by making mistakes, and correcting them. Here's 
what I'm going to cover:

[1] /set                Learn to use /set, and variables to their full 
			potential
					
[2] .tfrc               Preloads files for you

[3] /speedwalk.tf       Tf's answer to gallop

[4] /repeat             Bulk repetition of commands, and one off time delays

[5] /edit               Altering a macro from within the macro itself

[6] /quote              Performs a list of commands, with a time delay at 
			each step

[7] /gag                Prevents lines being printed on screen

[8] /log                Saves output to a log file 

[9] /recall             Scrollback

[10] /more              Turns output from continuous to page by page

[11] Boolean            What the hell is that, I hear you ask...
     Algebra    

[12] /expr              A calculator

[13] -b etc.            summary of /def options






[1] /Set
---------

The first thing I'm going to introduce is an extension to the variables 
system, which we used in a very limited way in the Beginners Guide to define 
targets. It is a lot more powerful than this, and can improve combat 
performance. It also can cut a lot of drudgery out of doing things.

Now, I use a lot of potions. Around 15 at once, in fact. Since the colours 
can be changed by a number of enemy attacks, I wanted a way to use potion 
bottle numbers, without having to change the number in every list entry of 
my triggers/hotkeys/aliases every single time I bought a replacement potion. 
How do you do this, I hear you ask.
What you do, is write another file which you load in when start up tf, 
somewhat like your alias and macros files.

The contents of this file looks something like this:

/set&nbsp;%magenta=potion55843
/set&nbsp;%vermillion=potion663
/set&nbsp;%grey=potion93802
/set&nbsp;%white=potion77748
/set&nbsp;%red=potion2886
etc., you get the idea.

What you do, is set a load of variables to be your potions. So, let us take 
one of your old hotkeys. It probably used to look something like this:

(1)      /def -p1 -b'[112~' = drink magenta potion%;drink vermillion potion
%;drink red potion

or if you were fed up of having your potions being colour changed,

(2)     /def -p1 -b'[112~' = drink potion55843%;drink potion663%;drink 
potion2886

And of course, every time you buy a new potion, you have to update this 
hotkey by hand.

But now, you rewrite it to look like this:

(3)     /def -p1 -b'[112~' = drink&nbsp;%magenta&nbsp;%; drink&nbsp;%vermillion&nbsp;%; drink&nbsp;%red

When tf sees (3), it will substitute the variables you defined earlier, and 
actually send statement (2) to avalon. The difference is, your potion bottle 
numbers are defined in this SEPARATE FILE, which you can load into your UNIX 
texteditor, and edit there, quickly and easily. Then, just reload the edited 
potions file, it will replace the old variables for the new, and no matter 
how many times you've used&nbsp;%white in your triggers, they will all now use the 
new number. It is so easy to edit potion bottle numbers, I have been known to 
start using a new potion (when the old one ran out), edit my potions file, 
and keep using my hotkeys, all in the middle of a fight!

N.B. You will have to write your potions list in an external texteditor, and 
use /load to put it into Tinyfugue, as I don't know a way to bulksave 
variables to a file. You should be using an external editor by now anyway; 
if you're anything like me, then your list of triggers and hotkeys will be 
too unwieldy to mass edit using /undefn and /list anyway.



Variables are extremely useful. Another way I have used them is to define a 
variable for my two pipes - one hold megillos, the other arkasu. I then 
define two macros, which light and smoke the relevant pipe variable. Then, 
whenever I want to smoke, say megillos, in an autoresponse, I just call the 
macro.

I.e. in my external variables file, I have
/set mpipe = pipe5555

then, I can define things such as:
/smpipe = light&nbsp;%mpipe%;smoke&nbsp;%mpipe

then finally, 
/bind [112~ = outp megillos%;put megillos in&nbsp;%mpipe%;outp arkasu%; etc
/trig *a demonic pestilence gives you anorexia* = /smpipe






Spod comment!! 
- Here's something for you technobuffs out there: the&nbsp;%; indicator used to 
split commands is in fact a variable, same as&nbsp;%t or&nbsp;%magenta. It just 
substitutes a carriage return instead.








[2] .tfrc
----------

Now would probably be a good time to introduce .tfrc
This is a small file you keep in your tf.lib directory, and very useful it is 
too. Instead of having to load in every file you need, every time you start 
up tf (I have about 8 preload files, so it saves me a good deal of typing) 
you put them into this hidden file. 

Example contents of .tfrc file:
/visual on
/require speedwalk.tf
/load macros
/load aliases
/load potions
/telnet ibmpcug.co.uk

since using this file takes the drudgery out of loading in your tf files, you 
can make up even more files. Now, instead of having all your triggers,hotkeys 
macros etc. in a single file, you can farm them out to separate files. Say, 
have a separate file for your hotkeys, another for your poison defences etc. 
This will make it easier to modify/add to your defences later, rather than 
slog through your single massive file.


[3] speedwalk.tf
-----------------------

Ok, you spotted me /requiring speedwalk.tf. What is it? Well, it's tf's 
answer to gallop. Initialise it with /SPEEDWALK ON. from then on, 
ordinary commands must be typed in caps. Anything in lower case is either 
ignored, unless it's n,e,s or w. You can also have mutiple commands, such as 
50n. This will go north 50 times. Useful in the labyrinth to azrilli!


[4] /repeat
--------------

Here is one of tinyfugue's more advanced features, timed commands. The 
/repeat command is tremendously versatile, so it's really up to you what you 
think of to do with it. Here are a couple of examples:

Let's say you are herb picking. Who wants to type 'pick iorthir' 20 times, 
then 'prepare iorthir' 20 times, and then 'inp iorthir' ANOTHER 20 times?
Now you don't have to...

/repeat 20 pick iorthir%;prepare iorthir%;inp iorthir

will do this set of commands 20 times - i.e. pick, prepare, inp, pick, 
prepare etc.



Now, let's say you are still herb picking, but now you are giving the herb 
to someone else. In order to give them a chance to put it in their herbpouch, 
you want a three second delay between the commands:

/Repeat -3 20 give iorthir to hero
will do the trick.


Since it waits for the time delay before executing, this is a useful way for 
executing a single command, with a time delay in front of it. For example:

/alias 1 sketch all%;/repeat -3 1 dance power

Allows for the time delay required for equilibrium between sketching and 
dancing a ritual.

N.B. The following command will NOT work:
/alias 1 sketch all%;/repeat -3 1 dance power%;sketch all%;/repeat -3 
1 dance convergence

When tf sees the&nbsp;%; after a repeat, it ends the /repeat section, and treats 
the next command as normal.
So, what tf would do in this case is sketch all, sketch all, (wait 3 sec.) 
dance power, dance convergence.

There are several ways to get around this. The first that you will think of 
(probably) is this:
/alias 1 sketch all%;/repeat -3 1 dance power%;repeat -9 1 sketch all
%;/repeat -12 1 dance convergence

(If you didn't know, sketching requires 3 sec. to regain equilibrium, dancing 
needs 6)

However, this is a clumsy way of doing it. Imagine if you wanted to dance 12 
rituals in sequence - this macro would be somewhat messy, to say the least! 
The more streamlined way of doing this is to use another command called 
/quote. For details, see later. 
However, /repeat can also be useful for doing a string of commands, with a 
single initial time delay. Let's look at a way to defend against 'sloth' 
spells: 
 



First, you define a way to break sloth. One way is to use speed (mauve) 
potion. The first sloth dispels this, the second sloth slows command entry 
down for a while. If you DO get slothed, speed will break you out of it 
immediately, though there is a couple of seconds delay before you actually 
perform the action of drinking. 

/def speed = drink&nbsp;%mauve potion&nbsp;%; /edit -c0 speed 
%; /repeat -5 1 /edit -c100 speed

This command defines '/speed' to do the following actions:
1) drink my mauve potion
2) disable itself (so it won't be triggered again)
3) re-enable itself after 5 seconds

How does this work? Well, let's take a look at /edit...

[5] /edit
-----------

/edit allows you to change the properties of a macro, from within the body of 
a macro. You can change any of it's properties, such as -t (triggers) or 
-h(hiliting). The property I have changed here is '-c' which is the 
probability of the macro responding when it is called. The number following 
-c is the percentage chance of it responding. A value of 100 means it will 
always respond, (which is the default value), a value of 0 means that the 
macro is effectively inactive, and a value of 50 means it will only trigger 
half of the time. (I told you tf had a lot of weird commands! This isn't the 
half of it)

Therefore, by using /edit, -c and /repeat in combination, I can temporarily 
disable a macro, from within the macro itself.



/Repeat (continued)
----------------------------

Now, returning to /speed.

So, why did I go to all this bother? Well, let's define some triggers that 
will call speed.
When you are slothed, here are SOME of the messages that avalon sends. 

/def -p1 -mglob -t'You lurch into action.' = /speed
/def -p1 -mglob -t'*to normal walking speed*' =drink&nbsp;%mauve
/def -p1 -mglob -t'You shake away the effects of the idyll.' = drink&nbsp;%mauve

Now, when you are slothed, and try to do something, you get the message 'you 
lurch into action'. After several seconds, you actually perform the action. 
If, in that time, you try to perform another action, your first act is 
cancelled, the second act is initiated, and you have to wait for several 
seconds for THAT action. Therefore, if you just put 'drink mauve potion' as a 
response to the trigger 'you lurch into action', you will just stand there 
trying to repeatedly drink, and resetting the 'lurch' message every time - 
effectively immobilising you. Therefore you only want to drink ONCE, and 
wait for it to work. Then, when you are moving at normal speed, you want the 
trigger to be ready to go again,  in case you get slothed once more. 

In this case, I have defined some extra triggers, so that when I recover from 
sloth, I drink my mauve potion, and go to speeded motion. This means I have 
to be slothed twice in order to actually be slothed. 



[6] /quote
--------------

/repeat is not the only timed command. There is a second, called 
(you guessed it) /quote.

This command is very useful for doing a list of actions, with a time delay 
between each one. On of it's primary uses is setting up standing, pre-combat 
magical defences. With non-magical defences such as potions, you can just 
stack them onto one macro, and perform the lot in one go. With magic however, 
you have to wait for equilibrium, and thus build in a time delay between each 
command.

The best way to look at quote is an example:

/quote -7  ' &quot;rituals&quot;


Simple, isn't it!

Here is how it works:

the apostrophe tells /quote that it should read it's data from an external 
file (From the start-up directory). The name of the file is enclosed in 
quotes, and in this case is called rituals. (You might have noticed that 
when it comes to naming files, I tend to follow the principle of calling a 
spade a spade, not a 'General Issue Entrenching Device, or GIED' as the army 
call it!)
The -7 means that /quote will go down the list of entries in the file 
'rituals' and send each one to avalon seven seconds apart. So, here is a 
sample of what the file 'rituals' might contain -

sketch all
dance power
sketch all
dance fortification
sketch all
dance leech enemies
etc.

You could put in your file whatever avalon commands you want to repeat x 
seconds apart. Here is another example:

/alias start-up /quote -4 ' &quot;startup&quot;

where the external text file startup contains:

weave veil
weave halo
weave blur
weave binding
etc.

You might note that for 3 second equilibrium spells I use 4 sec separation, 
and 6 sec equilibrium, 7 sec separation. This is to account for minor lag 
problems, and means I don't lose the odd spell, as I don't quite have 
equilibrium for it yet.



[7] /gag
-----------

This is a command similar to /hilite. Effectively, it removes messages from 
the screen. This can be useful if you get regular annoying messages that you 
don't need to see, but that just clog up your screen. E.g.

/gag *A white dragon is too cumbersome to lift*




[8] /log
----------

/log is relatively straightforward. Basically, it takes everything that tf 
puts on screen, and puts it into a log file.

/log (filename) will start logging, if you don't specify a filename, it 
defaults to tf.log.

/log off will turn logging off, and not add anything more to the text file.



[9] /recall
-------------

This command basically allows you to scroll back. /recall (n) will recall the 
last n lines of avalon output, up to a maximum of 1000. Note, if you do a 
second recall, after the first, it doesn't count the first ones output as 
avalon output. Therefore, if you do a recall, but it doesn't go back far 
enough, you can do another, with more lines, with no problem.

You can combine /recall with /log - let's say you were ambushed, and want a
log of the action, after the events. First, you start logging, with 
/log ambush. Then you /recall up to the start, say /recall 500. The 
recalled lines will go into the log, then you just /log off, and read the
text file ambush at your leisure.



[10] /more
---------------

since /recall can zoom past pretty quickly, you might want to slow it down a 
bit. Use /more on
This will do page by page scrolling - when it has done a page, it wil wait 
for you to press &lt;TAB&gt; before doing the next page. You can have /more at any 
time - but t's only real use is when /recalling. Use /more off 
to turn it off.




[11] Boolean Algebra
------------------------------

OK, what the hell is Boolean algebra? Basically, it is a set of logic 
operands, that allow the performing of logic operations.

OK, what the hell is that in PLAIN ENGLISH? &nbsp;:-)

If you don't know what AND, OR logic is, then switch off now. If you do, 
then that is what Boolean Algebra is - the combination of AND, OR and other 
similar operators to solve logic operations. The most I'm going to say about 
Boolean Algebra, is that tf supports it. I haven't yet found a combat use for 
it. You might, so look at the on-line tf help files for more details. The 
same applies to programming loops - for, while etc. They exist, but I haven't 
found a need for them yet. This is because I like to use my client to cut 
some of the drudgery, not take over the fight entirely. In the end of the 
day, I'm faster, more flexible, and more intelligent than my client - or at 
least, I hope I am!

One possible use might be to only turn certain triggers on when you're
in certain situations - For example, Shaitan used to have a trigger
off Fiorella's name to burn the forest. Therefore, she found it hard to
decompose him - he would enter the room, see her name in the room description,
and automatically set fire to the trees! This would obviusly be rather
awkward to have on all the time - imagine it going off every time you
typed 'who'. So, you could define a variable, and set the trigger to only
respond when both the trigger text is valid, and the variable logic high.



[12] /expr
--------------

Handy little function for when you're comm gathering. Basically, it works 
like a mini-calculator. For example, say there are 25 pieces of fruit, at 
14gp each in isabella. How much gold do you need?
/expr 25*14
gives you the answer, 350.

You can also use /expr to evaluate Boolean functions - if you want to...



[13] summary of the /def options
-----------------------------------

You've probably noticed by now that tinyfugue uses /def for every single 
hotkey, macro, trigger etc. It merely changes the options. Well, here's a 
summary of the options you're most likely to run into.



-p              determines the priority of a trigger
-t'...'         triggers when ... text is passed from avalon to tf.
-h'send ...'    triggers when ... &lt;CR&gt; is entered
-b'...'         triggers when ... is entered
-ah             highlights the triggering text 
-mglob          defines method of matching trigger text
-ag             'gags' i.e. hides triggering text
-c ...          will trigger ...% of the times it is called



Well, that's the end of the advanced guide. Hope it's been fun for you all...
I'm sure I'll be editting this guide later - who knows, I might even produce
the Ultimate guide to Tinyfugue... 

N.b. here's a rather succinct command:
/time

Both terribly handy, and totally useless. Says everything about Tinyfugue 
really.
