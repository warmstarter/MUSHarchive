@@ This amusing bit of code is a simple vendor based on girls and boys found at Renn Faires. 
@@ I combined several jobs into one, and then used SCA terms to create a 'SCA-tender' to help

@create Wandering Wench=10
@Desc Wandering Wench=%r[u(wench-name)] is a pretty teenaged girl dressed in a white chemise and a low-cut boned bodice that causes her large breasts to defy gravity in the most amazing ways. She has pulled one side of her skirt up and tucked it in at the waist, displaying her finely-curved legs and the dusty tops of her bare feet.%r%rThis poor girl is obviously over-worked. She has a basket over one arm heaped with cut flowers and ripe peaches, she's pushing a wheeled barrel with the word &quot;pickles&quot; carved into it, and there's a &quot;T&quot;-shaped pole attached to the barrel from which dried flower garlands hang. It's all quite a load for her to move around with.%r%rYou can 'buy' one of several products from [u(wench-name)]: 'flower','pickle','peach', or 'garland' ('buy &lt;product&gt;').%rYou can also ask her to 'serve' you something from the food court: 'turkey leg','stir fry'(veggie), or 'steak on a stick' ('serve &lt;food&gt;')%r
