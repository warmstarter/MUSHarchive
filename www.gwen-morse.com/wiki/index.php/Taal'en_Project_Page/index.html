<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Taal.27en_Project_Page">Taal'en Project Page</span></h2>
<p>This page is a reference for those interested in working on projects for the Chancellor builder of Verron IV, on the TinyMUSH game of CrystalMUSH.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Taal.27en_Descing">Taal'en Descing</span></h3>
<p>Each set of descriptions will earn IC "credits" (money) as well as name "credit" (recognition) for having provided the area. What I need is for people to describe large numbers of rooms, to be used in dynamic space. Dynamic space is BASICALLY a way to cram alot of room descriptions into a limited amount of quota. You move through a series of perhaps 4 or 5 rooms, but the descs keep changing, so it LOOK like more. And the rooms are FLOATING, so they can move around in any order.
Credit pay-scale: 100/credits per room. Most jobs will be between 10 and 20 rooms, and therefore earn between 1000 and 2000 credits. Bonus pay for extra descriptions (see the information on 'activities' below) or names and descriptions of new native plants or animals (also see information below). Names should be descriptive or have a Polynesian spelling to them.
</p><p>For Taal'en: 1 mountain range (old volcanos) including some cliffs to climb/different levels, 1 grassland/savannah/grassy plain of 10+ rooms (think African savannah)
</p><p>The format I need is in an ASCII text file attachment for email (NOT online, only email, I have to fiddle with it before I can port it). There should be NO hard returns/carriage returns formatted in EXCEPT at the end of each attribute. Extra hard returns will mess up my ability to port it properly and therefore create more work for me&#160;:).
</p><p>Each room should look like this in the file:
</p><p>&amp;name-1 array=The Bat Cave
&amp;desc1-1 array=This is a long, dark cave with bat guano everywhere.  A lone robin perches on a rock staring at you intently. Your light sparkles off crystals inset into the walls. The humid air of the cave is almost stifling.
&amp;desc2-1 array=This is a long, dark cave with bat guano everywhere.  A lone robin perches on a rock staring at you intently. Your light sparkles off crystals inset into the walls. The dry air of the cave irritates your parched throat.
</p><p>&amp;name-2 array=The Twisty Junction
&amp;desc1-2 array=This is a long twisty junction. Bone-white flowers bloom out of a crevice in one wall. It's a cave with lots of tunnels branching off. Go figure.&#160;:).
&amp;desc2-2 array=This is a long twisty junction. Dry roots have split themselves a crevice in one wall. It's a cave with lots of tunnels branching off. Go figure.&#160;:) 
These are just sample descs, but they give you an idea. And the real descs should be longer. (5-6 sentences for most rooms, with some (perhaps 1/4 overall) having 8-10 or more). For Taal'en each room would have 2 descs, each the same except for some sort of change based on the time of year (rainy season or dry season). There are only these two seasons on Taal'en.
</p><p>These room descs CANNOT 'force' any particular arrangement or order. I have to arrange the descs on the object that holds them to best fit the dynamic space I have 'left'. So, while you can desc things that look like they should be near each other, you cannot pick which direction they should go. For a good example of what I need, check out the dynamic Rainforest on Taal'en. Wander around in there, and you'll see how areas fit into each other, without giving particular directions. As a better explanation here, you can put a stream in one room, and then continue it in another. You cannot say "the stream flows north" in one room, and then say "The stream from the south" in the next.
</p><p>You are free to make up names for the local plant life. I would love to see more trees, plants, and flowers that have Polynesian-sounding names.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Improve_The_Menu">Improve The Menu</span></h3>
<p>We have an existing menu, but, it could use more items. Here are the present categories to give an idea what types of dishes are needed. Sushi-like fish rolls have already been commissioned, but, that job hasn't yet been completed.
</p>
<pre>         CLASS   Class Description
 ------------------------------------------------------------------
  COMBINATIONS   Dishes with a combination of ingredients.
        DRINKS   Other potable items sold in the Nausora Cafe.
         FRUIT   Various native fruit.
         JUICE   Various refreshing drinks made of squeezed local fruits.
         MEATS   Meat, Eggs, and Fish
        SWEETS   A limited range of sweets.
    VEGETABLES   Various Raw and Cooked Vegetables and Roots
</pre>
<p>Some sample items already available for purchase (as examples of descriptions):
</p>
<ul>
<li> The serving person hands you a platter with a whole small roasted Blueback lizard. The eyes have been replaced with golden raisins. It looks quite meaty.
<ul>
<li> A small Blueback Lizard stuffed with fermented sour Mapale paste, coated in salt, and slow roasted in a firepit until very tender. The lizard's tough skin has been slitted to allow steam to escape. The meat melts in your mouth with a rich, yet tart taste. There are lots of little bones to pick through.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> You get a chilled, ripe Maleka fruit. 
<ul>
<li> As its name implies, the Opa'maleka (Maleka), or Greenshell Fruit, is a pale green in color, both the thin and hard gourd skin and the fleshy fruit itself. In the center of the fruit are four star-shaped seeds. Children make wishes before planting these seeds. The flesh of this melon is frosty-cold, and tastes fresh and very 'green', starting out tart and finishing up sweet. It has a sharply astringent herbal scent. The various scents and flavors are often confusing to the senses, but, can be enjoyed by a wide range of palates.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> You buy a golden Tlalik fruit. 
<ul>
<li> The golden Tlalik fruit is a ritual gift between native lovers on Taal'en. The juice is squeezed and fermented to make the slightly alcoholic Tlalik cider, but Tlalik is also popular served as a whole fruit. There are several local superstitions about the total number of tiny white seeds found in an individual fruit (which range from four to twenty), as well as whether the count is odd or even. The edible skin is golden yellow, while the crisp and crunchy fruit is a pale cream color. The fruit is slightly tart with a satisfyingly mild flavor. This fruit has [rand # generated] inedible seeds.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> You buy the Timmin egg omelet. 
<ul>
<li> This is an omelet made with one, large Timmin egg and bits of local vegetables. It is filled with bits of the roasted Serpentine Lizard, Oparu sprouts, and shredded Malile leaves. The omelet is fluffy, with a light green tone from the yolk mixed in. The chopped meat and vegetables add a somewhat chewy texture to the dish.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> You get a freshly baked Mapale sweet. 
<ul>
<li> This is the favorite sweet of Taal'en. Fermented licorice-flavored Mapale paste is allowed to firm and then is rolled in coarse-ground sugarcane and tiny dried pieces of Lailai fruit. The resulting sweet has a chewy, sweet exterior and a tart, cake-like interior. The very center is filled with whole red summer berries.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Taal.27en_Flora">Taal'en Flora</span></h3>
<p>The best way to improve the planet is to know what's there already. Here's bits of the local culture as already described around the assorted locations.
</p><p>Some pre-existing plants and trees:
</p><p>Mangroves (like the Earth tree)
</p><p>Tekik trees: native coniferous (pine) trees with fist-sized cones.
</p><p>Lianas (like the Earth vine)
</p><p>Rattan (like the Earth palm)
</p><p>Bamboo (like the Earth grass)
</p><p>Orchids (like the Earth flowers)
</p><p>Umber trees: native umber-brown hardwood trees that bloom with small white flowers in the rainy season and which bear a woody seeds in the dry. (a five-parted woody capsule containing squarish winged seeds).
</p><p>Fortress trees: native hardwoods with buttressing roots that contribute to the name. 4-sided branchlets with long leaves in the rainy season and a aromatic fragrance from the wood year-round.
</p><p>Wardwood shrub: native leafy shrub that repells the native insects of Taal'en with its pleasantly-scented wood.
</p><p>Sibling Tree: native tree that sends out ariel roots and branches out into many trunks appearing to be a stand of trees. Grows as large as a house.
</p><p>Siphon Plants: native plants like water bamboo or other water grass (hollow stems).
</p><p>Goldleaf Strangler Tree: native tree which grows roots into other trees roots and kills them. Has golden leaves in the rainy season and intricately wrapped roots in the dry.
</p><p>Hangman's Moss (aka "Dangling Moss"): Native moss that can be harvested and woven into strong and sturdy rope.
</p><p>Food plants:
</p><p>Sugarcane (like the Earth plant for sweetening).
</p><p>Opa'maleka ("Greenshell fruit") vine with green gourds (In the center of the fruit are four star-shaped seeds)/Maleka juice.
</p><p>Sami salt-harvested underwater vine with red pulply fruits/Samila juice. Think "Gatorade" or other sport-type drinks, if they came from fruit.
</p><p>Lailai bush with tiny yellow fruit/VERY sweet Lailai juice. Used to flavor many foods on Taal'en. Roughly corresponds to citrus fruits in flavor and use.
</p><p>Toke'aina ("Yellowfruit") fruit/Toke'aina juice. Roughly corresponds to pineapple. The juice of this fruit is always served over shaved ice.
</p><p>Yanggona bush with resinous leaves and bark for the tea-like Yanggona brew.
</p><p>Fautasi ("Longboat") melon. A green-fleshed melon with a hard shell, shaped like the native longboats.
</p><p>Criwes melon. A lavender-fleshed melon with many black seeds. Similar to watermelon.
</p><p>Tlakik fruit. A golden fruit exchanged between couples as a pledge of their devotion. The fruit is riddled with tiny white seeds that have complex connotations of good and bad luck based on the number (similar to counting flower petals for "He loves me...he loves me not"). Often squeezed and then fermented. It can also be served whole.
</p><p>Mapale fruit. This is a fruit that's pulped and fermented as part of a complicated process, and then used to flavor native dishes. It has a disctinctive licorice-like flavor.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Taal.27en_Fauna">Taal'en Fauna</span></h3>
