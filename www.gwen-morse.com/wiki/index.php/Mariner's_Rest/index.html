&amp;VIEW_MUSIC here=Music is piped in via speakers placed at strategic points. The volume is quite low, to encourage conversation. Also, it tends to be softer music, acoustic, folk, Celtic fusion, or jazz and blues. *No* industrial is available.
@Desc here=%r[space(5)]This is a pleasant eatery that focuses on the atmosphere as much as the food preparation. An impressive collection of objects from around the world decorate the walls. The showpieces of the collection have been used to ornament themed booths that run along the walls to either side of the main floor &lt;+view&gt;. An inviting bar stretches the length of the room opposite the entrance. Swinging doors at either end of the bar provide the waitstaff with access to the kitchens. The table settings are plain white china and clear glass as a subtle foil to the brilliant decorations all around.%r
&amp;VIEW_CHINESE-BOOTH here=The seatcovers for this booth are made of sturdy upholstery fabric block-printed with large, angular Chinese calligraphy characters. Layers of silk kimono are pinned into spreading wings of vibrant blue, green, and silver on the wall the booth is inset into. There is a red paper lantern hanging from the ceiling over the booth table to provide light.
&amp;VIEW_FRENCH-BOOTH here=The seatcovers for this booth are made of sturdy tapestry fabric glittering with golden threads forming fleur-de-lys. Several museum prints of engravings of France's famous 'Sun King' - Louis the XIV are pinned to the wall the booth is inset into. The prints represent the yellow-haired adolescent king wearing the costumes of dramatic roles - Apollo the Sun-God, a lute player, and warrior of France. In addition, there is a hand-painted scene of Jeanne d'Arc - Saint Joan of Arc - mounted on a rearing horse, waving a great sword above her head to rally her troops to battle. Finally, a pair of stained white satin ballet toe shoes are knotted firmly to the mini-chandelier hanging from the ceiling over the booth table to provide light. The ink signature scribbled on one shoe has blurred to illegibility.
&amp;VIEW_MEXICAN-BOOTH here=The seatcovers for this booth are made of sturdy upholstery fabric woven with stylized Mezto-American wave and step patterns, interspersed with spirals and human-looking figures. Pottery gleams in a shatterproof display case secured on the wall the booth is inset into. There are red bowls, and a white clay jug, and even an unusual Oaxaca black clay pot. A simple lamp hangs from the ceiling over the booth table to provide light. The cord it hangs from has been wrapped with a long fringed belt woven of red, yellow, and blue wool.
&amp;VIEW_AUSTRALIAN-BOOTH here=The seatcovers for this booth are made of shearling lambskins sewn together so the short, creamy-white wooly fibers provide a soft cushion. Photographs of breathtaking Australian scenery are mounted along the wall the booth is inset into. Ice-cold tundric mountains contrast with a steamy-looking scene of crocs at rest. Australian cowboys herd wild brumby horses past the impossibly-tall bases of red buttes. The final photo is of Aboriginal stone carvings and paintings. There is a bright Coleman-style electric camping lamp hanging from the ceiling over the booth table to provide light.
&amp;VIEW_ALASKAN-BOOTH here=The seatcovers for this booth are made of squares of heavy canvas painted with images of the Aurora Borealis and then sewn into an elaborate patchwork shape. Small Inuit soapstone and scrimshaw carvings nestle in a shatterproof display case secured on the wall the booth is inset into. There are small animals including birds, seals, a polar bear, and a walrus with tiny wire eyeglasses. A simple lamp hangs from the ceiling over the booth table to provide light.

&amp;MON_LUNCH_SPECIAL foo=The lunch special is a Chinese &quot;Dim Sum&quot; dumpling platter meant to &quot;touch your heart&quot; and a pot of hot Chinese green tea. You are given the chance to use (or experiment with) plastic chopsticks if you are so inclined. Each dumpling is a center of chopped and seasoned meats and vegetables wrapped in dough and steamed or deep fried until cooked. There are several bowls of sauce. One is yellow hot mustard, another is orange duck sauce, a third is dark soy sauce, and the last is a dark soy-based liquid with scallions floating on top and other flavors mixed in. Your plate has thirteen dumplings: fried pork egg roll, steamed pork dumpling, steamed chicken fun roll, steamed lotus seed roll, steamed scallion dumpling, steamed octopus ball, sticky rice wrapped with a lotus leaf, fried shrimp and pork dumpling, steamed bamboo shoot and shrimp dumpling, fried beef dumpling, spring roll, roasted pork bun, glutinous rice roll. This looks like enough food to feed a small army, or one hungry Merchant Marine. Your tea is served very hot in a small ceramic teapot. There are cubes of sugar in a little bowl next to a saucer of lemon slices, but, even without extra flavors, the tea has a soft and mellow taste. The Dim Sum dumplings are delicious. Some fillings are highly spiced, and others are almost bland, while the majority have a moderate, tasty flavor. They all explode with seasoning once you dip a dumpling in sauce.
&amp;MON_DINNER_SPECIAL foo=The dinner special is Chinese &quot;Peking Duck&quot;, served with bean sprouts and a bowl of white rice, plus a pot of hot Chinese green tea. You are given the chance to use (or experiment with) plastic chopsticks if you are so inclined. The crispy duck skin has been neatly sliced and arranged on thin dumpling-wrapper &quot;pancakes&quot; with a sprig of scallion and a dab of some unusual brown sauce. You are supposed to roll up the pancake, dip it in extra sauce served to the side (if you so choose), and eat it in a few careful bites. The sauce is not soy sauce, nor does it taste like soy was used as a base. Instead, it's thick and chunky with a carmelized flavor, almost like barbecue sauce. The seperate duck meat has been cooked with bean sprouts, and is meant to be eaten over the rice. Your tea is served very hot in a small ceramic teapot. There are cubes of sugar in a little bowl next to a saucer of lemon slices, but, even without extra flavors, the tea has a soft and mellow taste. Desert comes in the form of a deep-fried hot dough shell around a core of still-frozen vanilla ice-cream.
&amp;TUE_LUNCH_SPECIAL foo=The lunch special is French &quot;Soupe au Pistou&quot;, pasta soup, served with peasant bread topped with melted cheese. The steaming bowl of chicken stock has floating bits of vegetables mixed in with different kinds of curly and tubular pasta. A round slab of french bread covered with melted cheese can be enjoyed on its own, or enhanced by dipping into the broth. The soup was cooked with only a hint of garlic, so the delicate vegetable and olive oil flavors also come through. The country cheese melted onto the chewy bread is pleasantly salty.
&amp;TUE_DINNER_SPECIAL foo=The dinner special is &quot;Coq au Vin&quot;, chicken braised in red wine. Small pieces of chicken on the bone have been fried with chunks of bacon and baby mushrooms. They're served coated with a thickened sauce of chicken stock, brandy, and tomato paste. There's a subtle hint of garlic and olive oil to the sauce. The side dishes are a crispy, generously-sized artichoke heart salad tossed in balsamic vinegar, and tiny peeled potatoes baked in dill and olive oil. You can choose between several options of wine to compliment the entree. Desert is a plate of fruit-filled crepes, each decadent roll drizzled with heavy melted chocolate and then dusted with powdered sugar and chocolate shavings.

&amp;TRISKELLE foo=Triskelle is a pretty young woman with fine-boned, Celtic-looking features and very white skin. A sleek cloak of black hair shimmering with blue highlights frames jade-in-amber hazel eyes. Her nose is long and thin. High, fragile cheekbones and pale pink lips balance a pointed chin. Her hair falls loose in glossy tendrils around her face, the hip-length back caught in a simple gold band near her waist. Her waif-like and narrow figure is shown to advantage in an unstructured sleeveless linen top and matching pants. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;The Mariner's Rest&quot;. Tattooed knotwork bands circle her softly-muscled upper arms.
&amp;TRISHA foo=Trisha is a pretty young woman with fine-boned, Celtic-looking features and very white skin. A soft cloud of long auburn curls frames boldly-lined sultry eyes as green as new leaves. Her small nose is slightly upturned, and sprinkled with pale golden freckles. Softly rounded cheeks and full lips balance a curved chin. Her hair has been caught up in a topknot with a barrette marked with Celtic key patterns -- it tumbles past her shoulders almost to her tiny waist. High, full breasts, and a curvy rear are shown to advantage in a snug hand-dyed linen top and matching pants. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;The Mariner's Rest&quot;. Slightly-faded reddish-brown complex spiral patterns have been henna-painted on the backs of each of her hands.
&amp;TRISTAN foo=Tristan is a handsome man who looks boyish at first glance, but is probably at least thirty (or older) upon closer examination. Buff-blond hair falls to his shoulders framing fine blue eyes with thick golden-brown lashes. Strong cheekbones and a sensual mouth balance a square chin. His long pale hair gives him a rather roguish 'Viking' air, complimented by a somewhat darker goatee. He's very wide-shouldered with a broad chest, narrowing into lean hips and somewhat thin legs. All his strength seems to be centered in his upper body. He wears twill pants and a short-sleeved cotton shirt. The shirt has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;The Mariner's Rest&quot;. A Scottish bull has been tattooed on his left bicep, while an Irish lion-headed knotwork band circles his right forearm.

&amp;WED_DINNER_SPECIAL foo=The dinner special is Mexican pork and black beans served over rice. The pork is cut into bite-sized cubes that were browned with onion, mild chili peppers, and garlic, then, simmered in a tomato and coriander stock for several hours, along with the meaty black beans. This flavorful dish is served on a hot steaming bed of rice garnished with minced cilantro. All the common flavors of Mexico seem to be blended into this one meal. Desert is &quot;Dulce Zacatecano&quot;, a rich treat created with just a few simple ingredients. Sliced butter-fried bananas are layered with sugar and heavy whipped cream flavored with dry sherry and vanilla, the whole chilled into firmness.
&amp;WED_LUNCH_SPECIAL foo=The lunch special is a plate of four large Mexican enchiladas. Blue corn tortillas are rolled around chicken and cheddar cheese mixed with jalapeno chili sauce flavored with cilantro. Each is topped with chopped onions, cheese, and sour cream. The tortillas are soft, with just a hint of oil to their mild corn flavor. Each heavy bite is tongue-tingling and spicy. Chicken and tomatoes provide a chunky contrast to the smooth melted cheese and rich sauce. The outer topping blends together to cool any burning caused by the hot filling. Extra chili sauce and sour cream are served in small ceramic bowls on the side, to adjust the spice level to taste.

&amp;FRI_LUNCH_SPECIAL foo=This is the Alaskan Lunch Special.
&amp;FRI_DINNER_SPECIAL foo=This is the Alaskan Dinner Special.
&amp;SAT_LUNCH_SPECIAL foo=The lunch special is Polish smoked sausage boiled with sauerkraut served on a bed of boiled buckwheat groats, with a side of boiled beets. While the whole meal is boiled, it is far from bland, because all the elements have strong flavors brought out with fresh seasonings and a healthy amount of salt. Wood smoking has sealed wonderful tastes and fragrances into the brick red pork sausage. The cabbage in the sauerkraut is pickled in a special brine that uses water imported from the Baltic Sea. The whole buckwheat groats have a dusky, nutty, almost wild-rice taste that's complimented by the butter and grated goat's-milk cheese mixed within, while, finally, the beets still have an edge of crispness to their texture to avoid that &quot;yucky&quot; softness so familiar in their canned counterparts.
&amp;SAT_DINNER_SPECIAL foo=The dinner special is a Polish pork cutlet (&quot;kotley&quot;) served with baby potatoes and steamed mixed vegetables. A boneless cutlet is pounded till nearly paper thin and large enough to fill its own dinner plate, breaded and sprinkled with special seasonings, and then fried in butter. Topping the kotley are red-skinned baby potatoes roasted with dill, and steamed mixed vegetables. A boat of pork gravy with just a hint of apple-like flavor is served to the side. Dessert is &quot;Ambrozja&quot;, and it truly is 'Food of the Gods'. Scoops of chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry ice-cream are topped with fresh strawberries, blueberries, grapes, chunked pineapple and sliced peaches, and raisins, then drenched with fruit syrup and cognac. A final layer of hand-whipped cream and chopped nuts makes it even more rich and decadent. This meal proves that while the Poles may be the butt of many jokes, they get the last laugh in their traditional foods.
&amp;SUN_LUNCH_SPECIAL foo=The lunch special is a selection of native Australian meats served with mixed greens and fried mushrooms. A heaping salad of mixed greens and tomatoes tossed with a tangy vinaigrette dressing supports generous slices of crocodile, emu, kangaroo, and a whole small crayfish-like &quot;Botany Bay Bug&quot;. The crocodile and bug have soft, mild flavors brought out by slightly sweet glazes. The stronger &quot;gamey&quot; flavors of the emu and kangaroo are accented by spicy herbal sauces. Each slice of meat has a tiny paper Australian flag marked with a black silhouette of the animal it came from. Instead of a potato dish, whole white mushrooms have been fried in a blend of clarified butter and olive oil until they couldn't absorb any more of the flavorful goodness. The bed of salad has been chilled before serving, while the meats and mushrooms are piping hot, creating another contrast for the senses.
&amp;SUN_DINNER_SPECIAL foo=The dinner special is an Australian lamb &quot;roast dinner&quot; meal -- as is still regularly served for Sunday family meals. A leg of lamb has been roasted and sliced thinly to display the prized medium-rare level of doneness. Roasted potato wedges cooked in the same pan as the lamb have been drizzled with melted herb butter. Next to the potatoes, a salad of crunchy mixed greens, tomatoes, and mushrooms has been lightly tossed with the tangy house vinaigrette dressing. Bowls of brown gravy and mint sauce are included on the side. Dessert is Pavlova, a sugary vanilla-flavored meringue baked into a stiff, lightly browned mound. In the hollowed center, sliced and chunked fruits rest in a layer of whipped cream -- kiwi, passionfruit, strawberries, mango, and star fruit.

&amp;KENDRA here=Kendra is a short, curvily-built African-American woman in her early twenties. She has relatively pale skin, like cream with coffee added for color. Her pale golden eyes give her expression a cat-like intensity. Her nose is short and rather flat, sprinkled with dark brown freckles. Long, high cheekbones and naturally pink lips balance a strong chin. She has tightly-curled black hair that's been trimmed close to her scalp, framing the purity of her features. Her full-bosomed figure is shown to advantage in a snug sleeveless linen top and matching pants. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;The Mariner's Rest&quot;. A bold black tribal-band tattoo encircles each of her forearms.
&amp;KENNETH here=Kenneth is a slim multi-racial man in his late forties or possibly early fifties. Deep golden skin and exotic features emphasize his blended ethnicities, as does his shoulder-length cloak of silky black hair. His nose is long and blade-sharp. High cheekbones and full lips balance a square chin. Cool, almost serpentine, light brown eyes regard the world with calm detachment. He wears a pair of twill pants and a short-sleeved knit top. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;The Mariner's Rest&quot;.
&amp;KENDIS here=Kendis is a waifishly-thin, short girl in her late teens or early twenties, who speaks with more than a hint of an Irish brogue. A curly mop of golden-blond hair frames large cornflower-blue eyes. Softly rounded cheeks and curved lips balance a pointed chin. She's gangly enough to appear to still have a few inches of growth to add to her height, before she'll start to fill out in other directions. Her petite figure is shown to advantage in an unstructured sleeveless linen top and matching pants. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;The Mariner's Rest&quot;. A series of Celtic knotwork bands stained in blue woad dye spiral up each of her arms.
&amp;KENNA here=Kenna is a gracefully-ageless pale woman of average height. Her greying light brown hair is drawn into a bun, away from her cool, serene features. Manicured eyebrows arch over large oval eyes the color of fine carnelians. She has an aquiline nose, sharp cheekbones, and a budlike mouth. Each of her features is delicate, but, in sharp relief. Ornamental braids twisted with green and gold beads provide a decorative touch to her hairstyle. Her slim figure is shown to advantage in an flattering sanded silk top and matching skirt. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;The Mariner's Rest&quot;. She is marked in blue woad pigment with flowing frond designs on the backs of her hands, and in a collar-design around her neck.
&amp;KENDALL here=Kendall is a short, plump, copper-haired young woman in her twenties. She has slightly darker skin than most redheads, tanned to a light golden brown. Her eyes are very blue, and very round. Rounded cheeks, an upturned nose, and a full mouth complete her squirrelishly-cheerful features. Two ponytails of very curly hair froth down to her waist, with a fringe of bangs across her forehead. She's very short, not anywhere near five feet tall even with shoes on, and her perfect posture only seems to emphasize her small stature. She weighs more than the fashionable ideal, as lush and ripe as a summer peach. Her softly-fleshed figure is shown to advantage in a fitted short-sleeved linen top and matching loose pants. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;The Mariner's Rest&quot;.
&amp;KENNSINGTON here=Kennsington is a tall, rangy young man with the lean, hungry-eyed look of someone still growing. He has short wavy brown hair, as full and fluffy as thistledown. Slightly-tilted brown eyes topped with nearly black eyebrows are girlishly oversized in his face. His nose and mouth seem sketched into place, almost incomplete when contrasted with those large eyes. His flat young muscles ripple with potential under gypsy-brown skin. Large hands and feet are another indication that he's still growing. He wears a pair of twill pants and a short-sleeved knit top. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;The Mariner's Rest&quot;. The back of each of his hands is tattooed with a rather crude design of a stylized eye circled by pointed stars.
&amp;TRISHA here=Trisha is a pretty young woman with fine-boned, Celtic-looking features and very white skin. A soft cloud of long auburn curls frames boldly-lined sultry eyes as green as new leaves. Her small nose is slightly upturned, and sprinkled with pale golden freckles. Softly rounded cheeks and full lips balance a curved chin. Her hair has been caught up in a topknot with a barette marked with Celtic key patterns -- it tumbles past her shoulders almost to her tiny waist.%r[space(5)]Trisha speaks with a mild southern accent. She wears clothing suitable to the season.
&amp;TRISTAN here=Tristan is a hansome man who looks boyish at first glance, but is probably at least thirty (or older) upon closer examination. Buff-blond hair falls to his shoulders framing fine blue eyes with thick golden-brown lashes. Strong cheekbones and a sensual mouth balance a square chin. His long pale hair gives him a rather roguish 'Viking' aire, complimented by a somewhat darker goatee. He's very wide-shouldered with a broad chest, narrowing into lean hips and somewhat thin legs. All his strength seems to be centered in his upper body. A Scottish bull has been tattooed on his left tricep, while an Irish lion-headed knotwork band circles his right forearm.%r[space(5)]Tristan speaks with more than a hint of an Irish brogue. He wears clothing suitable to the season.

@Desc here=%r[space(5)]This is a pleasant eatery that focuses on the atmosphere as much as the food preparation. An impressive collection of objects from around the world decorate the walls. The showpieces of the collection have been used to ornament themed booths that run along the walls to either side of the main floor &lt;+view&gt;. An inviting bar stretches the length of the room opposite the entrance. Swinging doors at either end of the bar provide the waitstaff with access to the kitchens. The table settings are plain white china and clear glass as a subtle foil to the brilliant decorations all around.%r
&amp;VIEW_CHINESE-BOOTH here=The seatcovers for this booth are made of sturdy upholstry fabric block-printed with large, angular Chinese calligraphy characters. Layers of silk kimono are pinned into spreading wings of vibrant blue, green, and silver on the wall the booth is inset into. There is a red paper lantern hanging from the ceiling over the booth table to provide light.
&amp;VIEW_FRENCH-BOOTH here=The seatcovers for this booth are made of sturdy tapestry fabric glittering with golden threads forming fleur-de-lys. Several museum prints of engravings of France's famous 'Sun King' - Louis the XIV are pinned to the wall the booth is inset into. The prints represent the yellow-haired adolescent king wearing the costumes of dramatic roles - Apollo the Sun-God, a lute player, and warrior of France. In addition, there is a hand-painted scene of Jeanne d'Arc - Saint Joan of Arc - mounted on a rearing horse, waving a great sword above her head to rally her troops to battle. Finally, a pair of stained white satin ballet toe shoes are knotted firmly to the mini-chandelier hanging from the ceiling over the booth table to provide light. The ink signature scribbled on one shoe has blurred to illegibility.
&amp;VIEW_MEXICAN-BOOTH here=The seatcovers for this booth are made of sturdy upholstry fabric woven with stylized Mezto-American wave and step patterns, interspersed with spirals and human-looking figures. Pottery gleams in a shatterproof display case secured on the wall the booth is inset into. There are red bowls, and a white clay jug, and even an unusual Oaxaca black clay pot. A simple lamp hangs from the ceiling over the booth table to provide light. The cord it hangs from has been wrapped with a long fringed belt woven of red, yellow, and blue wool.
&amp;VIEW_AUSTRALIAN-BOOTH here=The seatcovers for this booth are made of shearling lambskins sewn together so the short, creamy-white wooly fibers provide a soft cushion. Photographs of breathtaking Australian scenery are mounted along the wall the booth is inset into. Ice-cold tundric mountains contrast with a steamy-looking scene of crocs at rest. Australian cowboys herd wild brumby horses past the impossibly-tall bases of red buttes. The final photo is of Aboriginal stone carvings and paintings. There is a bright Coleman-style electric camping lamp hanging from the ceiling over the booth table to provide light.
&amp;VIEW_ALASKAN-BOOTH here=The seatcovers for this booth are made of squares of heavy canvas painted with images of the Aurora Borealis and then sewn into an elaborate patchwork shape. Small Inuit soapstone and scrimshaw carvings nestle in a shatterproof display case secured on the wall the booth is inset into. There are small animals including birds, seals, a polar bear, and a walrus with tiny wire eyeglasses. A simple lamp hangs from the ceiling over the booth table to provide light.

&amp;MON_LUNCH_SPECIAL foo=The lunch special is a Chinese &quot;Dim Sum&quot; dumpling platter meant to &quot;touch your heart&quot; and a pot of hot Chinese green tea. You are given the chance to use (or experiment with) plastic chopsticks if you are so inclined. Each dumpling is a center of chopped and seasoned meats and vegetables wrapped in dough and steamed or deep fried until cooked. There are several bowls of sauce. One is yellow hot mustard, another is orange duck sauce, a third is dark soy sauce, and the last is a dark soy-based liquid with scallions floating on top and other flavors mixed in. Your plate has thirteen dumplings: fried pork egg roll, steamed pork dumpling, steamed chicken fun roll, steamed lotus seed roll, steamed scallion dumpling, steamed octopus ball, sticky rice wrapped with a lotus leaf, fried shrimp and pork dumpling, steamed bamboo shoot and shrimp dumpling, fried beef dumpling, spring roll, roasted pork bun, glutinous rice roll. This looks like enough food to feed a small army, or one hungry Merchant Marine. Your tea is served very hot in a small ceramic teapot. There are cubes of sugar in a little bowl next to a saucer of lemon slices, but, even without extra flavors, the tea has a soft and mellow taste. The Dim Sum dumplings are delicious. Some fillings are highly spiced, and others are almost bland, while the majority have a moderate, tasty flavor. They all explode with seasoning once you dip a dumpling in sauce.
&amp;MON_DINNER_SPECIAL foo=The dinner special is Chinese &quot;Peking Duck&quot;, served with bean sprouts and a bowl of white rice, plus a pot of hot Chinese green tea. You are given the chance to use (or experiment with) plastic chopsticks if you are so inclined. The crispy duck skin has been neatly sliced and arranged on thin dumpling-wrapper &quot;pancakes&quot; with a sprig of scallion and a dab of some unusual brown sauce. You are supposed to roll up the pancake, dip it in extra sauce served to the side (if you so choose), and eat it in a few careful bites. The sauce is not soy sauce, nor does it taste like soy was used as a base. Instead, it's thick and chunky with a carmelized flavor, almost like barbecue sauce. The seperate duck meat has been cooked with bean sprouts, and is meant to be eaten over the rice. Your tea is served very hot in a small ceramic teapot. There are cubes of sugar in a little bowl next to a saucer of lemon slices, but, even without extra flavors, the tea has a soft and mellow taste. Desert comes in the form of a deep-fried hot dough shell around a core of still-frozen vanilla ice-cream.
&amp;TUE_LUNCH_SPECIAL foo=The lunch special is French &quot;Soupe au Pistou&quot;, pasta soup, served with peasant bread topped with melted cheese. The steaming bowl of chicken stock has floating bits of vegetables mixed in with different kinds of curly and tubular pasta. A round slab of french bread covered with melted cheese can be enjoyed on its own, or enhanced by dipping into the broth. The soup was cooked with only a hint of garlic, so the delicate vegetable and olive oil flavors also come through. The country cheese melted onto the chewy bread is pleasantly salty.
&amp;TUE_DINNER_SPECIAL foo=The dinner special is &quot;Coq au Vin&quot;, chicken braised in red wine. Small pieces of chicken on the bone have been fried with chunks of bacon and baby mushrooms. They're served coated with a thickened sauce of chicken stock, brandy, and tomato paste. There's a subtle hint of garlic and olive oil to the sauce. The side dishes are a crispy, generously-sized artichoke heart salad tossed in balsamic vinegar, and tiny peeled potatoes baked in dill and olive oil. You can choose between several options of wine to compliment the entree.

&amp;TRISKELLE foo=Triskelle is a pretty young woman with fine-boned, Celtic-looking features and very white skin. A sleek cloak of black hair shimmering with blue highlights frames jade-in-amber hazel eyes. Her nose is long and thin. High, fragile cheekbones and pale pink lips balance a pointed chin. Her hair falls loose in glossy tendrils around her face, the hip-length back caught in a simple gold band near her waist. Her waif-like and narrow figure is shown to advantage in an unstructured sleeveless linen top and matching pants. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;The Mariner's Rest&quot;. Tattooed knotwork bands circle her softly-muscled upper arms.
&amp;TRISHA foo=Trisha is a pretty young woman with fine-boned, Celtic-looking features and very white skin. A soft cloud of long auburn curls frames boldly-lined sultry eyes as green as new leaves. Her small nose is slightly upturned, and sprinkled with pale golden freckles. Softly rounded cheeks and full lips balance a curved chin. Her hair has been caught up in a topknot with a barette marked with Celtic key patterns -- it tumbles past her shoulders almost to her tiny waist. High, full breasts, and a curvy rear are shown to advantage in a snug hand-dyed linen top and matching pants. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;The Mariner's Rest&quot;. Slightly-faded reddish-brown complex spiral patterns have been henna-painted on the backs of each of her hands.
&amp;TRISTAN foo=Tristan is a hansome man who looks boyish at first glance, but is probably at least thirty (or older) upon closer examination. Buff-blond hair falls to his shoulders framing fine blue eyes with thick golden-brown lashes. Strong cheekbones and a sensual mouth balance a square chin. His long pale hair gives him a rather roguish 'Viking' aire, complimented by a somewhat darker goatee. He's very wide-shouldered with a broad chest, narrowing into lean hips and somewhat thin legs. All his strength seems to be centered in his upper body. He wears twill pants and a short-sleeved cotton shirt. The shirt has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;The Mariner's Rest&quot;. A Scottish bull has been tattooed on his left bicep, while an Irish lion-headed knotwork band circles his right forearm.

&amp;WED_DINNER_SPECIAL foo=The dinner special is Mexican pork and black beans served over rice. The pork is cut into bite-sized cubes that were browned with onion, mild chili peppers, and garlic, then, simmered in a tomato and coriander stock for several hours, along with the meaty black beans. This flavorful dish is served on a hot steaming bed of rice garnished with minced cilantro. All the common flavors of Mexico seem to be blended into this one meal. Desert is &quot;Dulce Zacatecano&quot;, a rich treat created with just a few simple ingredients. Sliced butter-fried bananas are layered with sugar and heavy whipped cream flavored with dry sherry and vanilla, the whole chilled into firmness.
&amp;WED_LUNCH_SPECIAL foo=The lunch special is a plate of four large Mexican enchiladas. Blue corn tortillas are rolled around chicken and cheddar cheese mixed with jalapeno chili sauce flavored with cilantro. Each is topped with chopped onions, cheese, and sour cream. The tortillas are soft, with just a hint of oil to their mild corn flavor. Each heavy bite is tongue-tingling and spicy. Chicken and tomatoes provide a chunky contrast to the smooth melted cheese and rich sauce. The outer topping blends together to cool any burning caused by the hot filling. Extra chili sauce and sour cream are served in small ceramic bowls on the side, to adjust the spice level to taste.

&amp;FRI_DINNER_SPECIAL foo=This is the Alaskan Dinner Special.
&amp;SAT_LUNCH_SPECIAL foo=The lunch special is Polish smoked sausage boiled with sauerkraut served on a bed of boiled buckwheat groats, with a side of boiled beets. While the whole meal is boiled, it is far from bland, because all the elements have strong flavors brought out with fresh seasonings and a healthy amount of salt. Wood smoking has sealed wonderful tastes and fragrances into the brick red pork sausage. The cabbage in the sauerkraut is pickled in a special brine that uses water imported from the Baltic Sea. The whole buckwheat groats have a dusky, nutty, almost wild-rice taste that's complimented by the butter and grated goat's-milk cheese mixed within, while, finally, the beets still have an edge of crispness to their texture to avoid that &quot;yucky&quot; softness so familiar in their canned counterparts.
&amp;SAT_DINNER_SPECIAL foo=The dinner special is a Polish pork cutlet (&quot;kotley&quot;) served with baby potatoes and steamed mixed vegetables. A boneless cutlet is pounded till nearly paper thin and large enough to fill its own dinner plate, breaded and sprinkled with special seasonings, and then fried in butter. Topping the kotley are red-skinned baby potatoes roasted with dill, and steamed mixed vegetables. A boat of pork gravy with just a hint of apple-like flavor is served to the side. Dessert is &quot;Ambrozja&quot;, and it truly is 'Food of the Gods'. Scoops of chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry ice-cream are topped with fresh strawberries, blueberries, grapes, chunked pineapple and peaches, and raisins, then drenched with fruit syrup and cognac. A final layer of hand-whipped cream and chopped nuts makes it even more rich and decadent. This meal proves that while the Poles may be the butt of many jokes, they get the last laugh in their traditional foods.
&amp;SUN_LUNCH_SPECIAL foo=The lunch special is a selection of native Australian meats served with mixed greens and fried mushrooms. A heaping salad of mixed greens and tomatoes tossed with a tangy vinaigrette dressing supports generous slices of crocodile, emu, kangaroo, and a whole small crayfish-like &quot;Botany Bay Bug&quot;. The crocodile and bug have soft, mild flavors brought out by slightly sweet glazes. The stronger &quot;gamey&quot; flavors of the emu and kangaroo are accented by spicy herbal sauces. Each slice of meat has a tiny paper Australian flag marked with a black silhouette of the animal it came from. Instead of a potato dish, whole white mushrooms have been fried in clarified butter mixed with olive oil, till they couldn't absorb any more of the flavorful goodness. The bed of salad has been chilled before serving, while the meats and mushrooms are piping hot, creating another contrast for the senses.
&amp;SUN_DINNER_SPECIAL foo=The dinner special is an Australian lamb &quot;roast dinner&quot; meal -- as is still regularly served for Sunday family meals. A leg of lamb has been roasted and sliced thinly to display the prized medium-rare level of doneness. Roasted potato wedges cooked in the same pan as the lamb have been drizzled with melted herb butter. Next to the potatoes, a salad of crunchy mixed greens, tomatoes, and mushrooms has been lightly tossed with the tangy house vinaigrette dressing. Bowls of brown gravy and mint sauce are included on the side. Dessert is Pavlova, a sugary vanilla-flavored meringue baked into a stiff, lightly browned mound. In the hollowed center, sliced and chunked fruits rest in a layer of whipped cream -- kiwi, passionfruit, strawberries, mango, and star fruit.

&amp;KENDRA here=Kendra is a short, curvily-built African-American woman in her early twenties. She has relatively pale skin, like cream with coffee added for color. Her pale golden eyes give her expression a cat-like intensity. Her nose is short and rather flat, sprinkled with dark brown freckles. Long, high cheekbones and naturally pink lips balance a strong chin. She has tightly-curled black hair that's been trimmed close to her scalp, framing the purity of her features. Her full-bosomed figure is shown to advantage in a snug sleeveless linen top and matching pants. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;The Mariner's Rest&quot;. A bold black tribal-band tattoo encircles each of her forearms.
&amp;KENNETH here=Kenneth is a slim multi-racial man in his late forties or possibly early fifties. Deep golden skin and exotic features emphasize his blended ethnicities, as does his shoulder-length cloak of silky black hair. His nose is long and blade-sharp. High cheekbones and full lips balance a square chin. Cool, almost serpentine, light brown eyes regard the world with calm detachment. He wears a pair of twill pants and a short-sleeved knit top. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;The Mariner's Rest&quot;.
&amp;KENDIS here=Kendis is a waifishly-thin, short girl in her late teens or early twenties, who speaks with more than a hint of an Irish brogue. A curly mop of golden-blond hair frames large cornflower-blue eyes. Softly rounded cheeks and curved lips balance a pointed chin. She's gangly enough to appear to still have a few inches of growth to add to her height, before she'll start to fill out in other directions. Her petite figure is shown to advantage in an unstructured sleeveless linen top and matching pants. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;The Mariner's Rest&quot;. A series of Celtic knotwork bands stained in blue woad dye spiral up each of her arms.
&amp;KENNA here=Kenna is a gracefully-ageless pale woman of average height. Her greying light brown hair is drawn into a bun, away from her cool, serene features. Manicured eyebrows arch over large oval eyes the color of fine carnelians. She has an aquiline nose, sharp cheekbones, and a budlike mouth. Each of her features is delicate, but, in sharp relief. Ornamental braids twisted with green and gold beads provide a decorative touch to her hairstyle. Her slim figure is shown to advantage in an flattering sanded silk top and matching skirt. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;The Mariner's Rest&quot;. She is marked in blue woad pigment with flowing frond designs on the backs of her hands, and in a collar-design around her neck.
&amp;KENDALL here=Kendall is a short, plump, copper-haired young woman in her twenties. She has slightly darker skin than most redheads, tanned to a light golden brown. Her eyes are very blue, and very round. Rounded cheeks, an upturned nose, and a full mouth complete her squirrelishly-cheerful features. Two ponytails of very curly hair froth down to her waist, with a fringe of bangs across her forehead. She's very short, not anywhere near five feet tall even with shoes on, and her perfect posture only seems to emphasize her small stature. She weighs more than the fashionable ideal, as lush and ripe as a summer peach. Her softly-fleshed figure is shown to advantage in a fitted short-sleeved linen top and matching loose pants. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;The Mariner's Rest&quot;.
&amp;KENNSINGTON here=Kennsington is a tall, rangy young man with the lean, hungry-eyed look of someone still growing. He has short wavy brown hair, as full and fluffy as thistledown. Slightly-tilted brown eyes topped with nearly black eyebrows are girlishly oversized in his face. His nose and mouth seem sketched into place, almost incomplete when contrasted with those large eyes. His flat young muscles ripple with potential under gypsy-brown skin. Large hands and feet are another indication that he's still growing. He wears a pair of twill pants and a short-sleeved knit top. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;The Mariner's Rest&quot;. The back of each of his hands is tattooed with a rather crude design of a stylized eye circled by pointed stars.
&amp;TRISHA here=Trisha is a pretty young woman with fine-boned, Celtic-looking features and very white skin. A soft cloud of long auburn curls frames boldly-lined sultry eyes as green as new leaves. Her small nose is slightly upturned, and sprinkled with pale golden freckles. Softly rounded cheeks and full lips balance a curved chin. Her hair has been caught up in a topknot with a barette marked with Celtic key patterns -- it tumbles past her shoulders almost to her tiny waist.%r[space(5)]Trisha speaks with a mild southern accent. She wears clothing suitable to the season.
&amp;TRISTAN here=Tristan is a hansome man who looks boyish at first glance, but is probably at least thirty (or older) upon closer examination. Buff-blond hair falls to his shoulders framing fine blue eyes with thick golden-brown lashes. Strong cheekbones and a sensual mouth balance a square chin. His long pale hair gives him a rather roguish 'Viking' aire, complimented by a somewhat darker goatee. He's very wide-shouldered with a broad chest, narrowing into lean hips and somewhat thin legs. All his strength seems to be centered in his upper body. A Scottish bull has been tattooed on his left tricep, while an Irish lion-headed knotwork band circles his right forearm.%r[space(5)]Tristan speaks with more than a hint of an Irish brogue. He wears clothing suitable to the season.
