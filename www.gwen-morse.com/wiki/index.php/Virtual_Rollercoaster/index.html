@Desc Virtual Rollercoaster=%r[space(5)]This is a snub-nosed steel box with sleek rounded edges making it look more like the body from a shuttle craft. The back of the box is attached to a thick steel beam with a universal joint and that beam itself is attached to a small winch. Judging from the construction, this allows the box to be raised, lowered, and turned in about half of a full sphere of motion. The front has a thin slit which opens to reveal four bucket seats with shoulder supports looking very much like some sort of amusement park ride. On each seat is a virtual reality helmet.%r%r[space(5)]A sign next to the ride reads%r[space(15)]Do not try this ride if:&#160;%r[space(15)]* You under the age of consent as per FSP regulations,%r[space(15)]* You are pregnant,%r[space(15)]* You are subject to epilepsy, or%r[space(15)]* You have a history of heart disease.%r%r[center(&lt;To ride the virtual roller coaster 'enter virtual rollercoaster'.&gt;,79)]%r
@Idesc Virtual Rollercoaster=%r[space(5)]You fit snugly into one of the four soft black scaled-leather seats of the Virtual Rollercoaster. You can see that once the opening is closed, you won't have much room to move around but between the harness over your shoulders and the virtual helmet, you wouldn't be able to move much, anyway.%r[space(5)]If you want to leave once the ride has started, you must 'halt' the show.
&amp;INME Virtual Rollercoaster=[or(strmatch(lcon(me),%#),strmatch(#10661,%#))]
&amp;ANIMATION_A1 Virtual Rollercoaster=The black image before you clears to a pretty realistic scene of a roller coaster track stretching in front of you. If you want to focus on it as computer generated then yes, you can see it is just really good graphics. But let your mind go and accept and you will see yourself there, looking out at glowing light blue tracks in a dark sky of glittering stars. Look left and right and you see more stars and even a pink nebula. Then you feel the roller coaster lurch a little as the tracks start moving under you. A light pressure on your back suggests you are rising up the track.
&amp;ANIMATION_A2 Virtual Rollercoaster=The tracks below you fall away as your incline gets steeper and steeper and then...you tip forward as the tracks reemerge, plummeting straight down. Held up by the harness the tracks start to shoot by and then you see your guiding path twist into an impossibly tight screw. A second later you twist as well, pressing hard to the right as the stars and glowing blue rails pass above and below. Then, still turning, you tilt up to see a rush of fire coming towards you. The boiling cloud of red and orange engulfs you, rushing past you in a pyromaniac's dream come true. As if this was not wild enough, you emerge from the cloud to find its source: a huge neon green dragon with flaming red eyes. It flaps its wings as you now move through a huge cavernous space of slowly flowing lava. But more distressing is that track. It is now a fluid molten gold color and the car jerks up and down as if it were getting ready to fall through. But even that is not the most distressing part. What is truly distressing is that the end of the track hangs in mid air, and the dragon is flying towards it, with gaping mouth passing over its very end!
&amp;ANIMATION_A3 Virtual Rollercoaster=The tracks inexorably lead towards the great maw of the fire-breathing lizard. As you look up or down, you see gleaming silver teeth the size of skyscrapers pass all around you. Tumbling up and down along its neck, you move between glowing jewels of every color before the throat opens into a sargasso of ruined ships. Electric blue glowing waves loom and though unfelt they toss you left and right, up and down. You tumble onwards leaving the sea into pure blackness except for the glowing track which was gone, but has now reappeared. If you choose to look behind you, you will see a straight track in the black void. In front of you you see along the path a glowing golden ring, so far off it appears very small.
&amp;ANIMATION_A4 Virtual Rollercoaster=The ring hovers in the distance, growing only slightly before it rushes towards you. Behind the golden ring is a red one, then blue, then purple. You follow the tracks as the rings blur around you, moving faster and faster. You see through the rings a tube of colored sections, presumably your future path. It rises and falls, twists and turns as you are apparently following its path very accurately. The rings fall away after exhilarating moments and you find yourself back in space. Stars of a hundred colors dot your sight as huge glittering chunks of ice move around you.
&amp;ANIMATION_A5 Virtual Rollercoaster=You yaw and pith, rise and fall, dodging the ice blocks that scintillate in bright primary colors. Falling and rising, you miraculously move through the storm without being hit. Having cleared the storm you find a planet looming in front of you, and growing larger...you are falling towards it! It gets larger and larger; then you are surrounded by clouds. Only the track can be seen in the pearly white mist but the path of the roller coaster is still a turbulent one, kinking and curving, rising and falling, but always ultimately leading you downwards.
&amp;ANIMATION_A6 Virtual Rollercoaster=You break through the clouds over a large city. The city seems to attract a lot of aircraft, for in the night skies dozens, maybe even hundreds, of red and blue blinking dots swarm. You take evasive maneuvers, twisting and turning to fall safely through the air net until you see individual buildings. The primary structure of a granite-faced spaceport is barely avoided by the path of the track and then the pavement is inches beneath you. With dizzying speeds you slalom through the spaceport complex, dodging low building and landing craft. Double doors open and you leap and fall over startled pedestrians until exiting through another set of double doors. You find yourself slowing at last, settling down into a pleasant tropical courtyard. Cheerful native music is piped into the roller coaster as the projections in your helmet go blank.%r[center(&lt;OOC: There will be a short pause and then the ride will eject you. Please just sit tight.&gt;,79)]
&amp;ANIMATION_A7 Virtual Rollercoaster=The roller coaster opens and you feel gentle hands taking the helmet off you before releasing you from the harness. The attendant asks you if you are okay to walk and, helps you get out of the 'ride'.
&amp;CREDITS Virtual Rollercoaster=Originally coded by Winston@Denver (WoD MUSH). Animation &quot;A&quot; written by the same. Update to +buy code and cleanup by Gwen Morse (http:www.geocities.com/goldmooneachna/mush.html).

&amp;ANIMATION_B1 Virtual Rollercoaster=The darkness suddenly comes alive with swirling stars all around you. Swooping through space in free fall and silence. The stars spread out as the angle tightens in on one system with the single star, and the orbiting planets. Slowly the view moves towards one. A medium sized world, and even from orbit it is obvious that this is a world full of technology, and not many natural places. The voice, deep and resonating, booms around you like the voice of God. &quot;Welcome to Nios.&quot;
&amp;ANIMATION_B2 Virtual Rollercoaster=The angle moves in on a large city. &quot;This is the capital city of Nios, where both the king and the head singer to the dead live.&quot; Heard all around is singing in Latin, a chorus of the voices of the best-respected singers. The view swoops onto the street with hundreds of people bustling between very tall buildings that show obvious signs of high technology. Finally the angle tightens and pushes through a door before spreading out to surround you again.
&amp;ANIMATION_B3 Virtual Rollercoaster=The room you end up in is a large assembly line. It is completely automated. Bustling about the room are perhaps five humans, broad in body, and pale of skin. The voice booms around you again as sparks fly in your general direction, and metal is welded to metal, as well as circuit boards assembled by mechanical arms. &quot;Nios is a leading world in technological development. Though not one of the largest worlds it does have one of the highest rates of robotics manufacture. Also hailed as one of the best for tech and mechanical building. If you have the best most likely all or part of it was built here.&quot;
&amp;ANIMATION_B4 Virtual Rollercoaster=The view moves to that of the street again, and swoops slowly through an amusement park. The rides are smooth and perfect. All of the concession stands seem to be manned by mechanical men. Thousands of humans scream in joy as the high-speed roller coasters take them on the ride of their lives. &quot;That is not to say that the people of this world do not enjoy themselves. Work hard so you can play hard is the global motto of this technical paradise.&quot; The voice continues as the view moves quickly through a line and then gives the first hand experience of one of the heart stopping rides.
&amp;ANIMATION_B5 Virtual Rollercoaster=Again the camera is on the move. It swoops in on the one building on the planet that seems less than fifty stories tall. &quot;The royal castle.&quot; The voice intones as the view moves at a brisk walk through the halls and past pictures of the previous kings and queens. Moving passed lavishly decorated rooms, and finally into one that is the throne room. It looks much like a medieval throne room except it is made of steel and glass. The noise of the busy courtiers fills the air with a buzz as they try to get the attention of the purple clad king. The voice continues. &quot;The government on this planet is feudal. One of the two things that stand out in such an advanced world.&quot;
&amp;ANIMATION_B6 Virtual Rollercoaster=The view fades to the inside of a church. You again hear voices singing in Latin. Though this time you can see the choir that sings. Clad in black robes with red sashes, led by an older man in a red robe and black sash. The congregation is huge, at least five hundred strong. They are all silent as they listen to the powerful singing. &quot;Rivaling the king is the head singer. He leads the church of the singers to the dead. Not only do they oversee the spiritual life of the people but they perform the most beautiful funerals, and exorcisms in all the FSP.&quot; A quick pull out of the church until you are in orbit again. &quot;So come to Nios on your next vacation.&quot; Slowly everything fades back to darkness.
&amp;ANIMATION_B7 Virtual Rollercoaster=The roller coaster opens and you feel gentle hands taking the helmet off you before releasing you from the harness. The attendant asks you if you are okay to walk and, helps you get out of the 'ride'.
&amp;ACTION_1 Virtual Rollercoaster=The virtual roller coaster just sits there a moment and then the universal joint tips the box upwards as the supporting bar raises as well. The box moves slowly but gracefully at least six feet off the ground.
&amp;ACTION_2 Virtual Rollercoaster=The virtual roller coaster suddenly tilts down and drops so that the front edge of the box hovers barely an inch off the ground. Rising slowly, it starts to spin, rather quickly. Round and round it goes.
&amp;ACTION_3 Virtual Rollercoaster=The virtual roller coaster continues it gyrations, moving up and down, left and right, and spinning first clockwise, then counterclockwise.
&amp;ACTION_5 Virtual Rollercoaster=The virtual roller coaster levels for a moment, then returns to its violent movements.
&amp;ACTION_7 Virtual Rollercoaster=The virtual roller coaster makes one last grand series of dips, rises, twists, and turns, and then settles down to a halt, lowering back to the ground. The attendant opens the box, removes the headgear and harnesses from those inside, and then the occupant(s) exit.
