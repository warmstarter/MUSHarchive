@dig/teleport Back Yard -- Saint Brigid's Fire
@Desc here=%r[space(5)]This yard is dominated by an overarching aluminum frame formed into a curving hexagon with a diameter of about twenty feet. [switch(u(season),WINTER,During these cold months it acts as the framework for a giant hive-shaped glass-walled greenhouse.,TRAN-AUTUMN,During these cold months it acts as the framework for a giant hive-shaped glass-walled greenhouse.,TRAN-SPRING,During these cold months it acts as the framework for a giant hive-shaped glass-walled greenhouse.,During these warm months it fences in a knot garden with symmetrical planting beds and narrow gravelled paths for navigation.)] ('+view here/knot-garden'). On far the side of the lot, there's a rectangular greenhouse, the glass set in place year-round ('+view here/glasshouse').%r%r[space(5)]A climbing rose sends vines around a trellis arcing over the entrance to a tiny tool shed ('+view here/shed'). [switch(u(season),SPRING,{The climbing rose vine surrounds its trellis with a leafy green cloak with traces of lemony-yellow buds in defiance of the changable Colorado season. },SUMMER,{The climbing rose vine is in full bloom, the flowers a stunning shade of pale yellow tipped with salmon pink. },AUTUMN,{The climbing rose is firmly entwined around its trellis, the last hardy yellow-tipped-with-salmon blossoms defying the late season, while the rest have aged to rosehips. },WINTER,{Tangled, brownish wintering vines cling tenaciously to the trellis, mulched heavily around their base. })] The whole property is surrounded by chain-link fencing decorated with diagonal slats of white and green. The area is twice the size of most commercial properties in the area, most likely combined into one with a neighboring plot. [switch(u(season-cold),1,{Heat pipes have been sunk throughout the grounds of the yard, to keep the earth from completely freezing over the winter. })] Windchimes by the Green Door tinkle when a breeze taps them together.%r
&amp;GAUNTLET here=6
&amp;SHROUD here=7
&amp;UDESC here=%r[space(5)]You are in an outside area enclosed by an unobtrusive chain-link fence. This is a surprisingly green and glowing nook in the midst of the concrete jungle around. Four dwarf trees grow above wild patches of herbs and shrubs. Each tree is so healthy and full of life, you can almost *see* the roots drawing sustenance from the rich soil as the branches spread out under the light from the sky. Crooked bare patches in the groundcover form natural footpaths through the low plants. Bees, earthworms, butterflies, fireflies, and other bugs all make their homes here. A few exotic faerie-like characters, pixies of some sort, flutter in a solemn dance from plant to plant.%r
&amp;WDESC here=%r[space(5)]You are in an outside area enclosed by a rusty, sagging chain-link fence. Deep furrows and random holes have been deliberatly scratched into the thin, chalky soil. Some holes are half-filled with stagnant pools of water, while others nest vermin of one sort or another. A pile of boards in one corner may be a collapsed struture. The shed door resting flat on top contributes to that impression.%r

@Succ here=[space(5)]There are things to '+view here'. There are some small benches and tables set up as 'places'.%r
&amp;VIEW_SHED here=%r[space(5)]This small shed is immaculately organized. Every tool stored within looks almost new - each snip oiled and sharpened, each shovel wiped clean, each pronged tool resting in its own place. A long green hose is neatly coiled in one corner, next to a pair of metal watering cans. Cardboard planters are stacked on a high shelf, out of the way of items needing daily use. Rolls of tape and other 'odds-and-ends' are in a small bin attached to the door. Several pairs of dirty gardening gloves are the only sign these tools might actually be used.%r%r[space(5)]When not in use, the shed is locked with a cheap 3-number combination lock on a bicycle chain - similar to those found in any hardware store.%r
&amp;VIEW_SUNDIAL here=[switch(and(neq(match(u(placenums),*%#*,|),4),u(season-cold)),1,{%rPlease enter the knot-garden greenhouse ('join #4') to look at things inside it.%r},{%r[space(5)]This is a tall sundial in the center of the knot garden. It's cast from reddish bronze that is slowly aging to a subtle greenish patina. Traditional Celtic knotwork decorates the center of the 24-hour dial numbered in Roman numerals. One indicator is marked for daytime viewing, another to track the nocturnal hours. An inscription around the four edges reads:%r%r[space(10)]&quot;Now Sweetly Lies Old Ireland,%r[space(10)]Emerald Green Beyond the Foam,&#160;%r[space(10)]Awakening Sweet Memories,%r[space(10)]Calling the Heart Back Home.&quot;%r%r[space(5)]The worked-iron tripod base has been weatherproofed with a black powdercoat finish.%r%r[space(5)]Nestled in the soil around the outside of the nasturtium bed about the base of the sundial are naturally-colored smooth and flat stones marking the 4 points of the compass. South, East, and West are each white, while North is a soft reddish-orange ochre color.%r})]

Moisture from inside the glasshouse has beaded into a fog on the glass making it impossible to see inside. Please enter the glasshouse ('join #5') to '+view' inside it.%r},{%r[space(5)]The interior is warm to the point of hot, and wet no matter what the weather is outside, almost assaulting to the senses. There's a cornucopia of smells, some bitter, some sweet, some heavy and cloying, other so light as to be barely noticed. This is an orderly green house. The wood chip floor covers raw dirt. Plants grow in neatly arranged raised rows of wood boxes. There seems to be a wide selection of everything: flowers, herbs, grasses, small trees, and representatives of every other sort. To one end is a small desk which holds several journals, probably for tracking growths and strains, and equipment for drying, harvesting, cross-pollinating, and other esoteric uses.%r})]

&amp;STORE-DESC-MON Text holder=Two silvery-white candles burn in bright brass sconces on the wall behind the glass counter. Incense holders at the base of the sconces burn a combination of Lavender, Ylang-Ylang, and Bergamot, altogether a balancing and calming blend.
&amp;STORE-DESC-TUE Text holder=Five red candles burn in bright brass sconces on the wall behind the glass counter. Incense holders at the base of the sconces burn a combination of Patchouli, Pine, and Vetiver, altogether an energetic and mentally stimulating blend.
&amp;STORE-DESC-WED Text holder=Eight orange candles burn in bright brass sconces on the wall behind the glass counter. Incense holders at the base of the sconces burn a combination of Tangerine, Peppermint, and Rosemary, altogether a cheerful and energizing blend.
&amp;STORE-DESC-THU Text holder=Four royal-blue candles burn in bright brass sconces on the wall behind the glass counter. Incense holders at the base of the sconces burn a combination of Allspice, Bay Rum, and Rosemary, altogether a comforting and appetizing blend.
&amp;STORE-DESC-FRI Text holder=Seven green candles burn in bright brass sconces on the wall behind the glass counter. Incense holders at the base of the sconces burn a combination of Jasmine, Patchouli, and Rosemary, altogether a sensual and refreshing blend.
&amp;STORE-DESC-SAT Text holder=Three black candles burn in bright brass sconces on the wall behind the glass counter. Incense holders at the base of the sconces burn a combination of Dragon's Blood and Myrrh, altogether a somber and darkly-mystical attuning blend.
&amp;STORE-DESC-SUN Text holder=One golden-yellow candle burns in one of the bright brass sconces on the wall behind the glass counter. Incense holders at the base of the sconces burn a combination of Saffron, Curry spice and other Indian fragrances, altogether an exotic and tongue-tingling blend.
&amp;HERB-DESC-SPRING Text holder=[u(herb-top)] Bright yellow daffodils, fragrant hyacinth, cheerful crocuses, and some other -- less-easily idenfified -- bulb flowers bloom as well. Pansies, violets, and lobelia carpet their spokes. A few herbs are just beginning to bloom -- lavender, sage, chives, and rosemary. The nasturtiums around the sundial have buds in the trailing growth. The tarragon and other herbs which slept dormant over the winter are sending forth new, bright green shoots.
&amp;HERB-DESC-SUMMER Text holder=[u(herb-top)] The open garden is a mass of colors and scents. The nasturtiums make a bright yellow and orange mound about the sundial, a few thin spots showing where the leaves and flowers have been harvested. A whole bed of plants for teas can be seen: chamomile, bee balm, catnip, and sweet woodruff among them. Some beds are simple pairs of herbs: sage and rue, coriander and dill, the various mints and parsley. The summer flowers present a riot of sensations. Lantana spreads out bright gold and magenta many-petaled flowers. Alyssum in its gradiated whites, pinks, and purples, grows nearby. Poppies perfume the air and grow rich red and deep purple. Silvery white-pink apple blossom petals drift to the ground from time to time. Iris and daylilies alternate along the rim of the aluminum frame.
&amp;HERB-DESC-WINTER Text holder=[u(herb-top)] Even in this season when most plants are dormant, fresh herbs are available from this greenhouse garden. Deep green rosemary, the lighter green bay leaves, several varieties of thymes, lovage, and a bit of cinnamon bark can be collected. The dwarf apple and nutmeg trees have no leaves. Most of the shrub-type plants have been pruned back for the season. A heavy base of mulch helps keep the sheltered plants from freezing completely. Layered planting boxes are supported by a series of shelves along one section of the framework. These support out-of-season and exotic plants that flourish in the relative warmth of the greenhouse.
&amp;HERB-DESC-AUTUMN Text holder=[u(herb-top)] The fertile days of summer have ripened this open garden to full autumnal splendor. Apple tree boughs bend under the weight of full-sized fruit. The dwarf nutmeg carries a heavy load of wrinkled, solid seeds. One bed is filled with all varieties of alliums: garlic, both sweet and hot onions, and the blooming varieties of every color. This is the season to harvest and dry herbs for the winter -- dill, sage, savory, marjoram and more. The seed pods of the nasturtiums around the sundial can still be collected. On dry days, golden pollen sifts along the gravel paths like fairy dust when the air moves.
&amp;HERB-DESC-TRAN-SPRING Text holder=[u(herb-top)] Even in the pre-spring season when most plants are dormant, fresh herbs are available from this greenhouse garden. Deep green rosemary, the lighter green bay leaves, several varieties of thymes, lovage, and a bit of cinnamon bark can be collected. The first bulbs of the season poke up spear-shaped leaves. Delicate snowdrops and crocus bloom amidst mauve and lilac hesias. The dwarf apple and nutmeg trees have no leaves. Some plants have been pruned back to prepare for spring growth. A heavy base of mulch helps keep the sheltered plants from freezing completely. Layered planting boxes are supported by a series of shelves along one section of the framework. These support out-of-season and exotic plants that are blooming in the relative warmth of the greenhouse.
&amp;HERB-DESC-TRAN-AUTUMN Text holder=[u(herb-top)] The glass of the greenhouse moderates the temperature of this area, sheltering the growing plants from the changable seasonal weather. Apple tree boughs bend under the weight of full-sized fruit. The dwarf nutmeg carries a heavy load of wrinkled, solid seeds. One bed is filled with all varieties of alliums: garlic, both sweet and hot onions, and the blooming varieties of every color. This is the season to harvest and dry herbs for the winter -- dill, sage, savory, marjoram and more. Layered planting boxes are supported by a series of shelves along one section of the framework. These support out-of-season and exotic plants that are sprouting in the moist warmth of the greenhouse.
&amp;HERB-TOP Text holder=This is a knot garden with symmetrical planting beds and narrow gravelled paths for navigation. It's shaped like a wagon-wheel with a sundial at the center, low growing herbs as the spokes, and four beds on the rim which have a small tree centered in each -- a bay tree, a dwarf cinnamon, a dwarf nutmeg, and a dwarf apple. Shrub and hedge-like herbs surround the trees. Outlining the wheel is a ring of bulbs.%r%r[space(5)]

&amp;KENDRA Text holder=Kendra is a short, curvily-built African-American woman in her early twenties. She has relatively pale skin, like cream with coffee added for color. Her pale golden eyes give her expression a cat-like intensity. Her nose is short and rather flat, sprinkled with dark brown freckles. Long, high cheekbones and naturally pink lips balance a strong chin. She has tightly-curled black hair that's been trimmed close to her scalp, framing the purity of her features. Her full-bosomed figure is shown to advantage in a snug sleeveless linen top and matching pants. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;Saint Brigid's Fire&quot;. A bold black tribal-band tattoo encircles each of her forearms.
&amp;KENNETH Text holder=Kenneth is a slim multi-racial man in his late forties or possibly early fifties. Deep golden skin and exotic features emphasize his blended ethnicities, as does his shoulder-length cloak of silky black hair. His nose is long and blade-sharp. High cheekbones and full lips balance a square chin. Cool, almost serpentine, light brown eyes regard the world with calm detachment. He wears a pair of twill pants and a short-sleeved knit top. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;Saint Brigid's Fire&quot;.
&amp;KENDIS Text holder=Kendis is a waifishly-thin, short girl in her late teens or early twenties, who speaks with more than a hint of an Irish brogue. A curly mop of golden-blond hair frames large cornflower-blue eyes. Softly rounded cheeks and curved lips balance a pointed chin. She's gangly enough to appear to still have a few inches of growth to add to her height, before she'll start to fill out in other directions. Her petite figure is shown to advantage in an unstructured sleeveless linen top and matching pants. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;Saint Brigid's Fire&quot;. A series of Celtic knotwork bands stained in blue woad dye spiral up each of her arms.
&amp;KENNA Text holder=Kenna is a gracefully-ageless pale woman of average height. Her greying light brown hair is drawn into a bun, away from her cool, serene features. Manicured eyebrows arch over large oval eyes the color of fine carnelians. She has an aquiline nose, sharp cheekbones, and a budlike mouth. Each of her features is delicate, but, in sharp relief. Ornamental braids twisted with green and gold beads provide a decorative touch to her hairstyle. Her slim figure is shown to advantage in an flattering sanded silk top and matching skirt. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;Saint Brigid's Fire&quot;. She is marked in blue woad pigment with flowing frond designs on the backs of her hands, and in a collar-design around her neck.
&amp;KENDALL Text holder=Kendall is a short, plump, copper-haired young woman in her twenties. She has slightly darker skin than most redheads, tanned to a light golden brown. Her eyes are very blue, and very round. Rounded cheeks, an upturned nose, and a full mouth complete her squirrelishly-cheerful features. Two ponytails of very curly hair froth down to her waist, with a fringe of bangs across her forehead. She's very short, not anywhere near five feet tall even with shoes on, and her perfect posture only seems to emphasize her small stature. She weighs more than the fashionable ideal, as lush and ripe as a summer peach. Her softly-fleshed figure is shown to advantage in a fitted short-sleeved linen top and matching loose pants. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;Saint Brigid's Fire&quot;.
&amp;KENNSINGTON Text holder=Kennsington is a tall, rangy young man with the lean, hungry-eyed look of someone still growing. He has short wavy brown hair, as full and fluffy as thistledown. Slightly-tilted brown eyes topped with nearly black eyebrows are girlishly oversized in his face. His nose and mouth seem sketched into place, almost incomplete when contrasted with those large eyes. His flat young muscles ripple with potential under gypsy-brown skin. Large hands and feet are another indication that he's still growing. He wears a pair of twill pants and a short-sleeved knit top. The top has a pocket embroidered with the words &quot;Saint Brigid's Fire&quot;. The back of each of his hands is tattooed with a rather crude design of a stylized eye circled by pointed stars.

@Desc here=%r[space(5)]This store is stocked almost to the point of being cluttered. Nearly ceiling high medicine drawers cover two walls, the fronts neatly labeled with the fresh or dry herbal component stored within. Each high unit is topped with pots sheltering live plants for sale. An arrangement of herbal teas, essential oils, and stick and resin incenses is displayed on a square table draped with a lace cloth with a sign that reads &quot;Seasonal Special: [switch(u(season),SPRING,Spring is for Lovers,SUMMER,Summer is for Athletics and Weight Adjustment,AUTUMN,Fall is for Academics and Memory Retention,WINTER,Winter is for Cold and Flu Season)]&quot;.%r%r[space(5)]The entrance wall of the store is made up of bookshelves flanking two lovely pink-glassed bay windows ('+view here/books'). The L-shaped glass counter to one side contains a display of silver, brass, pewter, and cast stone Celtic ornaments ('+view here/counter'). Chairs along the counter allow customers to rest or discuss art comissions or special requests ('+view here/sign'). Behind it is a somewhat open area where the store line and special requests are concocted. [u(#2369/store-desc-[mid(vtime(),0,3)])] The counter holds a basic computer that serves as the cash register.

&amp;VIEW_CEILING here=%r[space(5)]The ceiling is papered in bright primary-colored posters. Most of them seem to have a vaguely similar sun-symbol theme. With a bit of study, you might recognize them as being Celtic triskelles alternated with Romano-Celtic Sulis (sun-symbols). The images are alternated in such a way to map out a large Celtic cross that spreads the length and width of the ceiling. The colors flow in a dominant rainbow from red to yellow to blue to violet-black, with all the corresponding shades gradiating through the center.%r

&amp;VIEW_COUNTER here=%r[space(5)]In the glass display cabinet you can see several blue jewelry trays. Upon them is a range of silver jewelry, several styles and sizes of silver chains, and a range of pendants including several variants of ankhs and pentagrams.%r%r[space(5)]A second level is marked &quot;Custom Work&quot; and has mostly blue trays for silver, with a single tray for gold items. Celtic designs are by far the most common; there are Celtic crosses, and Celtic knotwork is used to form several items such as pentagrams, Stars of David, ankhs, and some non-religious symbols. There are three crucifixes bearing Jesus; though the work is small his expression is clearly of peace and love. A collection of gleaming silver rings are sized to fit a range of fingers. A pair of silver candlesticks bracket this level, fluted and engraved strips of silver coming together to form solid, stable and heavy candle holders.%r%r[space(5)]The final, and smallest level is marked &quot;Work To Order.&quot; Most of the items are marked &quot;Awaiting collection&quot;. This includes a pair of gold bands both sized for small fingers, and both almost identical. Their surface is covered by knotwork designs, making a frame for the phrases &quot;Roberta and Bunny&quot; and &quot;Bunny and Roberta&quot;.%r%r[space(5)]Interspersed among the jewelry are handcarved wooden figurines of animals and people ranging in price from $5 to $100, depending on the individual size and intricacy of the work. A small sign notes the name of the carver, 'Robin', and that commissions are taken upon request.%r
&amp;VIEW_SCREEN-CRONE here=%r[space(5)]This is one panel of a three-panel screen ornamented with Celtic patterns. A canvas painting has been secured to the panel, protected by a layer of glass. Several small, but very detail paintings surround the central focus: an aged woman in her mid fifties. She is wearing a long dress of pale white fabric, with heavy fringes from which blue and green beads hang along with fine golden bells. A raven is embroidered upon the dress, its stylised wings crossing over the breastbone. The woman's face is slender, her cheekbone still sharp, the mouth generous. Time has wrinkled the skin, drawn furrows in the face but there is no loss; time has given this face depth and wisdom rather then coming as an enemy to be fought. Silver-gray hair frames the face, its colour matched in her pale eyes. She holds a bowl out, as if offering it to those who look. The bowl is only one third full. A Celtic cross hangs between her slight breasts, faintly worn but polished, and beautiful.%r%R[space(5)]Of the four smaller works, three focus on the woman in finer detail. The first is the cross where it rests against the dress, every fold painted with fine care, shining against the black and blue of the raven. The second is her eyes; silver gray and almost colourless, but very alive. Webbed with lines, they are alert and alive, watching with good humour and with wisdom in their depths. The third picture is of her hands, cradling the bowl. Wrinkled and aged, but still strong, they hold the bowl with surety. The last of the four surrounding pictures is along the base of the picture; a pattern of fruits rest there, every size and colour from small red cherries, to apples, blackberries and grapes. Delicately signed in one corner of he painting is 'R Hagan, - 2003'.%r
&amp;VIEW_SCREEN-MOTHER here=%r[space(5)]This is one panel of a three-panel screen ornamented with Celtic patterns. A canvas painting has been secured to the panel, protected by a layer of glass. Several small, but very detailed paintings surround the central focus: a woman in her mid-thirties. She is wearing a summer dress, light cotton printed in a pattern of holly flowers, crosses and ivy leaves. The woman's face is slender, her cheekbone still sharp, the mouth generous. Time has touched this face but lightly, faint are the signs of ageing. Worry has not been so gentle; this is a face that is used to worry, for herself and for others. Black hair frames the face, its colour contrasting with her silver-grey eyes. She holds a bowl out, as if offering it to those who look. The bowl is two thirds full of water. A Celtic cross hangs between her slight breasts, finely polished and beautiful.%r%r[space(5)]Of the four smaller works, three focus on the woman in finer detail. The first is the cross where it rests against the fabric, every fold painted with care, shining from polishing against her dress. The second is her eyes; silver grey and almost colourless, but very alive. Touched by worry, they are nonetheless alert and alive, watching with good humour and with wisdom in their depths. The third picture is of her hands, cradling the bowl. Working hands, not soft and pampered, they hold the bowl with surety. The last of the four surrounding pictures is along the base of the picture; a pattern of plants, all growing fruit - not yet ripe, but showing growth. Delicately signed in one corner of he painting is 'R Hagan, - 2003'%r
&amp;VIEW_SCREEN-MAIDEN here=%r[space(5)]This is one panel of a three-panel screen ornamented with Celtic patterns. A canvas painting has been secured to the panel, protected by a layer of glass. This is a bold Caravaggio-style portrait of a petite young woman in her twenties. She's sitting in a blooming herb garden wearing a pale blue sundress, holding a bowl of water which she seems to be offering to the viewer. The artist rendering her slender face, with elfin-sharp cheekbones and a generous mouth, has caught her arresting, almost glacial beauty. There is a hint of changing expressions that make her vivid features come alive with joy or sorrow, warmth or coldness, pleasure or dismissal, depending on your relative perspective. The impression you take away from this painting is veiled unpredictability that lingers long after you forget the exact blue-black shade of her heavy braid of hair or the precise grey-blue of her eyes. An ornate silver Celtic cross on a simple chain hangs between her slight breasts. A signature in one corner reads 'D. O'Haghean - 1976'.&#160;%r%r[space(5)]Collected under the painting is a circle of small detail sketches focusing on individual aspects within the greater work. One is the ornate Celtic cross, each interlaced fold sketched in bold strokes; next is the expression in her pale eyes, a playfully changeable mood frozen on paper; after that comes a detail of fine-boned hands cradling the bowl of water; last is a series of flowers from the garden lined neatly along the bottom of the page. A signature in one corner reads 'D. O'Haghean - 1976'.%r
&amp;VIEW_CELTIC-SCREEN here=%r[space(5)]This is a tall, heavy, three-panel Victorian dressing screen. The frame is constructed of polished ebony, while the individual panels are wood painted with fanciful images, alternating with bare sections of mellowed golden oak. The whole is broken down into visual sections by thin rows of ebony. Featured on the painted sections are small and large Irish faeries, a representation of Saint Patrick bargaining with God for Ireland, the triple battle goddesses with their company of crows, all in a landscape of rolling misty green hillsides.%r%r[space(5)]A handmade wreath of dried flowers and fragrant herbs has been carefully draped over one top corner of the screen. The herbs scent the air in this part of the room. There's a small card attached to the wreath that reads &quot;In Memorium&quot;. The card is unsigned. On a small table, a mourning remembrance candle burns under glass.%r%r[space(5)]Some bare oak sections have been covered with canvas paintings then topped with glass.

@dig/teleport Living Area -- Saint Brigid's Fire
@Desc here=%r[space(5)]The upper floor of the building has been crafted in an open-plan design that maximizes the efficiency of every inch of space. The floor is light golden oak waxed to a low shine. A window looks out upon a small backyard garden, and another over the main street out front. In the living room area, a buff leather sofa sits before a glass-topped coffee table which rests on a brightly colored and patterned rug. There is an oversized rocking chair draped with a colorful comforter, and a large circle of chairs makes a conversational cluster. A brick fireplace is built into one corner. Through an arch up one step is the galley kitchen, with a gas stove and modern appliances. Between the living area and the kitchen is a breakfast nook with a small oak table and four ladder-back chairs. A door tucked discreetly to one side of the kitchen appears to be a bathroom. Two other doors seem to lead to bedrooms.%r%r[space(5)]Pots of green growing herbs are secured on almost every horizontal surface, battling for space with an old and well-thumbed collection of hardcover books. A hint of old incense hangs in the air. A few six-packs of different flavors of generic-brand soda cans have been heaped into an uneven stack along one section of wall. Many of the red, green, and white cans are crushed or dented in places, but, they all seem to still be unopened.%r
@Succ here=[space(5)]There are things to '+view here', including several clusters of paintings and drawings on the walls. You may be interested in one of the 'places'. The Oak Door opens on a staircase that leads back down to the main store level.%r
&amp;VIEW_ART1 here=%r[space(5)]Picture 1: This is a watercolor of several tall, slender, purple-and-gold iris blossoms in a cream-colored vase. There are perhaps a half-dozen of the noble flowers, the bright colors of the blossoms contrasting with the dark green stems and leaves. The style is loose and flowing, complimenting the flowers nicely. The deep green, vivid purple-and-gold, and pale creams have been reproduced in the weaving of the small rug under the coffee table. The picture is signed &quot;D. O'Haghean - 1983&quot;.%r%r[space(5)]Picture 2: This is a woodblocked print of a dark and rather foreboding-looking forest. A young girl, all alone, wanders blithely down a narrow path. The artist has managed to convery the girl's total lack of fear or concern walking along. The picture is harshly black-and-white, with only a bit of color added to fill in the girl's red cloak. It's signed &quot;D. O'Haghean - 1980&quot;.%r%r[space(5)]Picture 3: This is a color photograph of an underwater scene. Several oddly-colored fish, in striking colors that range from shocking pink to bright orange, swim lazily in and around tough-looking green and brown aquatic grasses. A few bi-valves are half-burrowed into the sandy bottom, their shells open slightly to the current. Lurking in the backround is a rather ridiculous-looking fish, striped like the others, but with shades of blue and green. It appears to be trying to blend in with the rest of the school, unsucessfully. The photo is framed in a brushed silver frame.%r

&amp;VIEW_ART2 here=%r[space(5)]This is a pastel sketch of a nude young woman drawn from behind -- reclining on a couch padded with rich metallic brocade fabric. The articulation of most of the bones in her slight body can be made out, softened only by the hipshot curve of her bottom, and soft thighs. One arm supports her head, buried in a heavy mass of black hair, the other is draped idly along the sharp curve of waist to hip -- the same curve echoed in the upturned fingers of her hand. The picture is a study of sharp contrasts; white skin to black hair, the open sensuality of the figure to the mysteriously hidden face, blemishless skin to deeply folded fabric. A signature in one corner reads 'D. O'Haghean - 1975'.%r%r[space(5)]Sharp charcoal lines capture the jagged outline of a pointy-chinned, androgynous face, and oversized, pale eyes. There is something wild and fey in the subject's expression, the haunted eyes of a changeling raised by humankind. It's not elf-like in the manner of a fictional character, the ears are rounded and the bone structure is just coarse enough to seem human. But, those large colorless eyes, scored underneath with deep shadows, long for some trace of magic this harshly mundane world can never provide. A few streaks of greenish colored pencil provide a hint of leaves in the background. A signature in one corner reads 'D. O'Haghean - 1975'.%r
&amp;JUDGENOTE_LIBRARY here=A mage's library is stored on the shelves, mixed in with regular, non-Magickal tomes. The total library rating is: 2 for the Celestial Chorus, broken down into the following books -- Spirit: 4 // Corr: 2 // Mind: 2 // Life: 2 // Prime: 1
&amp;VIEW_LIBRARY here=%r[space(5)]Books in English and Irish-Gaelic have been crammed into a variety of bookshelves throughout the house. Many are quite old looking, including a Carlough family bible that's at least 200 years old. Most of the books detail herbs, herbalism, and Celtic/Christian spirituality, a few others are Victorian scholarly works on different topics, while still others are old leatherbound editions of classic works. There are quite a few first editions tucked away on the shelves, and the library is quite valuable for such a modest domicile.%r
&amp;GAUNTLET here=7
&amp;VIEW_ART3 here=%r[space(5)]A young, and very naked woman sprawls on her back along one edge of a disorganized bed. Her head is turned towards the viewer, eyes half-closed and lips parted. The heavy light of the sun pressing through the window paints stripes of gold along her creamy white skin. Thick masses of hair spread around her head like a black halo. Not a strand of it touches her skin. One arm and one leg each drape languidly off the side of the bed, as if the exhaustion of the woman extends to even lifting her limbs to the softness of the bed. Pale pink nipples and the touch of black between her legs provide the only other traces of color in the pencil sketch filled in with watercolors. A signature in one corner reads 'D. O'Haghean - 1976'.

&amp;VIEW_ART4 here=%r[space(5)]This is a collection of old and faded snapshots, that seem to cover a span of about ten years. Each has been snugged up to the next to form a collage of sorts. Many of the photos show damaged buildings in the background, lines of people who all look tired and careworn, and give the impression of poor living conditions. Most of these warzone settings are cupped in green hills glowing with health. There are many pictures of a thirty-ish birdlike dark-daired woman with a tall man, a moderately handsome blond fellow with a beard, at least a decade older than her. Both are posed with their arms around a mixed-up gaggle of fey-looking children ranging in ages from three to ten, too many to be their own brood, the adult expressions shining with love and fierce protectiveness. Something about their faces say they both have hearts big enough for as many orphans as they can find. In all the pictures, that couple has armbands each marked with a large red cross. Some are of the man caught painting, it might be possible to make out that one or two of the canvases he was working on hang on the walls nearby. About a half-dozen images feature the dark-haired woman in front of famous Irish churhes and landmarks, dressed in what might be her Sunday best for the early 1980's and still wearing armbands.%r%r[space(5)]Next to a closet door is a charcoal sketch of a sixty-ish woman sitting cross-legged, surrounded by framed pictures of smiling, childish faces. A few of the more youthful members of the Denver population may be recognizable. A frame cradled in her arms outlines the adult portrait of Roberta Hagan. The drawing is quite well done, fantastic really considering the materials used. The artist managed to capture the warmth of the woman's expression along with recognizable features in some of the faces portrayed in the pictures. The softly blurred background is mostly unrecognizable but a shaft of sunlight comes from some unseen window to capture her in a circle of light. It is signed 'Alexander McMasters -- 5/8/00'&#160;%r
&amp;VIEW_BONSAI here=%r[space(5)]Rising up from an pale-green ceramic pot is a young bonsai, its branches reaching up and out. Small, light green leaves burst forth from the upper branches, while larger ones cling to the few lower limbs. This bonsai has been allowed to grow two sets of tiny white flowers on the uppermost branches. The tree has been left to grow more or less wild, fleshing out and growing in every direction. Offset from the base of the trunk is a patch of green moss and a small tan rock. The roots of the tree are partially exposed. Etched into the label on the pot are the initials JbFM, and the information that this is a Japanese Privet, answering to Tarquin, while the rock is named Casimir.%r%r[space(5)]A second bonsai can be found perched upon a large, mossy rock resting in a basin of sand. This tiny tree is reminiscent of one painted in a Chinese landscape from the impressionistic Literati period. The rock denotes a mountain and stands almost vertical in its basin while the stubborn tree clings to the rock face with no more than a bit of moss for company. It's set in a crevice and does not obscure the rock's more interesting features. The bonsai's shape is so heavily focused on the trunk that only a minium of foliage is retained to give the impression of a live tree -- excessive foliage would distract from the subtle twists and bends of the tiny spiked trunk. Etched into the label on the pot are the initials JbFM and the information that this is a dwarf Larch that answers to the name &quot;Yue Wan&quot;, which is a Chinese name meaning 'happy and beautiful'.%r
