@@ This creates a hotel clerk vendor. It's fairly simple. The sign should be put in 
@@ another room from the clerk (ie: down a Hallway or whatnot). This is much more complex
@@ than the original version posted to this site, and includes the option for both
@@ 'room' and 'suite' rental. This allows one or two people to have a room. Alternately, 
@@ the suite room can have a different (more upscale) desc. If you implement this code
@@ with an economy system, you can lock activities in a specific area to people only
@@ registered with a room. A sample parent room is included with this code. Lots of nifty 
@@ features with this code, including checks to make sure people have the room for a limited
@@ amount of time, and special door locks.

@Desc here=%r[u(desc[v(descnum)])]%r
&amp;DESC0 here=[space(5)]This room is the heigh of rustic plushness. Mirrors line the entire left wall, reflecting the enormous central bed with slotted skylights above it and a gorgeous stone fireplace opposite it. Long windows cover the back wall and then fan out in a semicircle on the end wall to create a wide alcove for a white marble hot tub on a raised dais. A pair of curving tapestry-upholstered sofas in [u(COLORS)] striped fabric are positioned before the fireplace. On the dais, on either side of the tub, are two more overstuffed chairs upholstered in the same fabric.
&amp;DESC1 here=[space(5)]This room has a definite masculine influence, with the heavy dark green and leather of a gentleman's club, but a few subtle feminine touches save it from austerity. The walls are covered in dark-burgundy and pale-cream striped fabric. A pair of dark green leather couches face a greenish granite fireplace. Two large, comfortable, green-and-burgundy striped wing chairs flank the couch - their sturdy legs resting on a green and cream tufted rug with traces of pink. Heavy mahogany furniture is scattered around. Long windows cover the back wall and then fan out in a semicircle on the end wall to create a wide alcove for a green marble hot tub on a raised dais. Rose brightens the room in the velvet drapes and damask throw-pillows. On the dais, on either side of the tub, are two more overstuffed chairs upholstered in the same striped fabric as the wing chairs.
&amp;DESC2 here=[space(5)]This room is done in what looks like hundreds of shades of blue, ranging from very dark to so light it's nearly white. The walls are papered with varigated striped shades of blue. In the middle of the room is an overwhelming cherrywood four-poster bed draped in an airy cotton of the palest silvery-blue imaginable. Silky-smooth Queen Anne style cherrywood furniture is arranged around, including a pair of couches upholstered in dark blue velvet stretching along the front of the blue-veined stone fireplace. Long windows cover the back wall and then fan out in a semicircle on the end wall to create a wide alcove for a blue marble hot tub on a raised dais. These windows are curtained in a dark blue silk that's almost purple. On the dais, on either side of the tub, are two more overstuffed chairs upholstered in the same velvet fabric as the couches.
&amp;DESC3 here=[space(5)]This is a beautifully bright and cheery room. The floor is light golden oak waxed to a low shine. A pair of soft buff leather couches sit before a glass-topped coffee table which rests on a bright [u(COLORS)] patterned rug. These are arranged in front of a large stone fireplace. Through an arch up one step is the sleep area, dominated by a king-sized waterbed, satin-sheeted and piled high with fluffy pillows. Closets and drawers line the wall opposite the arched opening. Long windows cover the back wall and then fan out in a semicircle on the end wall to create a wide alcove for a deep marble hot tub on a raised dais. These windows are curtained in [u(COLORS)] striped sheers. On the dais, on either side of the tub, are two more overstuffed chairs upholstered in fabric striped with the same colors as the rug and curtains.
