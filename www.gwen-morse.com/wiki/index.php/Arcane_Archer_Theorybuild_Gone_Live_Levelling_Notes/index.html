<p>Since she's going to be doing damage with a bow, I decide to skip low-level light spells and instead take all the crowd control options I can find. Instead of my preferred Nimbus of Light/Searing Light SLA combo, I'll slot Command and Soundburst at low levels.

<p><i>OOPS! Forgot to buy a Tall Quiver from House Deneith before I lost all their favor.</i>
</p><p>1st level: I need to farm her Korthos trapper's set, and 2 pairs of Anger's Step boots. It's a little weird to see Ghee with a rogue icon. She has a Screaming of Bleed Longbow and several stacks of 100 arrows. Memo to self: make a +2 Icy Burst Longbow when the next Risia rolls around, and find a quiver.
</p><p>2nd level: Started on cleric. Equipped my Eternal Wand of Spark of Life (oozes) and my Eternal Wand of Cure Minor Wounds. Why yes, Mr. Mayor, I have indeed rescued your daughter three times. Thank you so much for the two pairs of boots and the Troubleshooter's necklace. I solo all of Korthos on Hard, and repeat two quests for Elite favor and extra reward items.
</p><p><i>After finishing Korthos, I decided to spend my enhancement points. I noticed if I had bothered to put points into Mechanic earlier, I would have been able to take Great Crossbow proficiency at first level. Went back and did the Tavern quest on Elite to nab Oladrin's Great Crossbow. It crits on a 15-20 and will be useful on her third life if I take this build. Put 3 points into Mechanics to help with traps.</i>
</p><p>3rd level: After the Korthos quests and the harbor Solo quests, she hit 3rd level. All crafted trapping gear can now be equipped, her Blur bracers and Phiarlan Mirror Cloak are on, and she's ready for the PUG train around the Harbor. In addition, her icon now defaults to cleric.
</p><p>4th level: She's gimp when partied with others in Elite quests. It takes at least 3-4 hits to kill even the weakest of targets. I don't know if this is an issue with the build, or all archers suck at low levels. She has to pay for her party spot by doing breakables and trapping. In hard quests, solo, I don't feel like it takes a "long" time to get through quests, but it's definitely longer than if she was meleeing and using light SLAs. I pulled all my points out of the Mechanic tree and took Mighty Turning (aka: nuke undead). She's putting points in Radiant servant and the half elf tree (to unlock AA). Someone mentions I can buy a quiver in the Ball and Chain in the Harbor. Bless you random pugger! Arrows are still a PITA to manage, but there's a little less pain.
</p><p><i>On clerics, I usually rush to get the Radiant Burst. She won't be able to get hers until she has 6 cleric levels (at 7th level). After getting Mighty Turning, I dedicated all my AP to the Half-Elf tree as there's nothing that can't wait until later.</i>
</p><p>5th level: I landed a good group doing the circuit of level 3 F2P quests, and then Catacombs. There was another trapper, so all I did was kill (slowly) and throw the occasional cure when someone needed it. I crafted a +4 Wisdom item and my Commands and Sounbursts started to be reliable. I added 10% Ranged Alacrity to her Featherfalling ring. I also turned some Scarlet Scarab powder into a trinket that would give me two extra turns per rest (for undead quests). I filled in my helf tree and started saving the 4 ap I need to unlock AA. For trapping gear, I put on her Goggles of Time-Sensing (+5 Search, +5 Spot, +2 wisdom, Haste 3/rest), and upgraded her crafted swap-in goggles and gloves.
</p><p><i>I'm wondering if I can go from the Troubleshooter's set to Goggles of Time-Sensing to Goggles of Perception to Tharne's Goggles without needing crafted search/spot gear in-between. It would save a lot of crafting essences between all my toons if I only need to craft gloves on trapping lives.</i>
</p><p>6th level: I unlocked AA. Of course, I need more AP to start to buy things in it. I couldn't find any parties doing quests so I decided to solo Catacombs on hard. I snagged an Eternal Wand of Cure Minor wounds. With all my toons, having a second one is useful. After Catacombs people started logging in so I was able to find groups. *BOOM* Command. *BOOM* Soundburst. *BOOM* Mighty Turning. *Whimper* long bow. Now it takes 6-7 shots before I kill something. The gap between the damage she does and the hit point pools of mobs is getting wider. However, her crowd control is very solid and I'm earning my party spot as a flexible support toon.
</p><p>7th level: I rushed to 7th level to get rezz scrolls and the Radiant Burst. After this, I can afford to put points in her AA tree. I also put on her Lesser Boots of Striding and Springing and re-crafted her gear. Ghee happens to have a ML: 7 lootgen ring with Invisibility 3/rest and Devotion +42, so she has a little boots to her positive spellpower. She has enough Mysterious Remnants to buy a +2 Dexterity augment (slotted into boots) and +3 Constitution (saved for her level 8 armor). I'm able to bank 8 by toddling after a pair of chatty zergers who don't mind gimps. I run into a slight hiccup when a bard talks me into trapping Partycrashers. Because Ghee is a trapper, she has no social skills (no Bluff, Diplo, or Intimidate). The bard's player just assumes I have enough skill to max Ghee's diplo, and doesn't bring their bluff item. This means we can't do any optionals. I do pull a sapphire of Heavy Fortification in the final chest, which is a nice find. My trapping is perfect, but the whole quest feels messy. I feel like Ghee is <i>stretched thin</i> in all ways. Not enough skill points, not enough AP, not enough damage, not enough spell slots, needs to boost too many attributes, no fallback UMD, didn't farm enough TR gear on her first life.
</p><p><i>I also discovered I hadn't farmed the Divine set from the Red Fens. This hurts a bit as I really like the consolidation in these two items. I think there's a poisoning set I also want, and I'll want Boots of the Mire for the Waterbreathing.</i>
</p><p><i>Inspiration strikes while writing the level 7 update. I _should_ have taken Artificer Dilettante to start, and then swapped out to Ranger Dilettante when Arcane Archer gets "good". That would have left me free to ignore strength items, conjure ammunition from scrolls (and not worry about buying arrows), do triple damage from the repeater rate, have a dilettante that made use of my archery feats, etc. One Imperfect Siberys Dragonshard and a little plat spent, and Ghee has a new Dilettante feat. I turn her Strength gloves into Wisdom gloves, and craft Charisma into a necklace. I buy 100 Conjure Bolt scrolls, and 100 Elemental Weapon scrolls, steal the Hellfire Crossbow from my level 9 arti, confirm that all scrolls work, and am ready for action.</i>
</p><p>8th and 9th level: Since she doesn't yet have the Goggles of Perception, I put her in the Snakeskin Vest (ML: 8). It gives +10 Spot and +10 Search, as well as the Mobility feat. I get in a good PUG group and blow through quests. Still not killing fast, at least it's not as slowly as earlier. A Soundburst or Command followed by repeater damage allows me to solo hard quests effectively, or be good Crowd Control in a group. I get a few T1 AA enhancements, including acid arrows, but I'll keep my crossbow for now. It may be a glitch, but the acid arrow imbue is applying to her conjured bolts.
</p><p>9th and 10th level: I run with guildies and we hit some nice high XP quests, as well as re-doing Delera's so another member can get their Voice of the Master. One of the party members is happily surprised I can trap on a cleric and I give the 30-second pitch on how I do it. I get an imbue with Force and Ghost Touch. I haven't yet failed a trapping roll, and I don't use skill boosts or Greater Heroism (except briefly when a guildie insist on casting it on me *after* I finish each trap). At 10th level she gets Greater Command and Slay Living. I tend to feel that Slay Living is the first spell on the way to being a full DC caster. I visit my bank and pull out her Mace of Healing (augmented with Impulse 54) and her Dalorent's Seal (augmented with Nullification 54), and I feel like I'm over the worst of the hump.
</p><p><i>Her BAB is now +6, but her Dexterity is too low to qualify for Manyshot. Level 10 is the first time I begin to feel confident I can play this through on a second life. That's okay, learning from my myriad small and large mistakes is part of the process.</i>
</p><p>Second Half 10th Level: I run Sorrowdusk with my husband, on his high-DPS paladin. I handled trapping, light heals, and CC. Archery DPS was weak. I tried using her Silver Longbow with the Morphic and Acid imbues, as well as the repeater with free bonus acid. As my end reward item I grabbed the Bound-To-Account armor I wanted (Oilskin Tunic) and augmented it with her Heavy Fort and Constitution +3 augments from level 7. After Sorrowdusk and one favor cleanup quest, I can finally buy a Tall Thin Quiver from House Denieth. We joined a PUG doing two runs of Tempest Spine, where I snagged a pair of Goggles of Perception and augmented them with Intelligence +3. It's slow to farm remnants for augments, but I'm very grateful the developers added augments to the Mysterious Remnant trader. My husband got his own pair of goggles, as well as a Cloak of Invisibility. Not a bad start on looting for 10th level. I get enough experience for 11th but keep it in the bank. I will sit at 10th until I get all Tempest Spine loot Ghee needs. Before I go to sleep I spend 2 AP for the Metalline imbue.
</p><p><i>I go to sleep and wake up to discover a guildie has lent me an old Required Race: elf/drow/helf +1 Longbow of Paralysing with a Risia Icy Burst on it. To celebrate I return the Hellfire Crossbow to my shared bank (for my arti) and run around the Red Fens wilderness paralysing spawns.</i>
</p><p>11th level: I realize once I wake up that I want to jump to 11th level. Her Torc and her greelsteel accessories are waiting for her! Tempest Spine can take up to 12 and keep Bravery Bonus. Level 11 also means she can start farming the Fens. Her Con-Op hit point belt gives +6 Wisdom but makes her odd, so I borrow 2 AP from the AA tree to grab a point of Wisdom in the Radiant tree. Having a Wisdom item also allows me to move some crafted gear around. I leave Charisma on her neck (a placeholder for the eventual Choker), and Dexterity on her helm, but I increase both to 6. Then, I re-craft her Wisdom gloves into +13 Balance gloves. I switch her from the Greater Stalwart Trinket (bonus HP, Stoneskin proc) to the Greater Cunning Trinket (bonus SP, +1 Enchantment/Necro DCs). I also make a +2 Evocation Focus of Kinetic Lore ring for level 13. Between the extra Wisdom and the +1 to DCs, I'm hoping mobs will save less often against her Greater Command and Slay Living spells.
</p><p>Lingering at 11th level: I take off a few days to run other toons, and then come back to Ghee feeling refreshed. I'm now farming the Red Fens and joining Tempest Spine runs whenever I see them in the LFM panel. I get two Tempest Spine runs the first day back but nothing named drops for Ghee, not even something unwanted I could pass on. Before finding openers for the Fens quests, I run with a PUG as their trapper in level 11 quests on elite (level 13 quests), including a couple of Necro 3 quests and Made to Order. Tomb of the Forbidden is a rough trapping job when I'm trying to switch between turning undead (which I boost with a trinket) and Spot (which I boost with a trinket), and my skills are right on the edge of elite quests. Luckily the group has a bard so Ghee is able to get Greater Heroism and the bard Song of Competence. When the group breaks up I stumble across another group doing the Red Fens chain and get all the quests opened on Elite. I do the whole chain on elite, and I all get of use is the Sacred Band. Then, I farm the quests on casual to get my missing items. It's slow going as I'm only being offered items I want on the 3rd lists, and there's three sets I'm trying to complete. I managed to drag in a friend for the last 3 runs and we each get a wanted item in our mutual 3rd list. Since Ghee now has the Divine Blessing set next life I won't have trinket competition when she's on trapper duty. After farming the three sets, I bank two and put the Divine Blessing set in her pack, then slot an un-upgraded BTA Sora Kell set. Now, as long as she doesn't have to face a lot of undead, she can get the better stat boosts from the Sora Kell set, but still have the cleric set when she 'needs' it. This frees up her craftable necklace to be +6 Dexterity. 
</p><p><i>I'm still struggling with trying to do too much on one character. Turning, Trapping, DC casting in Necromancy and Enchantment without touching the DC casting tree, and archery all put a heavy demand on her gear slots and AP. On paper, they seem to fit together well: charisma can boost both turning and Divine Might. Bow Strength benefits from Divine Might. Trapping requires Dexterity and Wisdom and Intelligence, all stats she needs elsewhere in the build. Without archery, Trapping/DC Casting/Turning all work fine. (I suspect) without Trapping, the Archery build might work better. She would have been in a position to take Manyshot at level 9 if I had given her a starting Dexterity of 15. Still, I'm trying to keep an open mind. She basically crashed hard due to lack of vital gear at 7th level. She's at rough transition point I hit on every trapper cleric life when I'm just waiting for blade barrier, and then the second rogue level. Since her burst is a bit gimpy and I don't feel like her cures are too weak, I trade a Siberys Dragonshard and some plat for a feat swap: Empower Heal gets replaced by Maximize. I level her to 12th level, and get Blade Barrier and Manyshot. I hope the Tempest Spine runs start coming soon.</i>
</p><p>Level 12: Got all her Red Fens gear and took 12. Ghee finally has the much-vaunted Manyshot feat, and Blade Barrier. I snagged another Tempest Spine run. After I reach the first door the party leader pipes up in voice chat and says "Oh, yeah, so this is the part where I admit I don't know this quest." *OUCH*. I'm able to guide to the first couple of locations, then someone else remembers the next few sections, and someone else can guide through the last part. Only item that I pull is a Robe of Potency, which is only useful if Ghee does monk splash or a wiz life. Still, it's not complete trash, and I'll take it and bank it. Once again, someone on the run is surprised a cleric is trapping. The one point I feel the character shines is in Fire and Ice, as I'm sent to kill a Fire Reaver. Ghee's borrowed bow does lots of frost damage, and I'm able to toggle on the cold arrow imbue, so even with a slow rate of fire the Reaver goes down fast.
</p><p><i>I'm getting a sense (although at this point I don't know if it's just wishful thinking) that this theorybuild would be much stronger built on a paladin framework. Ghee will be doing paladin lives, and I'm toying with the idea of a burn-and-turn run to reincarnate to paladin instead of cleric. I'm going to have to resist the temptation, so I can see the build in action now that her TR gear is getting farmed. Manyshot is nice, it lasts longer than I expected it to.</i>
</p><p>More Level 12: Easter Weekend. I get a nice string of Tempest Spine runs, including TWO with guildies. Early in I get the necklace. Now all Ghee needs is the cloak. I found a Youtube video showing how to farm the cloak on a character, I try the run on my level 16 Challenge Monk. It goes smoothly and now I'm debating whether to go back to levelling or stay at 12 a bit longer. Most of the gear on my farming list should be easy to get, except the Gauntlets of Eternity. People do occasionally run Reaver's Fate but it's not a popular raid, and from what I recall the gloves are rather shy about dropping. It may be better to grab 14 (or even 16) and start running Reaver's and Shroud for some wanted raid items. As a plus, I'm getting a better sense of what I want to farm before I reincarnate my acrobat. I really don't have a strong sense of how my theorybuild is performing, I'm resigned to muddling along till Ghee gets another life in it. I run Ghee back to Fred and give him another Siberys Dragonshard + plat to swap back to Ranger Dilettante.
