@dig/teleport Steeple - St. Joseph's Cathedral
@Desc here=[space(5)]The lower section of the steeple of Saint Joseph's. It is dimly lit and slightly musty. Cases of consecrated wine are stacked in one corner, as are boxes of catechumenant baptismal clothes. In another corner is a pile of Christmas decorations. A collection of used catechumenant candles and Ecumenical candles await remelting for use in other consecrated forms in a series of boxes stacked against the west wall. Other boxes line the walls in regimental stacks. Above you are the working of the auto-chimes and bell system. Three stacks of banners and blankets are lined along one side of the trapdoor up. A folding cot with bedding, and a small dresser indicate that this room is occasionally used for more than just storage.%r[space(5)]The steeple is quite large, easily the area of the lower levels of the building as an attic level.
@Succ here=[space(5)]This area is located above the main vaulted ceiling, and the floor is slightly curved (though not drasticaly so) to reflect that.
&amp;JUDGENOTE here=This room has a Faith Rating of: 4. It may be activated by anyone with the Christian-denominational merit True Faith. It does not effect supernatural characters unless there is a Faithful person present. See pgs 23-24 &quot;Hunters Hunted&quot;

Also, few diary-style books in Latin detailing such topics as: Theurgy (vs. Goety), Miracles of Belief (True Faith), Local supernatural creatures discovered and destroyed, Exorcism, the existance of the Sanbenito (followers of the Florentine Heresy), etc. The books have a Study point value of 5, and an Occult Library Value of 1.
@lock here/OCCULT-LIBRARY
&amp;TORTURE here=A few torture devices are packed away in one box. All are portable: a pair of Krantz bands (each to be tightened around a victim's head), three sets of thumbscrews (can double as restraints), a Jaw unit (small vise for the mouth).
@lock here/TORTURE
&amp;HOLY-WATER here=There is a long aluminum locked case which holds about 15 flasks of holy water in easy-open sterling silver flasks. The flasks convert into insta-aspergills when opened. Five of the flasks are full.
@lock here/HOLY-WATER
&amp;HUNTING here=There are also a collection of unusual hunting items. These are all scattered in various locked boxes: a pair of spike-throwers, a pair of double-barrel shotguns with silver-beaded shots, urban combat fatigues to fit three mid to large-sized people, standard camaflague fatigues (as per previous set), a collection of large wooden Crucifix's with the bottoms sharpened to stake-like points, etc. These and the above listed items are the remains of a previous Cenaculum (Society of Leopold).

@dig/teleport Triforium - St. Joseph's Cathedral
&amp;MODE_LOOK_2 here=[space(5)]This is the main part of the Triforium level, a continuous stone balcony which runs along the three sides of the Nave and into the Transepts, before edging into the Chancel's Choir. A row of stained-glass windows, each about twenty feet tall, nestles between the tall marble buttresses and support piers. Glancing down over the four-foot raining, you see the rows of pews fanning out below you. You suddenly realize just how far down eighty feet is.
&amp;MODE_LOOK_1 here=[space(5)]This walkway is the junction between the Triforium balcony and the entrance to the staircase leading down to the main level. Beautiful carved wooden quire stalls line the stone wall extending up about twenty feet - they replace a stained-glass window. The wood is carved into fanciful shapes of suffering figures, saints being martyred in a multitude of ways. These contrast grimly with the overall cheerful ornamentation found in the rest of the building.

&amp;VIEW_SPANISH-CROSS here=%rA heavy Rennaisance cross made of stolen Incan gold sits in a red velvet lined Lexan display case. Almost a pound in weight, the fabulous cross draws the eyes with its heavily carved surface that is only slightly worn away with time and many caressing hands. The very nature of the casting is reminiscent of Old World style. Its glittering surface is augmented by 11 square cut one-quarter carat emeralds that burn blue in their depths. A single square cut one-carat emerald sits at the center of the cross. A tiny card is set alongside the splendid cross in its case, announcing 'Restoration performed by Tawny Alexander'.%r%rOOC note: 'ex here/judgenote_cross-security' for security notes.%r
@Desc here=[space(5)]This is the second level Triforium, a balcony that follows the Roman cross shape of the cathedral. The floor of the balcony is level with the base of twenty-foot tall windows also named the Triforium windows. Reaching sixty feet up from the crown of those are the Clerestory windows, which end at the vault. (In other words: the walls extend up another eighty feet above the floor of the Triforium, with two levels of windows). Several people move along the walkway. Some are craning their heads up to stare at the windows, while others curiously glance around at each other and you. Looking over the four-foot tall stone balustrade railing guarding the edge of the walkway, you can make out the main cathedral floor down about eighty feet below.

@dig/teleport St. Joseph's Cathedral
@Desc here=%r[space(5)]This is St. Joseph's cathedral, dedicated to Saint Joseph, foster father of Jesus and husband of Mary. Huge wooden doors lead out to the street, flanked by quality reproductions of classical DaVinci angels clasping golden bowls of holy water. A red carpet is rolled out starting at the entrance doorway and leading straight down the main aisleway of the cathedral to the base of the elevated altar. The cathedral is a gothic roman cross shape, with a point-arched vault ceiling over bay walls. Tall and impossibly-slender column piers provide support for the ceiling and a balcony running along the second level as well as outline the magnificent stained glass windows that form the walls. The bottom level of windows is eighty feet tall, and called the Arcade. The middle level of windows is twenty feet tall and is called the Triforium, as is the balcony that runs along it around the whole interior of the building. The upper level of windows is called the Clerestory, and at sixty feet tall, they just meet the lower edge of the vault above.%r[space(5)]Pews fan out the length and breadth of the area, dotted with parishoners praying intently. People trickle in and out of side chapels along the Arcade, and occasionally you hear foosteps echo from above. There seems to be a good amount of visitors here, no matter what the time of day.

&amp;MODE_LOOK_1 here=[space(5)]This is the Nave. Seemingly endless rows of pews take up most of the space. Looking up, you see the overwhelming splendour of the vault. Trim, white stone arches called &quot;ribs&quot; criss-cross each bay, and the wide triangular spaces between are filled with smooth grey concrete. The connection of the piers, buttresses, and ribs gives the illusory appearance of downward-curving birds wings along the length of the vault. You might want to check out the stained glass 'windows' visible in the Nave.
&amp;MODE_LOOK_2 here=[space(5)]This is the Crossing, so named because you must walk through here to cross to any other part of the Cathedral, and it forms the center of the Roman Cross shape of the building. There are no windows or walls in the Crossing (it represents the 'air' space in the center of the two tower Transepts and the Chancel and Nave), only the vault high above. This is the most intricate area of the vault in the whole cathedral, both because the pattern of the ribbing changes from a simple criss-cross to the cross being surounded by extra arches turning it into a four-pointed star, and because the concrete has been carved with eye-pleasing triangular maze patterns. Straight above you on the exterior of the vault is the cathedral spire, which houses the auto-chimes.
&amp;MODE_LOOK_3 here=[space(5)]Here in the Chancel, you can look at the altar platform or turn back and look down length of the cathedral towards the main entrance. Looking down the sweeping length of the building, it looks unreal: it is too tall, too slender, too graceful and fragile to stand up. It seems to have no walls, nothing to hold up the stone vault but a row of willowy piers reaching eloquently upward as they outline tremendous glass windows. The piers continue to form the ribs meeting at the crown of the vault, curving and supporting like the overarching branches of a stand of hardwood trees. Light from outside shines through the colored glass in the windows, making it glow, the effect almost magical. The Chancel is divided into two parts. Near the Crossing is the quire, with carved hardwood stalls for the Benedictine sisters of the abbey to rest during services. Beyond the quire is the high Altar area.
&amp;MODE_LOOK_4 here=[space(5)]You are in the North Transept tower. About thirty square feet in size, it extends up the full height of the rest of the Cathedral. There is a side altar dedicated to Mary, the Holy Mother. A collection of icon statuettes depict Mary in her traditional blue and white robes, a smiling woman surrounded by a heavenly host of winged angels. A fan-shaped shelf with votive candles spreads out at her feet. Several candles are lit, their flames flickering slightly as if defying some ill wind.
&amp;MODE_LOOK_5 here=[space(5)]You are in the South Transept tower. About thirty square feet in size, it extends up the full height of the rest of the Cathedral. There is a side altar dedicated to Saint Joseph, the foster father of Jesus and the husband of Mary. An icon statuette of Saint Joseph depicts him in his traditional brown robes, holding a plank of wood and an axe. The peacefully sublime expression on his face is often particularly relaxing to people who notice it. A fan-shaped shelf with votive candles spreads out at his feet. Several candles are lit, their flames flickering defiantly in a slight breeze.
&amp;MODE_LOOK_6 here=[space(5)]You are seated in Pew 1. The solid wooden length of the pew extends past where you're sitting, polished smooth by both the original builder and countless faithful who have rested here before you. The back of the pew in front of yours has missals and songbooks arranged neatly in a latticed rack. A padded kneeler can be lowered to provide minimal relief from the cold marble floors.
&amp;MODE_LOOK_7 here=[space(5)]You are seated in Pew 2. The solid wooden length of the pew extends past where you're sitting, polished smooth by both the original builder and countless faithful who have rested here before you. The back of the pew in front of yours has missals and songbooks arranged neatly in a latticed rack. A padded kneeler can be lowered to provide minimal relief from the cold marble floors.
&amp;MODE_LOOK_8 here=[space(5)]The elevated Altar area is dominated by the altar itself, a large slab apparently solid stone covered with a white linen cloth embroidered with gold and silver cross images. Behind the altar is the highly ornamented tabernacle, curtained with more decorated fabric. There are lit candles in heavy polished candlesticks on either side of the tabernacle enclosure. Eighty feet above curves a pointed arch, the point of which supports the base of the tall hardwood cross, with a carved-ivory corpus in larger-than-life detail. The crucifix arch arcs OVER the altar area, so that it rests seemingly in midair, rather than on the wall. Seasonal colored cloth hangings with simple pictoral images and text messages flutter below either side of the base of the cross. To each side of the altar is a wooden pulpit with a microphone neatly wired in place. Each one supports a different closed book.

A reconstruction of the famous 'Tapestry of Creation', each 'petal' in the rose shape was based on a seperate panel from the tapestry. In the roundel center, God the Creator - depicted as a solemn young man with a wise expression - raises His hand to bless the beginning of Creation. Radiating from Him are the six days of creation, long slivers of brilliant color depicting the stages from the separation of the firmament, to the making of Eve.

&amp;VIEW_CRUCIFIX here=%rEighty feet above the floor of the Chancel spans a wide arch, the point of which supports the base of the tall hardwood cross with a carved-ivory corpus in larger-than-life detail. The arch arcs OVER the altar area, so that the crucifix floats seemingly in midair, rather than on the wall. Christ rests wearily against the heavy wooden cross, His pale limbs barely draped with a bit of rag carved into soft folds. His palms and overlapped feet are pierced with dark nails (which appear to be faintly stained red, but that could be a trick of the light). Scrolled above His thorn-crowned head are the letters &quot;INRI&quot;. His face has a decidedly Semetic cast to it, and the ivory has yellowed with age, a fair indication that the corpus was carved many centuries ago. Seasonal colored cloth hangings with simple pictoral images and text messages flutter below either side of the base of the cross.%r
&amp;VIEW_CANDELABRUMS here=%rTwelve standing candelabrums made of bronze and tipped with silver are set into specially designed niches along the length of the building. All these 8 foot candelabrums were obviously gifts to the Church from a noble in the distant past, and preserved till they were placed in this cathedral. Each bears a distinctive coat of arms that is worked several times into the base plates. Ten of these massive pieces can hold up to 12 candles each on their tiered outspread arms. Two larger than the rest can hold up to 18 candles in such a way to maximize the spread of their light to the surrounding altar area where they have been placed. Each has a fine etching of fleur-de-lis into the silver that surrounds the base cuff and the arms of the candle-holders. A slight crimping in a few portions of the fleur-de-lis patterns and coats-of-arms are the only indication that these have been restored from some previously unseemly state.%rRestoration, courtesy Tawny Alexander%r
&amp;VIEW_BAPTISMAL-FONT here=%rLooking through the grilled gate locking the baptismal chapel you see a large copper bowl resting comfortably on its base of clawed feet. This was used by priests to baptize people on the battlefield before combat during the Dark Ages. A man could immerse himself to the waist when standing in it while it was filled. Now it has the more peaceful obligation of being used in modern infant and adult baptisms. Almost worn away is a faint, half-discernable pattern of diamonds that are etched into its outer surface. One foot has been replaced with a newer and harder copper that practically matches the color of the older copper. Portions of its curving lip are penny bright with replacement material while other portions are darker but still brightly-polished copper from many centuries ago.%rRestoration, courtesy Tawny Alexander%r

@Desc here=[space(5)]Cold. Austere. These are the first two impressions you get of the convent entryway, warmed only when you take in the beauty of the architecture. The tall marble walls repeat the style of the cathedral - buttressed piers framing breathtaking stained glass windows. Hallways lead off to the various offices, dormitories, work areas, and the Chapter Hall. There is a fine mosaic floor you can appreciate more fully with +view. A thick wooden door with a heavy lock leads further into the complex. This building houses a completely self-contained community of religious.
@Succ here=[space(5)] A pair of Sisters and a younger Novice are always 'posted' on-duty, to take messages, and deal with visitors. Men are NOT allowed in the building, and WILL be 'escorted' out.

No holes larger than a human head may be poked in them). They are 10' above the ground, and extend 5' up to the ceiling. All rooms are stone (or, more properly, concrete faced with stone - there are no 'vents'/'ducts'/'shafts' in the walls). There are old-style heavy wooden doors doors in and out. Wiring and heating systems are hidden under metal protectors along the seams of the rooms. Solar power backs up the main electrical and water heating systems with panels situated along the roof.

&amp;VIEW_EXTRA-ROOMS here=%rHallways lead off to the many rooms in this abbey complex. A 'wooden door' near the entryway catches your attention, as well as the Sisters sitting watching the entrance with alert patience. Several rooms can be accessed as necessary by RP in the main Cloisters area: the common Dormitory, the abbey chapel, the refrectory, the chapter hall, the work area, the scriptorium and library, the guest rooms (female only), storage and security rooms, etc.
&amp;VIEW_RANKS here=%rPostulancy: the lowest rank. A postulant joins the religious 'community', and has a small ceremony where they ask to be taught the rule of the convent and be shown the religious way of life. They are required to wear a specific 'uniform', are bound by simple vows, and must meet all the entry requirements. IC postulancy is one IC year (minimum). A postulant has no change to her name. All PC's who retroactivly join must go through the postulancy, new characters may start as novices or professed sisters. She may ask to be released at any time, though, returning will of course be difficult.%r%rNovitiate: the middle rank. A postulant may present herself to the community after one year, and ask to start her novitiate. The community will vote, and if she's found acceptable, she will be allowed to join as a Novice. At this point, she has a more elaborate ceremony, changes her 'uniform' slightly, is allowed to wear the Benedictine crest, and is bound by more specific vows. The vows are traditionally taken for one or three years at a time. A novice may not progress to professed sister until she is at least 25 years old. She may ask to be released at any time - special dispensation is required unless is it occurs at the time she would normally reknew her vows.%r%rProfessed Sisters: a traditional 'nun'. She is bound by solemn, perpetual (lifetime) vows, and may only be released with special dispensation. She may either dress in a full habit, or a modified version of the novice and postulants uniforms. Professed Sisters may perform certain ceremonies excluded from the other two groups (Liturgy of the Hours, etc), may offer the sacrament of Baptism, and may perform some parts of the mass (excluding blessing the Eucharist).%r%rThere are two levels of professed sisters: Choir nuns are an 'elevated' form of religious (above standard professed sister). There is no real IC difference in 'rank' between the two groups, choir nuns are simply better educated, and are the group the abbess and other teachers or leaders are chosen from. A choir nun is expexpected to start with (or buy during training) the following stats: Lingustics: Latin, Leadership or Etiquette 1, Expression or Public-speaking 1, Music 2, Singing 2, Theology 3 OR Theology 2 + a 3 in one of the following groups: Medicine, Instruction, Psychology, Diplomacy, Law, Artistry, Crafts.
&amp;VIEW_DRESS-CODE here=%rThe dress code for postulants is: calf-length grey skirt, any solid color blouse or shirt with a loose grey vest. The shoes must be black, polished, and 'sensible' or 'comfortable' looking. A white veil with a white band covers the hair, but leaves the face bare.%r%rThe dress code for novice sisters is: an ankle-length grey skirt, white long-sleeved blouse/shirt, and a loose grey vest. The shoes must be black, polished, and 'sensible' or 'comfortable' looking. A white veil with a white band covers the hair, but leaves the face bare. They may wear a pin or embroidered vest patch with the Benedictine crest on it.%r%rThe dress code for professed sisters is: same as a novice, or may be modified by replacing the skirt with trousers.

&amp;VIEW_MOSAIC here=%rTiny tiles have been arranged into a large, simple, but visually striking mosaic on the floor of this entryway. The white background is overlaid with a black cross; the pointed equilateral arms seperate the sheild-shaped mosaic into four quarters with bold, script-styled letters in each section. Facing in from the doorway, the top left holds a 'c', the top right a 's', the bottom left a 'p', and the bottom right a 'b'. This is the simple crest of the supporters of the Rule of Saint Benedict. Bold red tiles outline the stark black-and-white pattern.%r

They watch the door and entryway area at all times. Presume an alertness pool of 6 for the two Sisters and 5 for the Novice. Finally, there are between 3 and 5 other Sisters and visitors moving throughout the entryway area, as well as between 10 and 40 nuns throughout the building at any particular time.

@dig/teleport Rectory
@Desc here=[space(5)]This is the waiting area for the Cathedral offices. The walls are oak-panelled, and are decorated with various religious paintings. In the middle of the wall opposite the offices is an alcove with a statue of St. Joseph in it. Comfortable couches are on either side of the alcove. Besides the door leading out, and the doors to the offices, there is a hallway leading up to stairs which go to the second floor, where living quarters are found. The floor here is typical institutional flat carpet, but many green plants are scattered about the room to lend it a feeling of life. Several pictures are arranged along the walls - representations of bible scenes, and a portrait of the present pontiff - his Holiness, Pope John Paul the Second.

OOC: Check the +views for important information.
@dig/teleport Cathedral Courtyard
@Desc here=%tYou are in the Courtyard between the Cathedral and the support buildings. This is a surprisingly large place considering its location in a busy metropolitan area - a rather unsubtle reminder of the power of the Roman Catholic Church. The main courtyard is a brick square flanking each of the support buildings, with a fountain in the center. The forest and herb gardens are to the west.

&amp;MODE_COMMANDS_3 here=in the birch Forest
&amp;MODE_LOOK_1 here=%tCarved from a rather chalky shade of grey granite is fountain capped by a pair of statues representing what appears to be Jesus with Mary Magdalene. Kneeling at the feet of the rather weary-looking Christ is a young woman, her long hair uncovered, with a pitcher that endlessly pours water just past Christ's feet. You could probably 'drink' some water if you wanted to. Smoothed granite chunks have been have been stacked and cemented together to represent rocky shores around the fountain pool. The water looks cool and very clear. The scene acts as a daily reminder that it is not always the most socially acceptable people who have the strongest and deepest faith.
&amp;MODE_LOOK_2 here=%tThis garden is a traditional English knot garden with symmetrical planting beds and graveled paths. It is shaped like a wagon wheel with a sundial at the center, low growing herbs as the spokes, and four beds between the spokes which have a small tree centered in each; a bay tree, a dwarf cinnamon, a dwarf nutmeg, and a tree rose. Shrub and hedge-like herbs surround the trees. The seasonal herbs are used to help flavor the foods served in the shelter and orphanage.
&amp;MODE_LOOK_3 here=%tThe &quot;forest&quot; (if you can really call it that) is a small selection of varities of birch trees, from Silver to Paper-Bark, that were lovingly protected during the initial construction of the Cathedral. Paths wander amidst the trees, covered with old fallen leaves that soften the ground. Large green leaves deck the birch trees, shivering with every movement of the air. A few bright flowers--wood violets and foxglove--peek out from behind greenery. Star jasmine climbs the trunks of a few trees sending out a rich fragrance. The daytime sun shines through moving leaves, casting dappled shade; at night the moon and stars silver the trees-tops with bright light, while the bases remain dark pools of shadow. Sword ferns spread between the trunks of the trees. Pendulous blossoms of purple, magenta, and white dangle from the fuchsias nestled in the ferny undergrowth. Scattered throughtout the forest are a few benches of chalky-looking grey granite.

&amp;JUDGENOTE-SANCTUARY here=People who have been offered sanctuary by a PC religious will not be removed from the grounds unless the commit an act of such heinious sacriliage that risking their life is worth removing them from the grounds. Note: 'acting up' is not heinious. Two examples of extreme behavior would be: urinating on a sacred/revered item or spraypainting profanities within the cathedral complex. In NO CASE will they be removed from the grounds without getting in IC contact with the religious who invited them here in the first place. If the behavior is extreme enough, an offending character can be 'paused' until all parties involved are online to deal with it. While on the grounds, they will be 'protected' by a small group (2-4) of religious at all times. These watchers will NOT interfere with their privacy, simply be there to make sure no one gets in to attack them. Treat as normal mortal bystanders as far as stats, with a high Mental grouping. (High Per/Wits). Sanctuary recipients leave the grounds at their own risk.

But, they must respect that this is a religious community and so keep personal beliefs or worship as private as possible. They will not be expected or required to participate in any ceremonies within the complex itself.%r%rSanctuary recipients are presumed to be the responsibility of the PC religious who invited them.%r%rHave staff ex '#6981/judgenote-sanctuary' for more.%r
