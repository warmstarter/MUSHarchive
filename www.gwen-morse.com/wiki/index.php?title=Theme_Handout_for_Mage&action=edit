All terms, concepts, and systems within this handout are copyrighted and trademarked by White Wolf game systems. Any changes or differences from the stated rules as included in Mage: The Ascension are most likely purposeful and meant to fit within my personal vision of the world system.

This document presumes you've never played White Wolf's Mage World of Darkness game. If you have, it will act as a reference and reminder.

=== Concepts of the Game ===

Modern Mages: Mages are enlightened beings, mortal humans who have gained mastery over manipulating reality itself. Mages are the only beings who actually shape reality. All others may have access to unusual or even incredible-seeming powers. However, they fit within consensual reality in some way or another. Only Mages have 'Awakened' past reality's limitations - the Magick they practice manipulates reality as they choose. Only Mages pay the price for this power with 'Paradox' backlashes, injuries, and spirit-attacks if they stretch Reality too far, too fast. Awakening is universal - all ages, genders, racial types, cultures, and orientations have produced Awakened Mages. Each Mage is a product of his or her environment, culture, and upbringing. Each Mage has the option of joining any number of factions. And, each Mage has a different view on Magick and how and why it works - known as their 'Paradigm'. What faction (and sub-group within the factions) they choose, what culture they are raised in, and what Paradigm flavors their magic affects how a Mage will move through life.

Avatar: An Avatar is the shard of the divine within each Mage, their soul and the source of their power. They become Mages the moment their 'sleeping' Avatar 'awakens'. An Avatar is represented in many ways, both statistical and role-oriented. The Avatar represents how well a Mage interacts with Quintessence, influences status in Mage society (strong Avatars are more respected), and acts as an actual alter-ego personality that interacts with a Mage, teaching Magickal lessons in a variety of ways. Avatars are usually very symbolic to a Mage based on their upbringing and style of magic: a Christian Mage might converse with a stern angel where a computer programmer might receive odd email messages from an untraceable source. While an Avatar is connected to a Mage, they can be thought of as a separate entity. Avatars are immortal, and cycle through the world in multiple reincarnations. The Mage is just a bag of flesh and will that the Avatar is linked to this time around.

Awakening: Just what is Awakening? It's best described as the moment when a human really and truly *understands* that reality is flexible and can be manipulated at will. At that point, they become a Mage. This is more than just being told 'Hey...reality is flexible' and saying 'Okay, I believe it'. The mental processes involved are so deep and complex that only a tiny fraction of the world's population ever achieve it. A Mage will usually Awaken after years of careful preparation and training (there are groups dedicated to finding potential candidates and preparing them). Occasionally, a Mage will spontaneously self-Awaken - without any real explanation of things, they will comprehend reality on their own. Throughout history, Mages who Awakened without instruction were very rare. In recent times, this has become much more common. Some point to this as being an apocalyptic sign. Others have better things to do than worry about the 'why' of it, and just try to deal with the results. The kinder ones offer to train the lone Mages. Others resort to kidnapping, brainwashing, and torture to convert them.

Reality: Reality is 'fluid' within the World of Darkness, and can be affected by someone with a strong enough will. However, Reality is not a gaseous cloud that can be twisted, convoluted, and inverted at whim. This means that while there is flexibility, there are limitations to Magickal use. The Earth, itself, has a certain standard level of reality...it's own 'Paradigm'. This governs the basics - air is breathable, water is wet, and mathematics allows you to add numbers together and guarantee their results. Different countries also have their own Paradigms. The population of Turkey, with its several thousand years of wars and Middle Eastern culture, has different legends, beliefs, and expectations than the population of the United States. A Djinni or Roc appearing in Turkey would be more 'acceptable' to the local Paradigm than an appearance on Wall Street in the U.S. However, a UFO appearing in American would stretch reality less than in Istanbul. Also, within each country, there are also regional Paradigms. Within the U.S. an 'Elvis sighting' would be expected around Graceland or in Las Vegas, but, the locals in Nebraska might raise a few eyebrows. Certain individuals may also have Paradigms attached to the work they do in public. Stage magicians, faith healers, shamans, and occultists/mediums who happen to use True Magick all can accomplish more in front of a group of (semi-)believers than a person acting like a Dark Ages wizard in the middle of Wall Street morning crowds. That same 'wizard' could act much more easily at a renaissance faire or fantasy event.

Paradigms: As discussed above, Paradigm is a flexible concept referring to both a personal belief system of how reality functions, as held by an individual Mage, as well as the blueprint of reality in a particular location (street, community, city, state, country, continent, or just Earth itself). A Mage's personal Paradigm is a reflection of how they will perform True Magick (what sort of effects they will produce with what sort of rituals). A location's Paradigm is a reflection of how local Reality has been shaped and the level of flexibility of different types of Magickal effects.

The Ascension War: As mentioned above, there are differing factions. These factions battle amongst each other for the right to 'control' reality. Because reality is fluid in the World of Darkness, it is possible through clever manipulations to actually change the way humanity as a whole perceives what is and isn't 'realistic'. There was a time when much of the 'science' we take for granted was NOT the reality mortals knew. The Mythic Age (the medieval period), was a time when Vampires stalked the nights without fear or secrecy, when Wizard-Mages ruled from ivory towers and the Saints walked among men working their miracles. Werewolves ran free in the Black Forest and other shape-shifters could be found in every wild place along with fairies of all temperaments and sizes. Dragons, unicorns, love-potions and flying carpets, were all accepted as part of reality by the population. The Mages and other supernatural creatures grew too cruel, too controlling, too dangerous to common mortals. Pocket groups of Mages sprang up, branding reality with their own special stamp. They were the champions of the Unawakened mass of humanity that dominated the planet. The Science they began to discover and weave into reality was embraced by the mortal world. Machines were created, information was disseminated, technology became a word the common man accepted. The 'Technocracy' was born of the Mages who favored the new Magick of Science over the old traditional ways. Those who kept to the old ways became known as the 'Traditions'. The Technocracy went too far in liberating the common man, however, laboring to sanitize and conform reality and humanity to one universal collection of rules that would eliminate creative free thought and individuality (a 'Big Brother' effect). The Traditions, having learned (somewhat) from their mistakes during the Mythic Age, struck back against the technocratic advances, and continue to do so to this day. While they nearly lost the battle before they'd begun, modern trends are shifting to give the Traditions some hope. This was the beginning of the 'Ascension War': a conflict over which flavor of reality would dominate, traditional Magick or science. Some also battle for the additional benefit of claiming control over which flavor of reality would unlock the potential within all non-magical mortals (known as 'Sleepers') and mass-Awaken the whole planet in a single, apocalyptic wave called 'Ascension'. Whether this Ascension will ever actually occur is something for the oldest and wisest of Mages to debate. The Traditions fight for the right to continue doing Magick the way they choose to. The Technocracy fights for the right to eliminate Traditional Magick in the name of Science.

The World of Darkness: The world of darkness is much like the world we live in. However, life is grimmer and more menial. The rich are richer and the middle class are barely a step above the poor. Buildings are tall, more often built of stone, with gargoyles and stained-glass ornamentation. Street gangs run wild, blood flows in alleys and nightclubs, and the music is harsh, discordant, and singularly depressing. A grim miasma of grayness hangs over everything, giving the people, clothing, buildings, and natural areas an otherworldly air. It combines the shadow-cloaked mysteries of a gothic novel with the blood and leather of street-gangs. While only a select few of the mortal population knows that fairies, werewolves, Mages, ghosts, and vampires are more than just legends, the shadow-forces of these groups still affect the common people and influence their misery. All this despair and violence seems to be building up to something - the final battle of the Ascension War may just determine whether the World of Darkness transcends or self-destructs.

Other Mages: Other groups who practice non-Technological Magick but are not recognized as Council members exist and are known as 'Crafts' - a name the Council of Traditions give them, not one they use amongst themselves. More 'proper' or 'appropriate' terms exist, but, most Tradition Mages don't bother to learn them, not knowing any Craft members to discuss the topic with. The Crafts are organized, structured, and share common cultural influences. Some Crafts at least rumored to exist are the Sisters of Hippolyta (modern-day Amazons), Jewish Kabbalists, and the well-known Hollow Ones (discussed later). Outside even the provinces of the Crafts are 'Orphan' Mages. They represent self-Awakened Mages who have had no opportunity to be trained within a Tradition or Craft, or simply have no interest in the structured groups. As such, they have the most difficult path in learning Magick, but have some of the greatest triumphs. Since they've learned no rules, they can sometimes accomplish things Traditional Mages would never consider. Other groups are whispered about, the evil 'Nephandi' who have sold their souls to demons in exchange for great Magickal powers, and 'Marauders' who are crazy-Mages who warp reality around them to fit within their personal dementia. However, both these kinds of Mages appear rarely, if at all, to the rest of mortal and Mage society. The Technocracy is the greatest overall threat to a Traditional Mage.

Mortals: Most mortals are completely oblivious to the supernatural world around them. While they may be intrigued by the occult, they no more believe in it than they believe in Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny. However, some have been touched by the supernatural in one way or another - a family member Awakened as a Mage, a spouse discovering they are kin to werewolves, a lover slain by a vampire's feeding-frenzy, a child haunted by the wraith of a dead parent, a lonely teen enchanted by fairies. Those who know about the supernatural world (even just one part of it) are referred to as being 'Aware'. Those who act out against it in anger or with other destructive impulses are called 'Hunters'. It is rumored that some mortals have extraordinary abilities above those of the common herd, but, nothing is known about them if they do. Most Mages conjecture that those claims are traces of True Magick being exposed to the public. Mages often refer to mortals as 'Sleepers' - a direct opposition to a Mage's 'Awakened' status.

Quintessence and Tass: This is the raw fuel of Magick, as well as the base building material of the entire universe (similar to 'Mana' in other magic-based gaming systems). Quintessence makes up the world, the plants, the animals, people, everything. 'Nodes' are locations on the Earth where Quintessence forms pools or wells of power that may be tapped. They, incidentally, tend to be places of spiritual or mystical power of some sort - very beautiful and scenic locations, sites of great battles or traumas, churches or graveyards, occult shops, etc. Quintessence is *not* needed to create Magickal effects, but it does ease the process. Very rarely, Quintessence materializes in solid form. This varies by the site of the Node and the person finding it. This frozen Quintessence is commonly referred to as 'Tass'. It can be carried from place to place, traded among Mages like currency, and used at any time to fuel Magickal effects. Tass will appear in many forms, from magic mushrooms, to pretty stones, to a protein powder or bit of hardware.

Paradox: All Mages, Tradition, Technocrat, or Other, dread the experience of Paradox descending on them. Mages manipulate reality, pressing against the collective unconscious of mortal minds and other forces they can never completely understand. The use of obvious Magick can create an anomaly within reality, like a balloon that has been blown up too much that pops, or a rubberband stretched too far that breaks. When reality has been strained in this way, Paradox descends as a way to set things back 'right'. The agents of this 'backlash' are known as Paradox Spirits. They can cause physical damage to the Mage, weird occurrences around the Mage, or sometimes attack or even carry the Mage off to another dimensional 'Realm'. The more often a Mage is obvious in flashing around their powers, the more likely it is that Paradox will destroy them at one point or another. In mechanics terms, Paradox is a controlling force to prevent Mages from simply doing too much, too fast.

Vulgar vs. Coincidental Magick: As mentioned above, Paradox is more likely to descend on Mages who are more obvious in their Magick use. An occasion when Magick use is dangerous to the Mage and those around them is referred to as 'Vulgar' Magick. It's vulgar, because it's offensive to reality (though it still has the chance to overcome it). Vulgar Magick is anything that does not fit within the cultural and geographical Paradigm of the area (of course that definition is highly fluid itself, depending on the location). 'Coincidental' Magick is anything that can be rationalized away by the cultural and geographical Paradigm of the area. Vulgar Magick is more difficult to perform while there are un-Awakened (mortal) witnesses present, but, it is *still* considered Vulgar even if no one but the Mage sees it. The local 'area' reality has already been set, even if no one is there to maintain it. Creative Mages who are masters of Coincidental Magick tend to have a significantly longer linesman than their more flashy counterparts. Both Traditional and Technocratic Mages use Vulgar and Coincidental Magick. However, those with a properly-developed sense of self-preservation only use Vulgar Magick in an extreme or emergency situation.

Examples of situations with 'vulgar' and 'coincidental' effects

Situation 1: Mage wants to destroy enemy with fire Vulgar: Shoots 'fireball' from fingertips Coincidental: Gas main blows up under the victim.

Situation 2: Mage wants to heal a cracked bone. Vulgar: Places hands over break and bone audibly 'knits' back into place, bruises fade, etc. Coincidental: &lt;heals internal damage> "Oh, look it's just a sprain..."

Situation 3: Mage needs cash. Vulgar: Conjures a suitcase of money out of 'thin air' Coincidental: Controls random factors of lottery tickets to win a Scratch-off jackpot.

Why Use Vulgar Magick?: When your back is against the wall, and you have nothing to lose anyway, Vulgar Magick can be particularly effective. When you're out-maneuvered and overpowered by the opposition, and there's no time to plan out a coincidental effect, Vulgar is the way to go. It's more difficult, but not impossible. Another reason is to increase the force or intensity of an effect: you don't just want to patch up a hurt group member, you want her restored to perfect health or, you don't just want the enemy slowed down, you want him smeared one micron thick across the concrete. Additionally, some effects can only be accomplished with Vulgar Magick - causing or healing 'Aggravated' damage can only be accomplished with Vulgar effects. Finally, in a truly do-or-die situation, some Mages are willing to risk failing and causing Paradox backlashes...because backlashes have been known to affect the opposition as well, and they hope that succeed or fail, at least they'll get rid of the 'bad guys' too.

=== The Technocracy ===

These are the Mages who started as humanity's saviors but changed to take the roles of the oppressors. They believe there is no 'Magick' or 'Ascension' or even 'God'. There is only the structured, perfect order to be brought about by the gifts of 'Science'. The Technocratic faction is formed of several groups. They consider Traditional Magick users 'Reality Deviants' who must be eliminated any way possible - assimilation or death being their main choices. This is referred to as the 'Pogrom' by the Technocracy. They are not options for player characters, the information here is what you're presumed to have learned in the course of your training.

* Iteration X: Iteration X is responsible for melding man with machine. They exploit advances in mechanical and cybernetic technology to make an 'improved' human. They believe the path to global Ascension will be paved by merging biological intelligence with artificial intelligence. They are amongst the most 'humane' of the technocracy - providing handicapped people with advances to make their lives as good as, or even better than, 'healthy' humans. But, they are also the most emotionless, enforcing the Pogrom with Terminator-like 'Hit Marks'.

* New World Order: Nicknamed 'Big Brother' by the rest of the Technocracy. They're the most active among the Technocracy. They collect information in all its forms - mostly through the use of surveillance devices. They don't manufacture the devices, they leave that up to Iteration X. However, they're the most effective at using them. They have a sub-group known as 'Men in Black'. These dark-suited men were designed to be mistaken for Federal Agents who accomplish an astounding range of distressingly coincidental effects.

* Progenitors: Similar to Iteration X, but, with a different emphasis. They also seek to improve humanity, but, through genetic engineering rather than cybernetic grafts. They use accelerated cloning methods to forward their Darwinist beliefs. They're advanced enough that you don't know if your work buddy really *IS* your buddy, or a clever copy.

* The Syndicate: The money-makers and politicians of the Technocracy. They provide the funds for the other groups projects, incidentally acting as the final ruling authority with the power of the purse-strings. They control politics through cartels, blackmail, and street gangs. And they control financial situations by influencing popular culture: fashion, advertising, art, mainstream literature and entertainment.

* Void Engineers: This is the most adventurous and freethinking of the Technocracy. They're dedicated to exploring the 'unknown' frontiers. Space, deep undersea missions, even the spirit realms. They were responsible for the moon landing (much to the disgust of the other technocrats) and seek to push humanity into the solar system and beyond.

=== The Traditions ===

The Traditions are a loose collection of nine groups who all have a very different view of Magick and how it 'works'. Their main reason for unity is protection from the Technocracy, Nephandi, and Marauders. As such, there is a great deal of infighting, bickering, squabbling, and confrontation between the groups. The Traditions are united within the 'Council of Traditions', which has nine 'seats', each represented by a different sphere of Magick. Also note that while some of the names are gender based (like the Akashic Brotherhood) none of the Traditions discriminate based on gender. Those who can work True Magick are too rare to let petty concerns over gender or even race interfere. Many Crafts do have gender or ethnic restrictions, however, only one Craft is open to starting characters. Two former Technocracy groups 'defected' to the Tradition council (mentioned below). Not understood by the more conservative Technocrats, their frustration with Technocracy pressures resulted in them breaking their ties. Needless to say, they are neither completely trusted by the other Traditions, nor willingly given up by the remaining Technocracy (which chooses death over re-assimilation for those lost from their organization).

* Akashic Brotherhood: Most Mages tread the path of Ascension. Akashic Brothers flow along the path. They believe in perfecting the self in Mind and Body by mastering the way called 'Do' (pronounced: Dough), a blend of martial arts and meditation. Do acts as both a focus for their Magick and the guiding force in their lives. While most brothers (or sisters) are Asian, Westerners can be accepted into their ranks. Their dominant sphere of Magick is Mind.

* Celestial Chorus: The Chorus sees Magick within a religious framework. 'The One', the Chorus name for the universal godhead, may be worshiped within any temple, mosque, or church, so long as it is recognized. Chorus Mages are concerned with the well-being of humanity more than any other group. They are the Good Samaritans who provide light in the overwhelming gloom of the World of Darkness. Because of strong religious beliefs, particularly by the dominant Christian and Catholic sects, they mistrust and are mistrusted by other Tradition members who don't conform to their beliefs. Their dominant sphere of Magick is Prime. [Note: Prime as a sphere is *usually* most effective when combined with other spheres. As such, a Celestial Chorus Mage would most likely study several other spheres.]

* Cult of Ecstasy: Mages who have taken the art of losing oneself in physical pleasures to a path of Ascension. They are known to focus their Magick with vices of all sorts - drugs, sex, drinking, food, gambling, etc. They were the force behind the Bacchus cults of Greece and the Summer of Love during the 60's. They walk the fine line between the loss of control their vices bring, and the discipline required to control their Magick and not let addiction overwhelm them. Their dominant sphere is Time.

* Dreamspeakers: Mages who are the tattered remains of the prehistoric and aboriginal traditions. With the aid of drums, feathers, crystals, and chants, these shaman-Mages walk the Dreamlands and communicate with spirits and the dead. Their members are made up of the 'native' peoples of Australia, North and South America, Africa, and some European or Asian primitivists (they're seen as some as the only Tradition to exclude based on race). Their dominant sphere is Spirit.

* Euthanatos: Known as the 'death Mages'. These Mages are distrusted by many of the other Traditions. They see reality as being clogged with those who should die but refuse to, those who need to be helped along, and those who want to die but are not allowed to. They act as both assassins and mercy-killers. They do not kill for pleasure, but to weed out the unproductive or dangerous souls to allow them to reincarnate into more productive forms. Their dominant sphere is Entropy.

* Order of Hermes: The former masters of the Mythic Age, these Mages are actually a collection of Hermetic houses that banded together for common protection from the Technocracy. They practice high Hermetic Magick, a collection of rituals, calculations, symbols, and props based in Egyptian and Hebrew mysticism. They are the remains of the legendary 'wizards' of old, reading crumbling manuscripts, scribing circles and pentagrams, and occasionally throwing fireballs from their fingertips. Their dominant sphere is Forces.

* Sons of Ether: The first of two former Technocracy groups that defected to the Tradition council. The Sons of Ether are more scientist than Mage, but, with a slightly crazy twist - they are the 'mad scientists' of Magick. They believe Ether, the unseen 'fifth' element, exists and must be brought to public attention and made to be popularly accepted. They left the Technocracy because other groups within that faction 'disproved' the existence of Ether to their horror and disgust. These scientist-Mages are as wacky and diverse as the Victorian era that gave birth to them. They each have a pet Theorem (and device) to prove (and construct). They can be recognized by their white lab coats, odd-looking Ether goggles, and their freaky assistants. Their dominant sphere is Matter.

* Verbena: This tradition is named for the Latin name of a cure-all herb commonly associated with 'witches'. And, these Mages are what gave witches the reputation they have - for both the good and the bad. Consorting with familiar animals, healing and herbalism, and using blood to power their Magick, are all elements of this tradition. They are known for dancing naked within a sacred grove, shape-shifting to animal forms, granting fertility to the fields and wombs of the deserving. They are the pagans of old, the founders of the New Age movement, and are as devout as the Chorus when worshiping their Mother Goddess. Their dominant sphere is Life.

* Virtual Adepts: The second of two Technocracy groups that defected to the Traditions. While technological devices form the focus of their science-Magick, they believed too much in freedom of thought and expression to remain within the Technocracy. These Mages work their Magick in the computerized world of Virtual Reality. They're the hackers and masters of the Internet. They coined the phrase "Information wants to be free". Adepts created cyberpunk literature and interactive video, and perfected the home computer in an effort to reach out to the world. While they are brilliantly elitist programmers who dedicate their lives to one-upmanship, they also campaign to get everyone online. For them, global Ascension will occur when every man, woman, and child has access to a computer and can tap into the 'Net. Their dominant sphere is Correspondence.

* "The Tenth Tradition/The Great Craft" Hollow Ones: Hollow Ones are the most open and obvious Craft of all non-Tradition groups. They will work closely with Tradition Mages most of the time. However, they are very much NOT a Tradition (despite their nickname), and both they and the Tradition Mages know it. Hollow Ones tend to self-Awaken. They are the dispossessed from every generation - the Flappers of the 20's, the Beats of the 50's, the Generation X of the 90's. They tend to be attracted to spooky, 'occultist'-style Magick such as playing with tarot cards and Ougie boards, communing with spirits, and translating fairy tales (the old gory versions) into Magickal effects. They have no dominant sphere, but have much more flexible rules about foci as a result.

* The Lost Traditions: The more perceptive reader will notice two seats and specializations are held by former Technocrats, and might wonder who, if anyone, held those seats in the misty past. There are two traditions known as the 'Lost Traditions'. One was the alchemical Solificati, who are rumored to have somehow betrayed the Traditions and were cast down from the seat of Matter and destroyed. The other was the Arabic religious Tradition the Ahi-a-Batini, who sacrificed themselves for the greater good in the war with the Technocracy in the fall of the Mythic Age.

=== The Nature of Magick ===

The Spheres: While a Mage's level of Awakening determines how much potential they have to affect the world around them with their Magick, Magickal knowledge allows them to actually do it. The 'Spheres' determine what sort of effects they can accomplish by breaking reality manipulation up into quantifiable groups understood by the human mind. These nine groups are: Correspondence, Entropy, Forces, Life, Matter, Mind, Prime, Spirit, and Time. Often Mages need understanding of more than one sphere in order to manipulate reality, and effects that combine spheres are called 'Conjunctional' effects. Since it's nearly impossible to master all nine spheres, most Mages concentrate in one or two spheres with minimal learning in the others (if any at all). Spheres are ranked from one to five, with the most basic information covered by rank one (recognizing the force being studied) to the most complex at rank five (complete Mastery of it). It's rumored that some Mages attain abilities beyond the fifth level; however, these 'Oracles' would be almost god-like beings and certainly cannot be found anywhere on the Earth. Still other Mages advance the notion that Sphere Magick does not completely define reality...that there are some unfilled 'holes'. These groups believe there is a tenth sphere that is unrecognized. Most Traditions, Conventions, and Crafts will have members that debate what the 'correct' tenth sphere is, how to access it, and why it remains hidden.

* Correspondence: The understanding of space and spatial relations. Correspondence deals with the difference between 'here' and 'over there'. Those who study Correspondence begin to understand that there is only one true location where everything exists (The Correspondence Point). It is only humanity's imperfect understanding of reality that makes us see things in relative distances. Correspondence can be used to affect far locations or to allow the Mage to teleport or spy on activities from a distance.

* Entropy: The understanding of the natural cycle of decay. Entropy deals with death, decay, system breakdown, and understanding the nature of seemingly 'random' events. Those who study Entropy can find the weakness in even the most 'perfect' object or system, accelerate breakdowns, and can control random events like the tossing of dice or the draw of lottery tickets.

* Forces: The understanding of natural forces and elements. Forces deals with electricity, fire, radiation, the atmosphere. Those who study forces can cause explosions, deny living beings air to breathe, create and extinguish flames, fly, and control the weather.

* Life: The understanding of the life force within all living items, including plants, animals, and humans (and beyond). It requires the object being acted upon to either be alive, or so recently dead that not all processes have shut down (a dying body, a picked flower still wilting, etc). Life deals with improving what is already alive, and even creating life. Those who study life can heal or harm another living being, alter their appearance and form (including shape-changing), and eventually create new life.

* Matter: The understanding of inanimate objects and how to effect them. This is the catch-all category not covered by the sphere of Life. In some cases, it may be difficult to determine what is Matter and what is Life. Those who study matter can change one kind of matter to another (lead to gold), repair broken objects, and even create new objects out of 'thin air'.

* Mind: The understanding of the mental processes of humans and other rational beings (supernatural creatures and 'intelligent animals'). Those who study mind can read thoughts or shield their own from prying minds, cause or heal insanity, transfer their own consciousness (including 'astral travel') or even create a new intelligent consciousness.

* Prime: The understanding of Quintessence, Tass, and the source of Magick. Prime deals with the manipulation, organization, and location of Quintessence, Nodes, and Tass objects. Those who study Prime can regain lost Quintessence, locate nodes, create and recharge 'Talismans', and even open new nodes or channel extra quintessence into Tass.

* Spirit: The understanding of the 'Umbra' (spirit-world) and areas outside the realm of Earth and their inhabitants. Spirit deals with ghosts (dead supernatural beings), spirits from other realms of existence and entering and leaving the Spirit realm. Those who study Spirit speak with and bind spirits, create Talisman-like 'Fetishes', and travel into the Umbra.

* Time: The understanding of the nature and progression of time, backwards and forwards. Time deals with the sequential occurrence of events that occurred in a particular location. Those who study time may 'fast forward' or 'rewind' time from within a few seconds (though actually affecting the past or future is forbidden to player characters) to centuries and longer. Those who study time can accomplish multiple actions at once, read 'psychometric' messages from items or locations, and eventually move through time backwards or forwards.

=== Magickal Flavor ===

Talismans and Foci: Foci (plural of 'Focus') are props and actions that are required by beginning Mages to work their Magick. Just as you would not expect a stage magician to be able to saw his assistant in half without the box and the saw (and the assistant), a Mage does not expect to be able to shoot fireballs without her Magic Wand, Lucky Rock, or Song of Power. As Mages advance their learning they outgrow the need for Focus objects, but beginning Mages cannot function without them. Some Foci are expressed through physical objects (the Magic Wand and Lucky Rock just mentioned). Others are represented by abilities learned by the Mage (the Song of Power). Talismans are similar the 'Magic Items' of old, though they can be found in any form from an engraved wand to a complicated technological gadget. They are objects specially prepared by Magickal means to evoke specific Magickal effects. Most Talismans store Quintessence in order to 'fuel' their effects, the idea has been proposed that normal mortals can use them, even though this isn't a proven fact.

Rotes: Rotes are specific rituals designed to make Magickal effects a bit less difficult. A rote can best be explained as being like a mini-Focus for ONE particular effect, though the Mage still needs to have the proper abilities and sphere Foci (if any). Most Magickal effects are 'on the fly'...a Mage will be in a situation where a sphere or spheres will be required, and create the effect. Rotes are pre-learned rituals that make certain effects less difficult. Some examples would be a birthing chant used by a Verbena midwife, a program written by a Virtual Adept to ease the entry into Virtual Reality, or a martial arts 'movement' necessary for an Akashic to break a board. These rotes will only be effective in those limited situations, but in those situations they do make Magick easier to accomplish (and sometimes coincidental).

Resonances and Essences of Magick: Magick effects and locations each often have 'Resonances'. The Resonance of Magick is like the 'signature' or 'flavor' left by Magick being performed in a certain area, or that affects a location. A location with resonance to Healing Magick (a hospital or church, for example) would be more conducive to non-aggressive Life Magick, while interfering with destructive Forces effects. A War resonance battle-ground might be more conducive to Entropy or damaging Life or Forces effects. The types of resonance are endless, and not every location has a particular resonance. However, most nodes and locations that hold importance to local reality do. Each type of Mage has an 'Essence', which shapes the type of Magick they do. Part of character advancement and increase in Magickal abilities is reflected in how the Mage keeps to their essence, which they are born with. The Essence of a Mage is the subconscious driving force behind their works. There are only four Essences. Any Mage can be any essence, but most traditions are drawn to a particular essence or two. Some, such as the Verbena and Akashic Brothers have divisions or sects for each of the four types. The essence can be thought of as the way in which a Mage seeks Ascension, or the driving force of the Avatar.

* Primordial: Known as the 'First Essence'. In the beginning of time all Mages were primordial, and then as civilization developed, the other essences emerged. They are most in tune with spirits and the earth and natural forces. Primordial Mages seek Ascension within themselves rather than achieving some outside goal. Euthanatos and Dreamspeakers are often Primordial Mages.

* Dynamic: These Mages are driven to seek new experiences and goals. They almost never actually accomplish what they seek, instead as they come close to it, they shift their emphasis to something new. Sons of Ether, Cult of Ecstasy, and the Hollow One craft are often Dynamic Mages.

* Pattern: Opposite of the Dynamic Mages, the Pattern essence represents those who try to create some sort of order and structure within the world. They seek to build rather than tear down. As such, the Technocracy is often seen as being affiliated with Pattern. However, many fine Tradition Mages are also drawn, including the Celestial Chorus, and Order of Hermes.

* Questing: Acting as a balance between the other essences, the Questing Mages are spiritual like Primordial Mages, driven to new experiences like the Dynamic, but also have some sense of order to their being like Pattern Mages. A Questing Mage will usually have one focused goal they constantly seek to accomplish. As such, they are the most common essence for 'most' Tradition Mages, including Virtual Adepts.

Specialty Spheres: Each Tradition has a specialty sphere. It is the least difficult sphere for members of that Tradition to learn, because of the overall Paradigm of the Tradition and method of instruction. Automatically, each Mage will start with a basic ability in that sphere. Other spheres can and most likely will be learned, and the specialty sphere does NOT have to be the one the Mage has the highest rating in, or even any real interest in. Therefore, if you're into Martial arts, but don't care about Mind, you CAN still play an Akashic Brother. The same with Verbena - you can still be a 'pagan' or 'Wiccan' sort of character and be more interested in some sphere besides Life. As long as you take the 'token' rating in a Tradition's specialty sphere (if you play a Tradition character), you can then focus on any other sphere (or spheres) you choose, within reason.

Aggravated Damage: Through the careful manipulation and control of some of the spheres...a Mage can create effects so damaging, that they cannot be healed (easily) by Magickal means. These wounds are referred to as 'Aggravated'. Aggravated damage includes fire, acid, Prime attacks, natural weapons belonging to other supernatural creatures (werewolf claws, vampire fangs), etc. When a Mage is damaged by a Paradox backlash, they take aggravated damage. Since Paradox wounds were granted by Reality's servitors, they cannot be healed by anything but natural means (waiting).

=== The Game World ===

The Tellurian: Tradition Mages do not describe reality as 'the universe' (that is the terminology of the Technocrats). They instead usually refer to it as 'The Tellurian'. The Tellurian refers to all that exists, including the spiritual realms that mirror the physical realm. While much information is speculation, at least some basic 'facts' have been gleaned.

The Realms: Pockets of reality that make up the Tellurian. The Earth is one of these Realms, as is its Near Umbra, and the Umbras that surround each of the planets and the Moon in the solar system. The Realm around the Earth's moon is called "Arcadia" and is believed to be the ancestral home of the fairies. However, it seems to be barred from any Mage entry. Each Realm is believed to have a 'physical' part (a correspondence to something in the 'known' universe such as the nine planets, the Moon, the Sun, etc) and an Umbral counterpart that mirrors it but is considered a separate location. There are also other, lesser, realms that have been categorized by the scholars of Spirit Magick. Horizon realms are the best known of these, bubbles of reality that shield the earth from the 'Deep Umbra' of space. They are 'maintained' with quintessence from earthly nodes and often act as strongholds or havens for groups of Mages. The reality is set by the Mages who control the location, and so all Magick that fits within the will of the controllers does not earn Paradox (making Horizon Realms important for Magickal research and construction). The natives or inhabitants of ANY realm outside the commonly-accepted reality of Earth are known as 'spirits'. Spirits have varying levels of 'power' and 'intelligence' as compared to Mages, but it is generally a wise policy to treat any spirits encountered with caution and respect.

The Near Umbra: A realm that mirrors the Earth but remains unseen by all except select Awakened beings such as Mages who learn the Sphere of Spirit and some other supernatural beings. It exists parallel to the earth and occupies the same space. It mirrors earth, but there are some differences on how things are perceived, and the denizens of the Near Umbra are incomprehensible to most. Those who move from the Earth to the Near Umbra or back transfer their bodies and immediate possessions as well, though they may take slightly different 'forms' in either realm.

The Deep Umbra: the vacuum of space. It is difficult to travel and inhospitable (often deadly) to earthly life. There is only one Deep Umbra, and it extends to the infinite reaches of the Tellurian. Only the bravest and most knowledgeable of Mages would risk traveling the Deep Umbra, and this includes the Void Seekers of the Technocracy.

Three Umbras: Between the Deep Umbra and the Near Umbra is a three-fold layer of Realms known as the "Low", "Middle" and "High" Umbras. Each has their own geography and smaller pocket Realms. The Low Umbra is the realm of death and ghostly spirits. Mages who journey into the lands of Death must be prepared to never return, as few but the Euthanatos and Dreamspeakers ever do. The Middle Umbra is the realm of spirits and is most often traveled by the Werewolves, who lay claim to it. Travel in the Middle Umbra is marginally safer for Mages than the Low Umbra, but, only the Verbena and Dreamspeakers are the most safe; all other run the risk of destruction by hostile spirits or shape-changers. The High Umbra is the realm of Mages and the source of all intellectual delights. While no Mage is guaranteed safety in the High Umbra, there is the least level of calculated risk involved. The High Umbra is most dangerous in areas where Technocracy Mages have carved out complexes, or where the spirits are disinterested in human contact.

=== Creating Your Character ===

While the actual statistics will be gone over during the first session, you will need to 'plan out' the basics of what sort of character you want to play. Keep some important points in mind:

# Mage is a game set in modern times. While your character can be any natural age range from about 18 to 50 or 60, no extended lifespans, time travel, etc. allowed in backgrounds. That is, the character must have been born within the past 60-odd years and led a completely natural life. It does not have to be 'normal', just natural :). Also, it occurs in the World of Darkness, which is *basically* just like the world we live in, but just a little bit dirtier, grittier, and less pleasant than our own world. While Soviet Union has still collapsed, Political Correctness never took off.
# All starting characters must be Mages. All Mage characters must be 'human'. Fantasy races need not apply. Other 'races' exist in the World of Darkness, however, they are NOT Mages. (A character could be a Mage or a Vampire, not BOTH). I may consider running alternate games, or allowing 'crossover' characters, but both those options are so far ahead in the future as to not be considered now.
# Mages do not 'dungeon crawl' or 'hack-and-slash'. There *are* options for combat, however just killing things that get into your character's way interferes with the storyline instead of furthering it. Creating a 'combat machine' will not get you much of anywhere (but dead as you decide to attack the innocent-looking bag lady who happens to be an Oracle in disguise).

That said, there's nothing to prevent a character from having an *interest* in fantasy or other genre-based hobbies. Conceivably, a player could want an 'elf-like' character. While they could NOT have a true elf, they could play an Orphan Mage who's inspiration for Magick comes from Tolkien. This tall, skinny character might have memorized the elvish languages provided in the backs of the books to construct simple chants, document Magickal research in a collection of official "Lord of the Rings Daily Calenders" and even have slightly pointed ears from a Magickal effect gone bad in the past. Or, they could be an Order of Hermes Mage who dresses up in "those funny renaissance faire clothes" and whose collection of battered AD&amp;D texts act as a real source of "spellbooks". The possibilities are endless, once you keep the game setting in mind.

Consider what type of person and type of Mage you'd like to play. The whole motivation of a Mage is their Paradigm. And, their Paradigm was mostly shaped by their normal, non-Magickal lives. One source of character inspiration is to consider the 'types' of characters you play in other games (do you prefer a combative warrior, a contemplative spell user, or compassionate healer?) Another option is to try to think about playing *yourself* suddenly granted control over reality - including your interests, hobbies, strengths, and weaknesses. The Tradition stereotypes are there for a reason, and provide a good starting point for players new to the game.

Some questions you should prepare answers for:

What Tradition and Essence will your Mage be? If he's a Hollow One, do you want him to have a specialty sphere and Foci, or be more like an Orphan? Why did he gravitate towards the Tradition he chose? If he's not in a tradition, why did he become a Hollow One, or avoid training to end up an Orphan? Did he become an Orphan by choice, or was he 'passed over' or 'rejected' by the Tradition he would have chosen? Not every Orphan was forced to be that way, many prefer the freedom of self-study even if it is more difficult.

What will her true personality be like, and what 'facade' will she present to the world?

What are the basics of his Paradigm, including preferred foci for Magick. Choose which spheres you're most interested in: list three of the nine explained, with a fourth as an outside possibility. Keep in mind that if you play a Tradition Mage, the specialty sphere must be one of the ones you choose.

Will she be more intellectual, more socially adept (attractive and convincing), or more physically strong and sturdy?

Where and when was he born? What ethnic background is he from? Is he American or foreign? What, if any, mundane training, education, and employment did he have?

How does her Avatar appear to her in the alter-ego form? Is it a voice inside her head acting as a conscience? An angel of death with bloody hands? An animal totem spirit? A servitor of the God(dess)? A tempter-type opponent (not all avatars are positive - a lot of role-play can occur with a negative avatar who basically 'spanks' or 'tricks' the Mage into learning)? A talking robot who only animates when communication is needed? A literal 'ghost in the machine' of a computer? The possibilities are as endless as the Paradigm choices.

=== The Breath of Life ===

More than anything, Mage is about role-play. It can easily become a power gaming experience, if characters are not well-developed. I do NOT want to see that happen. I really want this game to be as much possible fun to run as I'm hoping it will be for you to play. Which means you have to work with me, and dedicate at least some time to working on your character before you play.

What I'm asking for is about 2 hours of time spent working on the basic ideas for what sort of Mage you want to play. Pick 3 spheres that sound interesting. Write out a basic background mentioning the sorts of things you think your character should have an affinity for. Show me you're willing to put some thought into the character before the game begins, and I can then help translate that information into game stats. You have to have a *personality* to work with before assigning stats in this game, or the character will be hollow, and not much role-play will occur with it. Spend particular time working on the Paradigm and Avatar of the character, as well as the basic facts of the past.

Hopefully, reading this document already gave you ideas on what sort of character you'd be intrigued by playing. Now all you have to do is put those ideas on paper.

=== Investing in the Game ===

There's not much you need to start playing. The game mechanics are fairly simple, and will be gone over in the first session. If you want to play, you should invest in your own set of six to ten 10-sided dice, it would make things much simpler than asking to borrow other players' all the time. If you decide you want to continue to play, you may want to invest in the core rulebook, 'Mage: The Ascension Second Edition'. All other books are less important.
