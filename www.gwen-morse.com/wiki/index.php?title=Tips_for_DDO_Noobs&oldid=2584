<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Tips_for_DDO_Noobs">Tips for DDO Noobs</span></h1>
<p>So, you've made a new character on DDO. You've learned how to leave Korthos, find groups, use the chat, (maybe) check your mail and use the Auction House. But, you can tell you're not getting the most out of your character and you're not sure *why*.
</p><p>DDO has a very sophisticated character building system and it's easy to be caught in some very dangerous traps.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Eachna.27s_Rules_for_Noobs">Eachna's Rules for Noobs</span></h2>
<ul>
<li> Make choices that limit being a "burden" to the party. Don't expect 100% of your healing to come from healers. Don't expect 100% of dealing with traps to come from trappers. Don't expect only arcane casters to provide crowd control, or only archers to provide ranged damage. DDO is designed to be a group-based activity, however, you should always work on being an asset to any group, not a leech. There are a number of ways to increase your self-sufficiency.
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li> Buy potions. There is a nice vendor in the Marketplace (aptly named "Potion vendor") who can sell you a wide range of potions. Buy the best level of Cure potions you have access to (the more red in the icon, the more it cures). Buy Curse Removal, Fear Removal, Disease Removal, Poisoning Removal, and Blindness Removal. Buy Lessor or Greater Restoration. If you're low on platinum, buy 10 of each. If you have the cash, buy 100 of each. They are consumables, but they last a good long time. 100 of each of these potions will probably last you into epic levels.
</li>
<li> If you can cast some sort of cure spell on yourself, for goodness sakes, USE IT. I've lost track of the number of paladins, rangers, light monks, artificers, bards, and favored souls who don't use their self-healing abilities and gripe about dying. If you have a cleric in the party they _can_ heal you. However, they're also looking after the fighters, barbarians, rogues, dark monks, wizards, and sorcerers in the group. Cut them a little slack and look after yourself when you can. If you take a lot of damage and need a big heal they'll still be able to throw it your way.
</li>
<li> Learn where the traps are, and learn how to jump over/run through traps. Several types of traps can be (mostly) avoided by skilled movement. For example, some traps can be avoided if you run down the center of a hall or hug a particular wall/edge. Fire and acid traps can often be "jumped over". The corollary of this is don't be stupid and "trap with your head". Don't just blindly storm down every hallway because you have to be first to the kill. If you don't have good Spot, and there's a trapper in the party, hang back just a little and let them take the lead. I don't care how awesome you think you've designed your character to be...if you've died in a trap you're useless until someone else can help you out.
</li>
<li> On the subject of trappers, the difference between a trapper whose an asset and a trapper whose a burden is their gear. +1 or +2 skill gear will not cut it at level 13. Trappers can normally increase their skill-boosting gear by +1 every two levels, and they should do this at least until they hit +13 gear. There's usually a few extra levels of "breathing room" before they need +15 gear. The first two trapping skills to max out with skill points are Search and Disable Device. If you have more points left over, then Spot. Only if you have even more points left should you max out Open Locks. Once your skills are maxxed, you should get the highest skill boost gear you can use at your level. When buying random generated skill-boosting items in the Auction House, don't pick ones that have two effects. You "just" want a Spot item or "just" want a Search item. Named loot is different. The Goggles of Perception from the free-to-play Tempest Spine raid (for example) give +10 Search and +10 Spot in one item and can be useful for several levels. The unsuppressed Dark Blue Ioun stone from The Dreaming Dark gives +15 Spot and +15 Listen from level 5 and up, which makes it the best Spot item in the game (until you're in epic levels). But, when in doubt, pick out items that only have one effect.
</li>
<li> Learn to collect (and use) "clickies". These are items with a certain number of charges per rest. The first clickie every character gets is the Ring of Waterbreathing from the end chest in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://ddowiki.com/page/The_Grotto">the Grotto tutorial</a>. I like to run the Sharn Syndicate chain each life because I usually get offered at least one item with a clickie in the reward list for each quest. Expeditious Retreat clickies help you keep up with the faster people in the group. Aid clickies lend you a few extra hit points. Prayer and Heroism clickies are both worth their weight in Large Devil Scales because they help you increase your chance at making skill rolls. Every trapper should carry a Heroism clickie at lower levels, and Greater Heroism at higher levels.
</li>
<li> I used to put Balance on all my characters. I've since cooled on it. While it does have a (small) impact on how quickly you stand up, it has no effect on whether or not you get knocked down. Jump, however, is universally useful. It can allow you to reach high perches, to avoid traps, and reach quest objectives. I would recommend choosing Jump before Balance. If you have the skill points to spare, both are useful.
</li>
<li> Learn what Crowd Control options your class has. Every build type has some sort of crowd control. Melees get attacks like Sap, Stunning Blow/Stunning Fist, and Trip. Casters usually get spells. Ranged combat types may also get spells, or simply control crowds by killing targets from a distance. There are some wands or items that can be used for limited crowd control. Blinding enemies is a form of crowd control, as is Fear-ing them.
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li> Don't be "That Guy". In my first serious raiding guild on the Orien server, our guild leader would spout reminders and then finish them up with the tag line "Don't be That Guy". So, she'd say something like "Make sure to pick up Curse pots...don't be That Guy" (ie: the one player who doesn't have potions to remove curses). "Make sure to hand in the raid now that we're done...don't be That Guy" (ie: the one person who forgets to collect the raid reward at the end, shows up 3 days later on the next raid day, and discovers they have to wait ANOTHER three days to be able to run it again). That advice absolutely works...I still think "Don't be that guy" when I finish every raid or I notice I need to resupply some consumable. I'll add more as I think of them, but here are some That Guy things to avoid:
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li> When you finish a raid, hand it in immediately. There's a 3 day timer that starts from the time you collect your end reward. It keeps you from running the raid again until it finishes. If you forget to collect your reward, that timer never starts ticking.
</li>
<li> When you're going to do the Caught in the Web raid, make sure to have a stack of 100 potions of Remove Curse.
</li>
<li> When you're going to do the Against the Demon Queen raid, make sure to talk to Zawabi the Djinni *twice*. The first time you talk to him, it clears a flag from the last time you did the raid. The second time gives you the pre-raid quest. Also, when you're entering the pre-raid quest, double check that you don't have a message in red stating you haven't picked up the quest on the quest box. If you _do_ have a message in red, go back to the refuge and talk to Zawabi again (because you were That Guy).
</li>
<li> Don't share the pre-raid for Vault of Night. If you do and anyone accepts it, you'll make them unhappy.
</li>
<li> Don't forget to bring an Underwater Action item when you're going to do Shadow Crypt flagging. One of the flagging quests is 90% swimming underwater.
</li>
<li> Don't forget a Deathblock item any time you're going to face beholders. Also don't forget to equip it.
</li>
<li> Double check a character you haven't played for a while is flagged _before_ you join the raid group.
</li>
<li> Tower of Despair has a special mechanic to teleport your character to the raid entrance if they visit it once. Run out to the raid entrance and get access to the teleporter while you're doing the flagging quests. Don't wait for raid day to get around to it. Don't forget your Boots of Anchoring. One of the bosses has a power that will kick you out of the raid if you don't have the boots. This means you will end up doing all the work and getting none of the loot.
</li>
<li> Also for Tower of Despair. If you're not a light monk, don't forget your Pale Lavender Ioun stone. If you don't have a pale lav, don't forget your Jewelled Cloak. The final boss's stun can be mitigated by spell absorption items.
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li> Get yourself some Adamantine Ore. One of the first things I do when I create a new character is to use one of my epic characters to go farm the free quest <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://ddowiki.com/page/A_Relic_of_a_Sovereign_Past">A Relic of a Sovereign Past</a>. One of the first things I do when I find a new noob who is looking for instruction, is to teach them how to farm the quest for themselves when they're at the right level. For this quest <b>MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A RETURNING THROWING WEAPON</b> (buy one in the Auction house or somewhere else). In short: get the quest (the quest giver is hidden in the bowels of House D). Enter the quest (the quest entrance is hidden in the bowels of House K). Run down the first hall. Turn left. Look for a door guarded by two dwarves, with a pull lever to open it. Open the door. Pull the next lever to open the gate. Run down the long hall and check each side room. You're looking for a room with a chest. Loot the key in the chest. Run out of this hall back to the main room. I always forget whether you turn left or right at this point, but now you're looking for a big round door with a key hole in the center. Unlock the door. Pull the lever to raise the gate. Run down the hall. Watch carefully as you run down the path with a metal track in it. You're looking for large purple gems that are labelled "Adamantine Ore". Follow all side branches. When you come to a force field with a target at it, hit the target with your throwing weapon. Unlike most targets, you _can't_ activate it with your hands. Run up each a side corridor, pull a lever to raise a gate, run in, loot the adamantine ore in each cubbyhole of the mine. When you've completed this successfully, you should have at least 13 pieces of adamantine ore. The last one or two pieces will be in the final room. There are exactly 15 pieces of adamantine ore in each run. Kill anything hostile in the final room, and talk to the only guy left standing. He'll make you Nightforge gear with the ore you just collected. I -always- for -every- toon farm: Nightforge Gorget, Nightforge Armbands, Nightforge Helm. I also like to grab a Nightforge Spike if I have the time for that final run. I carry each character's Nightforge gear from level 8 to their max level (because the clickies are useful).
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Wear items that give you fortification. The reason for that long explanation about the adamantine farm is that one of the items (the Nightforge Gorget) gives you Heavy Fortification at level 8. I can't stress this highly enough. The more fortification you have, the less damage you take. The less damage you take, the less cures or potions you need. The less you die. The less of a burden you end up being, and the more you become an asset (going back to my very first point).
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Cleric (and Favored Soul) hirelings get a little bit of a bad rap. The hireling AI in DDO is pretty awful. Hirelings will stand in Area of Effect spells (while taking damage). They'll stand in lava (while taking damage). They'll run through traps, and stop in the middle (while taking damage). If there's a way to stand in one spot and take damage, hirelings will find that way. I'm not going to pretend they're wonderful marvels of modern computer programming. But, the thing that gets people most incensed is that the healer hirelings don't heal. There's a trick to getting them to heal, and it's pretty simple. If you're low on hit points, RUN TOWARDS THE HIRELING. I've figured out through pure observation that hirelings have a very short line of sight. If your hireling isn't healing you (and they have spellpoints), if you run close to them they'll suddenly "perk up" and cast a healing spell. Give it a try if you don't believe me.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Learn to swap accessories. I group similar items in the same quickbar. So all my helms go in one area, all my gloves in another. If (for example), I run into a ghost while on my paladin, I can swap to her Ethereal Gloves and be able to hit it. Then, when that combat is over, I can swap to her regular gloves. If I'm on my rogue and I'm having trouble finding the trap box, I can swap to her Nightforge Armbands, use the Heroism clickie, and then swap back to her regular bracers when Heroism is cast.
</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Learn_the_Roles">Learn the Roles</span></h2>
<p>There are a number of roles in DDO, most of which can be found in other MMOs.
</p>
<ol>
<li> Casters or Spellcasting. A number of classes are given spells in DDO. Most offensive spells are limited by "DC" (Difficulty check) and possibly "SR" (spell resistance). DC-based spells require an investment in the class's "Casting stat" to have the best chance of being effective. You want to put as many build points as possible into your casting stat, spend extra points on enhancements, hunt down a good Tome, and get the best gear possible at your level in order to increase your casting stat DC.
<ol>
<li> Divine casters. These are Clerics, Favored Souls, and Druids. To a lesser extent, Ranger and Paladins have divine casting options. "Divine" spells are granted by gods and do not incur "Arcane spell failure" from wearing metal armor. Divine casters all use Wisdom as their casting stat.
</li>
<li> Arcane casters. These are Wizards, Sorcerers, Bards, and Artificers. Wizards and Artificers use Intelligence as their casting stat, and are further limited by having to acquire scrolls of varying levels of rarity to learn their spells. Sorcerers and Bards use Charisma and do not need to scribe spells from scrolls.
</li>
<li> Healers, Buffers, Necros, Crowd Control, and Nuking. While there are a wide range of spells and effects in the game, there are a few very commonly used terms that are helpful to know. Healers "heal", that is, restore hit points to their group members. Buffers cast spells that make individuals or the group better at their particular roles. Necros (or Necromancers) use instant-kill spells to take out opponents. Wizards and Sorcerers are the most common Necros, but Clerics and Favored Soul builds are also popular. Crowd Control casters, "control crowds", that is, they stop groups of enemies from attacking by forcing them to engage in useless activities (like lying down, being stunned or dazed, dancing in place, or simply standing still). Nuking refers to using spells to do a large amount of damage, usually of a particular element (ie: an "acid nuker" has focused on acid-based spells).
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> Melees engage in hand-to-hand combat with opponents. There are a number of weapon styles for melees, including Two-Handed Fighting (large weapons held in two hands like great swords or great axes), Two Weapon Fighting (dual-wielding), Single Weapon Fighting (a single one-handed weapon used like a fencing rapier), Sword and Board (A one handed weapon paired with a big shield), or Unarmed Combat (a martial-arts based monk).
</li>
<li> Ranged combat. Most casters use ranged spells. In addition, there are short and long bows, crossbows, repeating crossbows, and throwing weapons (axes, daggers, hammers, and shuriken). Some classes, particularly Rangers, Monks, and Artificers, are very easy to turn into effective Ranged Combat specialists.
</li>
<li> Trapping. Rogues and Artificers are the only two classes given access to trapping skills (open locks and disable device), although other classes can sense or find traps (using spot or search).
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: While on the topic of roles, try to refrain from telling other people how to play their roles, particularly in relation to your character. There's a bit of a running resentment that people tell clerics to "shut up and hjeal me" (a deliberate typo because "h" and "j" are next to each other on a QWERTY keyboard and may be typed together by a panicked player). Some people like to tell arcane casters (particularly aretificers and bards) that their only job is buffing the group, or that rogues should just trap and stay away from combat. (Lack of) Trapping and Healing are the two roles that can grind an otherwise effective party to a halt. Crowd Control is often useful enough that it shouldn't be overlooked. But, the people who play characters that have access to those roles may not want to limit themselves to focusing on supporting your backside through a quest. Simple courtesies like "Please", "Thank you", "Would you be willing", "May I have" go a long way towards building party unity and leading to a successful quest completion.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="What_Class_Should_I_Play_to_Get_In_The_Most_Groups">What Class Should I Play to Get In The Most Groups</span></h2>
<p>The simple answer to this question used to be cleric. It's a free class, "everyone" wanted a healer, and they were something of a scarce resource. In high-level epic play, the game has changed a lot from those days. Most epic builds are self-healing. If you want to show up to Epic raids as a Cleric, you better have more in your tank than "just healing". You should be able to necro or nuke with light spells.
</p><p>For lower heroic play, clerics are still a strong contender. For the first three to five levels (or so), a cleric is actually less useful at healing than cheap potions purchased from vendors. Once you get over that early hump it's fairly smooth play, especially if you have experience with playing a healer in other MMOs. You'll have your problems (rude people, people running off and dying, lost people), but those aren't specific to your role.
</p><p>Also very useful is a wizard/trapper or ranger/trapper. Experienced players can be a bit impatient if you don't have the locations of every trap in the game memorized (from sheer repetition), so it will be important to mention that you're new to the game and could use pointers on finding trap boxes. If you announce this, usually someone in the group will be happy to play "spotter" for you. Watch the group carefully as often the spotter will simply stand in one spot and jump up and down when they want you to search for the trap box, rather than typing or saying something. You may also find yourself in the bewildering situation of being accepted to a group of experienced players who all bounce effortlessly through the traps and leave you behind. In that case, you've been included to disable trap boxes and earn everyone the trapping XP bonus. *ALSO* in that case, you're only expected to avoid dying and to go at your own pace (no one will spot for you but you don't have to rush at a breakneck pace to keep up with everyone). I've learned to enjoy these runs when I play a trapper, as it's usually mostly combat-free for me. 
</p><p>A melee is also useful, but where possible, you should consider a self-healing/self-buffing melee. Paladins, Rangers, and Bards are all stronger contenders than a barbarian or fighter. Barbs and fighters are both very respectable classes and I don't mean to denigrate them at all. Unfortunately <b>for new players</b>, they're completely dependant on others to keep them alive. They have no gear, past lives, favor, or game knowledge to get themselves through quests without depending on the kindness of others or hirelings (or both). A light monk or artificer can also be self-healing melees, but they're pay classes, and their players need a certain amount of game knowledge to make them function properly.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Bravery_Bonus_is_a_Trap.21">Bravery Bonus is a Trap!</span></h2>
<p>Bravery Bonus is a trap! 
</p><p>I'm sure plenty of experienced people will disagree with this statement, but honestly it is. "<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://ddowiki.com/page/Bravery_Bonus">Bravery Bonus</a>" is a system coded into DDO whereby players get the maximum XP return from doing quests on the elite setting chosen so they exactly match up to their level. A level 6 character would therefore do a quest that's listed as level 4, on elite, which increases that quest to level 6. It's a simple enough concept and probably makes sense. "I'm playing a level 6 character so I should be doing a quest at level 6." However, a quest that's elite and on level 6 is not the same difficulty as a level 6 quest on normal. An elite level 6 is closer to a level 8 or 9 quest on normal. With a new player who hasn't stuffed their storage bank with the best gear, you end up with a level 6 character with level 2-3 gear, trying to do a mislabelled level 8 quest. If they can't handle it, they get told they suck. No one bothers to explain how the system works.
</p><p>It becomes even more confusing because people will do things like announce their "streak" numbers, and jealously guard them. "I can't do this quest on Hard, I have a streak of 800". It implies to the noobs that those 800 completions are better than a lower number. The truth is that you only need an elite streak of 5 to get the maximum benefit from Bravery Bonus. If they do _this_ quest on hard, after five more elite quests they'll be exactly where they were before. The streak element of Bravery bonus is an e-peen score, not an xp boost.
</p><p>The people who can best make use of bravery bonus are experienced people who have played through many lives. The same people who tend to avoid noobs. Because noobs are undergeared, get lost, and die a lot. A person playing through their first life of their first character on DDO is better off finding a small group of like-minded people and using the same system to do quests on "Hard". You live more and get xp faster. The game becomes much less stressful and much more fun. Also, I'll let you in on a secret. A lot of the super hardcore players who solo all the content and finish 20 levels in a week run quests on Hard instead of Elite. Hard quests complete so much faster that they get more xp per minute doing Hard instead of running Elite.
</p><p>Since there are ways to farm xp potions in the game, I now dedicate a certain amount of time to doing that, and then I force myself to break my streak a few times each life as I level. It can be a little painful (who doesn't like to see a big number score), but it helps me get through quests that are too hard for me to do on Elite, or to group with people who are going slower in Hard quests.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="UMD_in_DDO">UMD in DDO</span></h2>
<p>If you're a rogue or an artificer or a wizard...consider putting points into Use Magical Device every level (maybe also ranger and bard). <b>Even though you don't know what it can be used for</b>. These are classes that have lots skill points and can afford to spend some points to explore a new skill. "UMD" is awesome, even on a first life character. In fact, in a way, it helps level the field a little for new first life characters. In it's simplest form, what it does is allow you to use magical items you wouldn't normally be able to use. Two of the most common items are wands and scrolls. But, what it -really- does is let you take on roles that are not part of your character class. An expert in UMD can cast buffs buff and heal and even do some spell-based damage even if they don't have a single spell point. 
</p><p>It can be a little confusing to new players because they look at a wand or scroll or item and it says it needs UMD 20, or 30, or 38, and they don't see how they can get the skill at their level. The trick is that it's a Charisma-based skill and your Charisma bonus is added to your UMD skill, and there are a couple items that boost it as well. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://ddowiki.com/page/Use_Magic_Device">Here is the full breakdown.</a> When you hit epic levels, that's when it really shines!
</p><p>What I do is put max skill points (11 or 23 ranks) into UMD. I find two rings that have the same icon (so I can recognize them). Then I use Cannith crafting to add in crafting prefixes and suffixes.
</p><p>Ring one, which I use at level 20:
</p>
<pre>Prefix: Charisma +6
Suffix: Persuasion +3.
Yellow slot: +150 spellpoint augment
</pre>
<p>Ring two, which I change to at level 24:
</p>
<pre>Prefix: Charisma +6
Suffix: Persuasion +3
Yellow slot: +200 spellpoint augment
Colorless slot: +2 exceptional charisma
</pre>
<p>The spellpoint augment just lets me do two things with the same item (boost casting power while also boosting UMD). With a nice UMD ring and a decent Charisma score I can UMD any scroll I might have an interest in using.
</p><p>I've been in raids where all the healers died and I was playing a rogue. I switched over to heal scrolls and healed the tank. As the proper healers were available to be raised, I raised them, and basically "saved" the raid. Her UMD skill and her ring is what let my rogue do that.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Useful_Things_to_Do_With_Throwing_Weapons">Useful Things to Do With Throwing Weapons</span></h2>
<p>Returning throwing weapons are somewhat unappreciated heroes in DDO. A returning throwing weapon acts like a magical boomerang. You throw it, it hits a target and then returns to your hand. Most people call them 'Throwers' as a nickname.
</p>
<ol>
<li> Blunt throwers are useful to smash perched skeleton archers.
</li>
<li> As mentioned earlier, throwers can be used to hit distant targets, and aerial targets. These usually trip levers to lower bridges or open gates.
</li>
<li> Greensteel throwers can be used to make a wide range of clickies. Several greensteel weapons can be made with useful click powers (stoneskin, displacement, raise dead, etc). You usually only need the shavarath stone and small/medium materials, which makes them "cheap" (at least from a greensteel perspective). Weapons, unlike accessories, don't need to be cleansed of the Shavarath taint. So, you swap items to the thrower, use the clickie, swap back, and you're good to go.
</li>
<li> Lailat in the Against The Demon Queen raid likes to hide on a distant ledge. A thrower is useful for non-casters to keep doing damage to her. Hint: You want Cold Iron to help break her damage resistance. The crystal in the Fall of Truth raid can only be targeted by ranged attacks (including throwers). Alchemical Crystal will break its damage resistance. 
</li>
<li> The Nightforge Spike is a handy minimum level 8 adamantine thrower that you can get by handing in Adamantine ore. I like to place a random elemental damage augment in the red slot and fling it at anything that needs ranged damage. The spike itself doesn't break the damage resistance on much of anything, but the elemental augment does do damage each hit.
</li>
<li> If you aim it at a distant enemy you can annoy them and 'pull' them closer to you. A few of their neighbors may follow but you shouldn't get the whole pack.
</li>
</ol>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Farming_Free_Quests">Farming Free Quests</span></h2>
<p>Read the wiki and learn to farm the free quests. There are some amazing items to be found in the free to play quests, many of which are as useful, or more useful, than items found in the pay quests. The more experience I get at playing the game, the more I realize that a fair amount of the old reliable free gear is actually the best in slot (or at least competitive for that position).
</p><p>Before my time, loot was designed under a different paradigm than during the past few years. It used to be that the loot designers made sure there was what might be described as solid "core" gear available in the free quests, and it was expected that players would gear all of their characters primarily from the free content. Pay quests were meant for situational swap-in gear. The older gear is therefore cohesive and different items fit together neatly with just a few items from pay quests. The newer gear often has bigger numbers but it lacks the cohesive elegance of the older gear.
</p><p>Here's a short list:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Sacrifices. The humble Sacrifices quest in the Korthos Island tutorial area results in an end reward list that always includes the boots "Anger's Step". These free boots have a twice-per-rest Expeditious Retreat clickie. The quest can be run as many times as you want and will always produce the same reward list. I usually grab two pairs of the boots per character, plus whatever item I need to make my set.
</li>
<li> The Collaborator. Also on Korthos, this quest is given and completed in the Tavern. Since I usually play Undying Court clerics, or paladins (both of which can use scimitars), I usually grab the scimitar named Fintan's Bite. It's a ML: 1 scimitar with Bodyfeeder, and a little boost to the jump skill. Bodyfeeder is a power that usually shows up in the high single digits or low teen minimum levels of random loot. This sword is a little bit of a hidden gem in low level free gear.
</li>
<li> Walk the Butcher's Path. Not much in here is useful (random loot is probably better in most cases). However, I've become quite fond of the Jade Ring. It's a ML: 1 item with a colorless augment slot and Resistance +1. I like to slot the special augment Master's Gift in the colorless slot for a +5% XP bonus from first level. While the ring comes from a free to play quest, the augment is made from loot from two pay quests. 
</li>
<li> A Relic of A Sovereign Past. Heavy Fortification at level 8? Yes, please! All the items from this quest have their uses, but the Nightforge Gorget is a stand out prize. I like to stick Fear Immunity augments in the yellow augment slot.
</li>
<li> Tempest Spine. The only free raid, and the only raid you can run multiple times the same day without a raid "bypass". There's "something for everyone" in this raid. Most items are level 8 or 9. I'm particularly fond of the Cloak of Invisibility, with Ghostly, a green slot (good for Resistance +3) and a once-per-rest Invisibility clickie. Other shining examples are Maelstrom, the Goggles of Perception, the Choker of the Silver Tongue, and the Robe of Arcane Puissance and the other Robe of Potency. Those last two robes have identical stats and simply drop in different chests.
</li>
<li> Invaders! This is a bit of an unusual quest as you farm tokens and turn those tokens in for items. The Ring of Balance is useful for everyone (best for True Neutrals but any alignment can get use out of it). I also really like the Scepter of Healing. When you play a lot of clerics an item that gives Devotion and a red slot for extra spell power is really nice. When it also lets you use your Wisdom as a bonus for To Hit and Damage, well then it becomes "must have".
</li>
<li> Xorian Cypher. This quest is routinely farmed at level for a belt called the Planar Gird. It's pretty rare (I only have one and I've played steadily for several years). To be completely honest, the belt is not really "all that". I mostly keep it for bragging rights. If a newer player pulled one I'd suggest they consider trading it for something more useful to them.
</li>
<li> Lordsmarch Plaza Chain. Three quests that are the home of the Sora Kell set. The last quest (Eyes of Stone) is also the home of a nice set of heavy armor/docent, and the much-loved Stonedust Handwraps.
</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Gearing_for_the_True_Reincarnation_Train">Gearing for the True Reincarnation Train</span></h2>
<p>This is slightly more advanced than some of the previous information, but there's no reason you can't plan for later lives while on your first life. It assumes you have access to all the content in the game, and have some common items (usually bound to account or unbound) on a bank storage toon (a "mule"). 
</p><p>All Cannith Crafted items presume Masterful Craftsmanship which lowers the minimum level by 2. 
</p><p>Craftable trinkets can be looted as rare items (more common during the winter games) or created from Shards of Power found in the Shroud. All my TR's end up with at least two craftable trinkets.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Korthos: Make sure I have their set and their backup set. "Their set" is whatever is most useful for their primary class. The backup set is usually the trapper set (because I usually splash trapping on a TR), the mnemonic necklace (on any blue bar at all), and a couple pairs of Anger's Step boots. I grab a pair of Feather Falling Boots from the bank mule. Make sure they have their clickie water-breathing ring from the free stuff Jeets passes. Gear is pretty relaxed at this point and it's not uncommon for me to have an empty gear slot or two because I want to jump into quests.
<ul>
<li> Korthos Set gear usually takes up boots, gloves, necklace, and/or goggles.
</li>
<li> Armor is craftable special metal (usually mithril, could be darkleaf instead). Casters get Bound to Account robes, each has their own color-coded set of robes. Monks get Bound to Account outfits (also color-coded). Armor is usually bound to character and stored in their TR cache. Pull whatever it is out and craft Invulnerability on it.
</li>
<li> Belt: BTA from a mule. Craft False Life +10 (minimum level 2).
</li>
<li> Craftable Trinket: +10% Melee alacrity.
</li>
<li> Gloves: Gloves tend to be "whatever" but trappers get 2 pairs of BTA gloves from a mule. One pair will get the best Disable Device skill boost for their level, the other pair will get the best Open Locks skill boost for their level.
</li>
<li> Main ring: "Whatever" (usually boosts a stat or skill they need). Off-ring is, for now, a Jade Ring slotted with Master's Gift. In the future I will farm up craftable rings with colorless slots and re-slot all my augments.
</li>
<li> Weapon: BTA from a mule. Screaming of Bleed in whatever item they will specialize in (ie: greataxe users get a BTA greataxe). Fintan's Bite if they can wield it. 
</li>
<li> Blunt weapon (for skellies and incorporeals): Ghost Touch of Righteousness. Throw a +1 on it once they get a few levels.
</li>
<li> Rustproof Weapon (for oozes): BTA qstaff from a mule. Craft Screaming of Everbright. Throw a +1 on it after they get a couple levels. 
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 3rd/4th level. Quick gear juggle.
<ul>
<li> Weapons: Everything stays the same (except this may be where I start dropping in +1's on the items that can take them and throwing in a Lifeshield boost if I have the time). Pull out Carnifex if the character can use it. If Carnifex is being used, pull out the Antique Greataxe.
</li>
<li> Bracers: BTA Bracers of Wind from the Cannith Challenge pack. Perma-blur with ML: 3.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 5th level. First serious gear breakpoint. Abashai Gear. This is where I pull out my first set of fancy items!
<ul>
<li> Abashai set. Default is all 5 items. In my particular case _every_ character I have (other than bank mules) has a full 5 piece set, but I'm a packrat. Most players only bank one or two sets, total. Some characters may remove items as they have better gear for specific slots. I'm experimenting with replacing the bracers with the Bracers of Wind.
</li>
<li> Ioun stones for swap. Casters get a Deep Purple Ioun stone. Everyone gets a Pale Lavender Ioun stone. Trappers get a Dark Blue Ioun stone. Anyone who doesn't have a permanent-in-slot Ioun stone keeps their +10% Melee Alacrity trinket, or gets a suitable Cove trinket.
</li>
<li> The main Korthos set stays on (pull off Shocking Gauntlets if needed).
</li>
<li> Armor/Robes: Add Lifeshield if not done at 4th level.
</li>
<li> Belt:  Re-crafted with +20 or +30 False Life (whichever one fits).
</li>
<li> Weapons: Pull my "Delera's Beater" off the mule. Pre-crafted and stored. +1 Ghost Touch of Lesser Undead Bane on a Flametouched Iron BTA quarterstaff. One of my paladins has a silver maul with a red augment slot and I usually craft it for Delera's as well. Hers becomes Ghost Touch of Righteous.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> After the 4th and 5th level re-gearing I usually take advantage of any down time to Cannith craft and fill in missing boosts based on the class and needs of the character.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 7th level. Second Gear Breakpoint. Red Fens Gear.
<ul>
<li> If a divine, put on the helm.
</li>
<li> If a trapper, put on the trapper set.
</li>
<li> Everyone gets the Marshwalker set (ring and boots). Off-ring continues to be Jade Ring. This breaks the Divine Blessing set and I'll have to sort this out for the future. I may be able to get away with +20% striding boots (depending on ML) and just use Expeditious clickies if I feel too slow or when I need waterbreathing. This set stays on until the character reaches 18th Level (it's just that good).
</li>
<li> Gloves: I used to always swap in the Claw set for anyone meleeing (which is everyone, even future casters, at this level). Now that I'm grinding and gearing everyone with Bracers of Wind, I will probably keep them in their Shocking Gauntlets.
</li>
<li> There can be a bit of gear crafting at this point to fill in missing boosts.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 8th/9th Level. Third Gear Breakpoint. Tempest Spine Gear. This is a big breakpoint and I basically re-slot all my gear. Any lingering Abashai gear goes in the bank. This is when gear starts to get a little "serious". There is focused Cannith Crafting based on the present and future role of the character. Everyone will end up with maximum False Life, some extra Constitution, appropriate skill boosts (usually trappers). 
<ul>
<li> Armor: Heavy Armor swaps to the Gorgon Plate from the Lordsmarch Chain. Robe wearers switch to the Robes of Potency if they have them. If they don't have Robes of Potency they upgrade to the best enchantment boost with Lifeshield and Invulnerability for their level.
</li>
<li> Cloak: Cloak of Invisibility slotted with Resistance +3. If the character is missing this item, put on their ML: 8 Mabar Cloak. 
</li>
<li> Trinket slot: If there's no permanent-in-slot Ioun Stone, the Craftable Trinket may be updated to have a bit of Devotion or Good Luck (whatever fits), along with the Melee Alacrity. If they were using a Cove trinket they will probably swap to their first crafted trinket. All characters get a Kaelth's Touch swap-in Trinket from their bank. 
</li>
<li> Neck: Nightforge Gorget slotted with Fear Immunity (Paladins need a different augment, maybe Blindness Immunity?). Caster Divines get a Choker of the Silver Tongue and slot Heavy Fortification in their robe's blue augment slot. Necklace of the Silver Flame usually gets pulled out for swap-in deathblock. 
</li>
<li> Helm: Divines keep their Fens Helm. Others may get a BTA crafted helm with a useful stat boost.
</li>
<li> Goggles: Trappers get Goggles of Perception (or crafted search goggles if they don't have them yet). Others may get BTA crafted goggles with a useful stat boost (+4 Attack, or Melee Alacrity if they don't have it in the Trinket).
</li>
<li> Weapons: This is where weapons start to vary by character. Carnifex or the Antique Greataxe may still be in use for the last few enemies before casting becomes very effective. Maelstrom may be in use. A heroic Sword of Shadow will come out of the bank if they have one and are set up to use it. A Sword of the Thirty augmented with Devotion or Radiance may come out of the bank for melee divines who 'need' that red slot more than the extra critical multiplier on a SoS.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Somewhere between 9th and 13th level I'll re-craft ooze and undead beaters (assuming they don't have a Triple Positive greensteel) and do the final +13 skill boosts for Trappers. After the full 9th level re-slot it's mostly a series of small gear juggles.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 10th/11th level.
<ul>
<li> Weapons: Caster Divines will slot a Dalorent's Seal and a Scepter of Healing, if they have them. Augments will likely be Nullification and Impulse (for necro divines) or Combustion and Impulse (for nukers who use fire).
</li>
<li> Greensteel accessories come out. If they have a "Smoke" greensteel item with perma-Blur, the ML: 3 Bracers of Wind will finally be banked.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 12th/13th level. At the end of this breakpoint all characters should have their signature weapons for this life. This is the point where +6 stat gear and +15 skill gear starts being slotted.
<ul>
<li> Sora Kell sets come out for those who can use them.
</li>
<li> Light armor wearers will swap to their Crimson Chain. If they don't have Heavy Fortification elsewhere they'll make sure to have a Nightforge Gorget augmented with Fear Immunity.
</li>
<li> Greensteel weapons come out. Particular favorites are Mineral II scimitars and Triple Positive blunt weapons.
</li>
<li> Goggles: Trappers get Tharnes Goggles and I get to stop holding my breath every time I Search on a trapper stuck in Goggles of Perception.
</li>
<li> Gloves: Divines get their Gauntlets of Eternity (upgraded, of course).
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 14th level. 
<ul>
<li> Armor: "Whatever" armor or robes gets swapped for heroic Gianthold dragon scale.
</li>
<li> Neck: Since only white dragon scale wearers get Heavy Fortification, the old trusty Nightforge Gorget usually gets hauled out again. The neck also continues to have Deathblock from the Silver Flame.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 18th level. This is the last gear juggle before TR at 20 or epic levels.
<ul>
<li> Boots: Boots of Propulsion come out and the Marshwalker set is finally retired. The boots stay out as a waterbreathing swap item and the ring gets shoved back in the bank. 7-18 is a long stretch to tie up two gear slots but as noted earlier I don't have a good solution for Striding. Bound striders for each character is a bank slot I don't feel I can afford.
</li>
<li> Cannith Sets come out of the bank (by class/role). Trappers get the Tinkers Gloves (as I don't yet have ANY Tinker's Goggles). Clerics get the Alchemist's set. Melees get the Fabricator's Set. My bard, artificer, and any wizards get the Magewright's set.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At 20th level I either immediately (or nearly immediately) True Reincarnate again, or, break out the Cannith Challenge epic gear and the Eveningstar Commendation gear set. Even with a character focused on getting multiple lives I may have a reason to run them at epic levels for a little bit. Most often it's that they're missing high level heroic gear (Ioun stones are a common item, Tharnes Goggles for trapping are another) and so I may want them to farm older quests or raids. The other likely reason is there's a new pack out with bound gear they will want later.
</p><p>Notes about TR gear in no particular order...
</p>
<ul>
<li> Bracers of Wind + Cloak of Invisibility is some serious "win" on a TR. 20% Blur (Concealment) and 10% Ghostly (Incorporeal) with a green slot (which is good for either Heavy Fortification or Resistance, depending on the build). It's just a whole bunch of stacking mitigation that can be useful until 20, or greensteel Blur, or Wapriest perma-Blur, etc. I plan on farming those cloaks on all my characters and I already have a few pairs of bracers to swap around.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> I really like the Nightforge Gorget slotted with Fear Immunity. I started using Fear Immunity augments on my clerics because a raid healer who is feared can't clear the state (Fear prevents potion drinking and spell casting), and epic Gloves of Immortality have a yellow slot. Fear is one of the few states that can shut down a character but still has an "immunity" option (most immunities have been broken by the developers).
</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Help_For_Paladins">Help For Paladins</span></h2>
<p>Paladins in DDO are not like Paladins in other MMO's. DDO Paladins have a reputation for being useless. The developers of the game have systematically squashed every element that made paladins effective, culminating in killing tanking as a play style, and passing paladin's Sacred bonus over to fighters (who had no need of it). Paladins follow the 3.5 pen-and-paper rules as far as their saving throws, skill points, and feat options, but are stripped of their mounts and a significant section of their spell book. Their smites and auras exist, but are crippled as well.
</p><p>It's a running argument about whether bards or paladins do less damage, and which are more hated by the developers. Bards have been improved through the recent Swashbuckler enhancement prestige, and the devs have hinted that Paladins will soon follow. However, the early signs are that paladins will continue to have poor damage capability even after they're updated. 
Paladins have the dubious distinction of being possibly the only DDO class to be weakened by staying "pure" and having 20 paladin levels. Other classes can benefit from careful multi-classing, but no one complains if a "pure" wizard or "pure" rogue or "pure" fighter shows up. Paladins are the only class to be harmed by NOT multi-classing. From a pure numbers standpoint there's not many compelling reasons to play a character with more than 4-6 levels in the class (which is a sad state). 14 levels of paladin is the maximum you can even feebly justify as they get a spell that gives them a small doublestrike bonus at that level.
</p><p>That said, I absolutely love the class. When you want a character who can take a beating and keep moving, paladin is the choice for you. They don't do all that much damage, but they're probably going to be the last to die. As a final caveat, it can be hard to find groups to accept them as most players know how little damage they do. 
</p><p>I have several paladins named Eachna, scattered across the assorted servers. My "main" Eachna is on Orien, and has battled through three increasingly frustrating pure paladin lives. For her fourth life, I wanted to play her as a fighter to get that past life feat, but I wanted to play her as if she were a paladin (using the same gear and similar spells). I found a build on the DDO forums <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.ddo.com/forums/showthread.php/426765-Kensei-Warpriest-for-new-players-%28Human-12-8-Fighter-Cleric">the Kensai Warpriest</a> that would let me do that. Cleave + Great cleave + Divine Power and Divine Might is a potent combination. I hadn't realized just how bad the tight feats are on a paladin until I played a fighter with so many feats they could afford to waste some on metamagics. I'm toying with build notes for a 14 or 15 paladin build with the rest in levels of fighter. Fighter would be used to get Tower Shield proficiency and the oh-so-precious fighter feats. She needs two more fighter lives (they will be done as the Kensai Warpriest), and probably three cleric lives (for the boost to Turn Undead), before I can take her back to paladin.
</p>
<ol>
<li> Her first life was a human two-handed fighter. She fought with falchions. I managed to pick up a nice silver falchion with a medium guild slot.
</li>
<li> Her second life was a drow two-weapon fighter. She started with rapiers but I switched her to khopeshes. I picked up a pair of silver khopeshes, one with a small guild slot.
</li>
<li> Her third life was a half-elf two-weapon fighter, using khopeshes. I farmed a pair of Radiance II khopeshes, a painful consumption of twelve large devil scales, just in time for the devs to put the last nail into two-weapon paladin DPS. I also farmed a pair of Celestias and multiple sets of Stars of Day. I ground out her destinies and she mostly ran in Shadowdancer as an <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.ddo.com/forums/showthread.php/396525-Theorybuild-The-Angel-of-Death">Angel of Death</a>. She stayed in this life for over a year and toured the raid scene. It was hard to find groups for her as she didn't have tank gear and as previously mentioned Paladins have low DPS. I mostly had to depend on the kindness of friends to allow her tag along on relaxed runs. After she completed her epic Sword of Shadows, I reincarnated her into a fighter/cleric.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is my hard-won experience in playing pure paladins, and what did and didn't work.
</p><p>Two weapon fighting was a better source of damage, until the enhancement pass and tank death killed the last scraps of paladin potency. Paladins are now better off being two-handed weapon fighters. Sword-and-board is an option, but it's pretty abysmal. Stalwart defender (the fighter tank prestige class) is a better tanking option if you 'need' a tank for an old raid. They get all their old bonuses and a few new ones, and the changes to the Sacred bonuses are in their favor.
</p><p>Divine Might was nerfed, so much so that even using strength-boosting gear is somewhere between tricky and useless, but a side-effect of that nerf was that Tactical feats (stunning blow, sunder, trip, sap, etc) are suddenly viable on a paladin. This is why I'm running her in fighter lives, for the tasty boost to Tactics that the Fighter past life feats grant.
</p><p>Until I get the past lives straight and have a specific build, I'd suggest 14 paladin levels and 6 fighter levels. This gives you access to Zeal (a vital paladin spell), the full Kensai tree, and a nice assortment of feats. Use Kensai to favor Great swords or Great Axes, whatever your best-in-slot weapon will be.
</p><p>Feats I recommend: Take the two-handed fighting chain (Two Handed Fighting, Improved Two Handed Fighting, Greater Two Handed Fighting) and the Great Cleave chain (Power Attack, Cleave, Great Cleave). You'll want either Improved Critical Slashing, or Improved Critical Piercing, depending on whether your endgame damage will come from a two-handed sword or greataxe or real bastard sword, or a faux bastard sword like the Star of Day or Celestia. If you want to use a bastard sword, take Exotic Weapon Proficiency Bastard Sword. Since you have some extra feats take Empower Healing Spell and Extend. Take Weapon Specialization in whatever type of weapon you're using. Then, spend your last couple of feats on whatever you'd like for flavor (maybe a little shield bashing, or Magical Training, or Quicken

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Re-Playing_Threnal_.28Farming.29">Re-Playing Threnal (Farming)</span></h2>
<p>Most people who have played the Threnal pack hate it. However, to make your Gift of the Master XP augment, you'll probably want to play it twice. That's once for the heroic cloak and once for the augment. Here's how to reset a character who played it once to do a short form of the adventure. You will get the chain reward list at the end.
</p><p>From the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://ddowiki.com/page/Ruins_of_Threnal">DDO wiki</a>: "To do a fast-repeat of the chain simply check your journal, if it has West, East and South listed as completed, select West and abandon it. That will reset South and West but will keep you flagged for East. 
</p><p>Once you have completed West again, speak to Sal Danek and ask "is there more to do here" and this will open the Southern Excavation set of quests again. (Can be done with East as well, but who wants to defend Coyle for 15 mins?) Do a fast Casual run for end reward."
