<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="My_Toons">My Toons</span></h2>
<p>My intent is to level up all the healing classes and see which one is most fun for me to play and more useful in raids. No matter what happens I'll likely play Eachna often as I reserve her name for my intended main toon and I find I enjoy playing the Rune Keeper class.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Eachna_of_Brandywine">Eachna of Brandywine</span></h3>
<p>Eachna is my main.
</p><p>She is an elvish Rune Keeper. Rune Keepers have two discrete magic roles, DPS and Healing. They can specialise in Fire Damage Over Time, Lightning Direct Damage and Debuff, or Heals Over Time. They can be powerful raid healers (or powerful DPS), but due to the way their powers work they're slower than other classes at each of their roles.
</p><p>Mounts: Steed of the Eastemnt, Red Clad Horse of the Gap, 2014 Yule Steed of the Winter Winds, 2015 Yule Steed of the Ithilien Winter, Prized Thorin's Halls Goat, Prized Rivendell Steed, Prized Tundra Steed, Prized Mathom Society Steed, Prized Eglan-Horse. Of these Eachna rides the Prized Eglan-Horse when she's not on her Light build spotted grey War Steed.
</p><p>Craft: I've given her the Explorer Vocation which means she'll be harvesting raw materials for crafting. She has the forester, prospector, and tailor crafts. She also has the Fishing hobby.
</p><p>Guild: She's in the Tailor's Guild as a level 88 Explorer.
</p><p>Skirmish Soldier: She's running a female elf Bannerguard named Rinitalia. I have no idea what the name means, I pulled it from a name generator.
</p><p>This is the recommended list of virtues for a Rune Keeper: Innocence, Zeal, Charity, Compassion, Fidelity.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gamberella_of_Brandywine">Gamberella of Brandywine</span></h3>
<p>This is a loose approximation of a gemstone name for a hobbit. I like to start my character names with the letter "G" (unless they're a variation of Eachna), and hers is "G-amber-ella", like Cinderella but with Amber. 
</p><p>Gamberella is a hobbit Minstrel. She's my second play toon, although she's been benched till Eachna reaches level 100. I realized levelling two toons at once felt like too much of a grind.
</p><p>Mounts: Steed of the Eastemnt, Red Clad Pony of the Gap, 2014 Yule Steed of the Winter Winds, 2015 Yule Steed of the Ithilien Winter, 2015 Treasure Laden Goat.
</p><p>Craft: I've given her the Tinker vocation, which means she'll be cooking, jewelry-making, and prospecting. She also has the Fishing hobby.
</p><p>Guild: She's in the Jeweller's Guild as a level 30 Tinker.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gallali_of_Brandywine_.28n.C3.A9e_of_Elendilmir.29">Gallali of Brandywine (née of Elendilmir)</span></h3>
<p>Gallali was originally on Elendilmir, but was moved as part of the 2015 Server Consolidation. She's an elf Minstrel. Since I already have a Minstrel I suppose I'll use her to farm TP in the future or be an extra crafter or some sort of mule.
</p><p>Mounts: Steed of the Eastemnt, Red Clad Horse of the Gap, 2014 Yule Steed of the Winter Winds, 2015 Yule Steed of the Ithilien Winter.
</p><p>Craft: I've given her the Woodsman vocation, which means she'll be doing woodworking, forestry, and farming. My plan is to use her to make minstrel instruments for herself and Gamberella, as well as whatever other wooden items will be useful.
</p><p>Guild: She's in the Woodworking Guild as a level 21 Woodsman.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gealowyn_of_Brandywine">Gealowyn of Brandywine</span></h3>
<p>Gealowyn is a human female Captain. She has a Bannerman who acts like a hireling or summon and provides her with buffs. She may eventually be levelled to be a raid healer.
</p><p>Mounts: Steed of the Eastemnt, Red Clad Horse of the Gap, 2014 Yule Steed of the Winter Winds, 2015 Yule Steed of the Ithilien Winter.
</p><p>Craft: I made her a Historian. This is scholar, farmer, and weaponsmith.
</p><p>Guild: She's in the Scholar's Guild as a level 50 Historian.
</p><p>Bannerman: I am using a Shieldmaiden named "Skjaldmaer" which is Old Norse for shieldmaiden.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gwinwin_of_Brandywine">Gwinwin of Brandywine</span></h3>
<p>She's a clothes mule.
</p><p>Craft: I've given her the Armorer vocation, which means she'll be metalworking, tailoring, and prospecting. 
</p><p>Guild: She's in the Metalworking Guild as a level 19 Armorer.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gzelle_of_Brandywine">Gzelle of Brandywine</span></h3>
<p>She's a second crafts and storage mule.
</p><p>Craft: I've given her the Yeoman vocation, which means she'll be cooking, farming, and be a tailor.
</p><p>Guild: She's still grinding her way to guild membership

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Healing_In_LOTRO">Healing In LOTRO</span></h3>
<p>Minstrel are "reactive" healers. Damage comes in and the healer activates a skill to restore the missing health. Reactive healers only fix damage after it's happened (they react to specific attacks). Reactive healers tend to be very good at dealing with large damage spikes, but may have problems with maintaining enough Power to last through long fights.
</p><p>Runekeepers and Captains are "proactive" healers. Rather than waiting for damage to the target's Morale they cycle through a sequence of small Heal over Time effects that (if done properly) restores Morale in timed ticks. Proactive healers anticipate attacks before they happen. Proactive healers tend to have trouble dealing with large damage spikes, but have low-cost skills that allow them to sustain their Power pools through long fights.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Minstrels are the "easiest" healing class to play well in the game. They have the widest range of potential healing boosts/skills. If you want to see the biggest healing numbers floating by, Minstrels are perfect for you. Minstrels specialize in burst heals. 
</li>
<li> Captains are the most flexible healing class. While only rarely a main healer, they can shift between DPS/Heals/Tanking very quickly and it's normal for them to play all these roles in group play. Captains specialize in group heals-over-time that are triggered by their DPS attacks, and have a wide range of buffs that make everyone better. 
</li>
<li> Runekeepers are probably the "hardest" healing class to play well in the game, but they're very rewarding if you take the time to understand their skills. Runekeepers specialize in heals-over-time, both single-target and group effects.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The general consensus on the LOTRO forums is that all three healing classes are good at what they do (proactive burst heals, backup heals with strong DPS and bufs, reactive healing over time) and no one single class is clearly "best".
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Runekeeper">Runekeeper</span></h3>
<p>Runekeepers play as a cross between a traditional Wizard and a traditional Cleric. They have both burst damage and damage over time, and heals over time. They also have some stuns and debuffs for crowd control.
</p><p>They're a completely fabricated class. There's no analogue for them in the Middle Earth books. Once you overlook that, they can be a "fun" class. They output a lot of damage, have very good heals, and have a lot of flashy visual effects.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Attunement">Attunement</span></h4>
<p>Runekeepers use a builder/spender system based around their attunement meter. There are three types of attunement: battle, healing, and steady. Attunement is the play system that differentiates Runekeepers from the other classes.
</p><p>"Battle" attacks tend to do damage (either direct damage or damage over time) and push the meter towards combat attunement. The more the battle side of the meter is filled in, the more damage each attack does at the cost of progressively weaker heals. When attuned to battle the meter is orange.
</p><p>"Healing" effects tend to restore morale, cleanse states, or create bubbles, and push the meter towards healing attunement. The more the healing side of the meter is filled in, the more morale each effect restores at the cost of progressively weaker attacks. When attuned to healing, the meter is green.
</p><p>"Steady" effects tend to have crowd control effects, debuffs, or do small amounts of damage, and help move to the center balance point of the attunement meter. When at steady attunement the meter is empty.
</p><p>As a very general rule of thumb, a particular fight will involve either building healing _or_ combat attunement. Fights tend to be too fast to switch between the two. While a Runekeeper can easily switch roles between fights (for example, aiding in killing trash mobs with Battle attunement and then switching to Healing attunement when a Boss shows up), it's rare to switch in the same fight.
</p><p>If an emergency happens and there is a need to switch, Runekeepers have several options, including Steady skills, cash out skills, and the Steady Hands skill. 
</p><p>Steady Hands is a general skill unlocked by all Runekeepers. Using it switches the Runekeeper from one attunement to the opposite (Healing to Battle, or Battle to Healing). It doesn't work with Neutral attunement.
</p><p>All three trait lines (Red, Yellow, Blue) have special "cash out" abilities. These quickly spend all battle or healing attunement and put the attunement meter at the neutral steady point. 
</p><p>As already mentioned, using Steady effects pushes the meter towards the neutral point, which also aids in changing attunement.

<p>Gear Slots:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Runestones: The Runekeeper weapon. They are mostly used when smacking mobs in the head ("auto-attack"). The damage type (electric, frost, fire) doesn't matter all that much but the secondary effects on some stones are quite useful. Use crafted runestones (a jeweller can make them) as soon as you can as they're better than looted stones. Read each item carefully and decide which one you want to use.
</li>
<li> Satchels: The Runekeeper bag. This is a special equipment and cosmetic slot that only RK's have. Like other gear the bags can be enchanted. Use crafted bags as soon as you can (a tailor can make them) as they're much better than looted bags. Keep your starter bag (or store a copy in the Wardrobe) as it can be dyed to match your outfit and is good for those who prefer a sleek/minimalist look. The bags you can buy in the store can't be dyed and the bags you can get crafted are more bulky and ornate than the starter bag. There are three lines of crafted bags: one each to boost Battle, Steady, and Healing attunements. 
</li>
<li> To Color Your Satchel: The starter satchel can be dyed, and so can the crafted satchels made by Tailors. The satchels sold through the store cannot be dyed.
</li>
<li> To Hide Your Satchel: You can currently hide the satchel by equipping the first Legendary quest reward bag you get in Moria as a wardrobe item for your character. This removes the satchel cosmetically from your character.
</li>
<li> Rifflers and Chisels: These occupy your ranged item slot and hold enchantments. You have to choose either a Riffler or a Chisel as you can't slot both items. They have a wide range of effects, so like runestones read each item carefully and decide which you want to use. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't keep these three items slotted and upgraded as you level, you're ignoring a lot of power your character could be wielding. There are no Legendary versions of rifflers or chisels but there are crafted items every few levels right up to cap. 
</p><p>When levelling your Legendary gear, it's a good idea to level a Healing runestone plus satchel for group healing, and a DPS runestone plus satchel for solo play. That way if you're invited to a group where you're expected to function as a healer you're prepared for the event. If you don't want to carry two full sets of role gear then you can "make do" with one DPS and one healing item but your output for both roles will be weaker than players with two sets.
</p><p>Runekeepers can't equip a shield. Even though it's not really clear when looking at the animations, using Runestones occupies both hands.
</p><p>Consumables: I'm still taking the time to understand the various consumables.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Legendary_Accessories">Legendary Accessories</span></h4>
<p>When planning your Legendary gear, it's a good idea to level a Healing runestone plus satchel for group healing, as well as your usual DPS runestone plus satchel for solo play. That way if you're invited to a group where you're expected to function as a healer you're prepared for the event. If you don't want to carry two full sets of role gear then you can "make do" with one DPS and one healing item but your output for both roles will be weaker than players with two sets.
</p><p>For people who don't want to devote a lot of resources to healing, a pair of dedicated Third Age items would be an acceptable option.

<p>Note: Legendary scrolls that convert damage to a specific type (like Westernesse) only work on melee auto-attacks for Rune Keepers (which is only a fraction of RK damage). This means only the secondary effects on these scrolls are of any interest.

<p>Runekeepers restore Morale with heal over time effects. They have strong single target and group skills.

</p><p>Runekeepers can have a little bit of a bad reputation because of their reactive heals. It's very easy to play a Runekeeper badly, while a Minstrel almost plays itself. But with a patient and skilled player, a Runekeeper can heal just as well as a Minstrel while spending a fraction of the Power.

This goes in your "ranged" slot on your paper doll, the same slot as a Herald Armament (we used to have to choose between herald or banner, but no longer do).

<p>Housing in LOTRO is very nice. For about one gold you can get a small house with several decorating slots and a storage chest useable as shared storage for all characters on the account. There's a short quest chain given by the Housing Agents which provide you with some starter furniture items, as well as very inexpensive items sold by housing vendors.
</p><p>For about 7 gold you can get a large house which has a larger floor plan with an additional room and a lot more decorating slots than a small house. It also has one storage chest.
</p><p>If you take up the fishing hobby you can visit a Fishing Taxidermist to stuff any trophy fish for free. You can mount them on your wall as a nice decoration. There are a lot of items you get as loot from doing instances and raids that can be turned into decorations. Finally, you can craft decorations using recipes earned from different reputation barter NPCs in the assorted regions of Middle Earth. Every production crafter can make some sort of housing decoration.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Bree_Housing">Bree Housing</span></h4>
<p>I bought a house in the Bree homestead.
</p>
<ul>
<li> I feel the "best" Bree starter home is 1 Garden Street. It costs 1 gold as it's a small house. It's near the entrance of the housing lot, as well as being close to the center where the vendors and Vault banker are located. There's a small break in the fence that leads down to the water for fishing. I think it's a nice place to set up and get used to the way things work while trying to find the perfect large house.
</li>
<li> I think the "best" Bree deluxe home is 2 Garden Street, with 4 Long Street as a runner-up. Like 1 Garden Street they're close to both the center and the entrance. They each cost about 7 gold. Long Street is slightly further from both the center and entrance than Garden Street, but only by one row of houses. The two together would be perfect for a couple or kin-mates who want houses next to each other.
</li>
</ul>
<p>When I say "about" 1 or 7 gold, each house price includes a small silver fee for maintenance.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Storage">Storage</span></h3>

<p>Related to storage are:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Wardrobe

<li> Barter Wallet

Farming
My advice if you want to focus only on one crop per tier for the ingredient you'll most likely use as a cook over time is as follows per tier:
1- spring barley
2- taters
3- green onions
4- winter barley
5- golden shire taters if you plan to make soups/trail, otherwise blackberries
6- royal taters if you plan to make soups/trail, otherwise mint
7- black barley
8- rye

Spring and Winter Barley as well as carrots, mushrooms and yellow onions will be needed constantly for soups tiers 1-6. At tier 7, leeks replace barley, and at 8, the usual pattern of soup ingredients gets thrown out the window. Some farmable ingredients hardly ever get used (cauliflower, for instance). Some things like tea and coffee only matter a whole lot when you have LIs and want the LI xp boost which are cooking Guild recipes, and coffee will usually replace tea as the characters using them level. (Coffee without Guild access is only good for rping having the beans as far as I know.) Overall you will use these the most per tier:
1- spring barley, carrots, mushrooms, yellow onions
2- blueberries, taters
3- green onions
4- winter barley, shire-apples
5- golden shire taters, blackberries
6- mint, royal taters, green peas
7- black barley, bilberries, leaks
8- rye, turnips

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Pipe_Weed">Pipe Weed</span></h4>
<p>The information on pipe weed is from this thread: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.lotro.com/forums/showthread.php?543026-Fungo-Fuzzy-Leaf-Pipeweed">Rare Pipeweed</a>
</p><p>Okay I finally figured this out tonight, and since this is the thread that came up when I was searching for it I'll document it here even though it's old.
</p><p>-They changed pipeweed farming a few years ago, so disregard old howtos that involve making hybrids. Recipes from a given tier now simply have a chance to drop rare seeds for that tier AND THE NEXT (that last part's important)
</p><p>-You'll notice all the recipes for Artisan tier and above require rare (purple) seed drops. To get to Fungo's Fuzzy Leaf or Gold-Fire Pipe Weed at Supreme Tier, you must begin at Expert tier.
</p><p>-Note that you can buy soil at the vendors that give GUARANTEED CRIT on fields. I've managed to farm for a couple years now without realizing this. You want to crit on every field you plant as it ups the odds of rare seed drops.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Begin with the highest tier recipes you can craft with vendor-bought seeds: Old Toby, Shire Sweet-Leaf, or Sweet Galenas. I assume these three have the same rare drop chances, but do not know. Lengalenas will not work. Plant and harvest many of these fields, amassing a collection of rare seeds. Don't forget to use vendor-bought Rivendell Soil for 100% crit.
</li>
</ul>
<p>This will yield four types of rare seeds:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Dragon's Breath, Roper's Twist (Expert Tier)
</li>
<li> Eagle's Nest, Gamwich Braid (Artisan Tier)
</li>
</ul>
<p>After you have some rare seeds: 
</p>
<ul>
<li> Now, the Eagle's Nest and Gamwich Braid are the ones you need to proceed. However, plant and harvest all four types until they're exhausted, as all four can yield another of any of these four rare seeds including themselves. When planting Eagle's Nest and Gamwich Braid (don't forget the Lórien Soil!), in addition to the four rare types above you also have a chance to get Wizard's Fire seeds.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Now plant and harvest your Wizard's fire seeds (again with Lórien Soil). By this point you probably don't have many - I started with about 100 plantings in step 1, and after exhausting all the seeds generated in step 2 I had maybe 10 Wizard's Fire seeds to plant. The Wizard's Fire fields have a chance to drop another Wizard's Fire seed, Fungo's Fuzzy Leaf, or Gold-Fire pipeweed seeds. If you are lucky, you will get some of the latter two. If not, start over at the first step.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Go back to your house, light a fire, down an ale and enjoy that delicious, rarefied pipeweed.
</li>
</ul>
<p>TLDR- you can get Fungo's Fuzzy Leaf seeds from fields of Wizard's Fire, Gold-Fire, Fungo's Fuzzy Weed. You can't get to the latter two without some Wizard's fire seeds.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fishing">Fishing</span></h3>
<p>Technically fishing is a Hobby, not a Craft, but this is the best place to put it. It's a source of crafting materials (fish can be cooked), and is required for some optional quests.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Legendary_Items">Legendary Items</span></h2>
<p>Legendary items are part of the epic crafted gear system. They are the end-game "grind" items you farm, upgrade, and refine to perfection.
</p><p>You can get your first legendary weapon by completing Volume 2 book 1 of the epic quest line. When you hit 45 Elrond will send you to the the walls of Moria where you do a nice little intro quest chain which will give you your first Legendary Weapon. You pick up the quest itself by talking to the dwarf at the gate in the south-eastern part of Eregion (close to Echad Dunann). It's usually suggested waiting until you are level 46 because most mobs will be red at 45. Whether you do the quest at 45 or 46, you'll want to wait until around level 50 to enter Moria as the content is much harder than Eregion.
</p><p>In order to actually enter Moria, you'll need to level your weapon to 10 by using it when killing mobs. Then go either Thorin's Hall or to the Rivendale crafting area and look for the gold rings on the right side as you enter. Talk to the Legendary Forgemaster.
</p><p>Your first legendary items are "starter" gear and you should expect to replace them with better items. Later legendary items are found as loot.
</p><p>In order to take your first weapon past 20th level, you have to finish Volume 2 Book 1. That means you have to go finish up the Watcher in the Lake. If you have not finished Volume 2 Book 1, you will not be able to advance your starter Legendary weapon past 20th level, nor will you be able to bind new Legendary weapons or items. Finishing the quest allows you entry to Moria and gets you your first Legendary class item.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Deconstructing_Legendary_Items">Deconstructing Legendary Items</span></h3>
<p>Legendary items that have a minimum equip level lower than 5 or so levels below level cap are grinding gear. If cap is 100, then items from equip level 95-100 are items that will be used as your best gear and should be slotted with your best relics and scrolls.
</p><p>Anything between 51 and 94 (while cap is 100) is used as a form of item experience storage and rune creation. Grinding items will be broken down to create the runes and item experience tokens that will be fitted into those prime 95-100 items.
</p><p>You will typically get back a single tier 1 relic if you deconstruct an item without levelling or slotting it. The higher the level the better your chance of getting back multiple relics of tier 1-4.  The best levels to deconstruct legendary items for their relics are 2, 11, 21, 31, 41, and 51.  The best levels  to deconstruct legendary items for their xp runes are 16, 26, 36, 46, and 56. If you level a legendary to at least level 30 (or better at 31) before deconstruction, you will be able to choose one of the legacies on it to put on another item. This is done via a scroll you receive upon selection. The legacy scroll will be set to tier 1-2, not the tier it was on the item. This is done to collect a set of 'perfect' legacies for your wielded legendary items.
</p>
<ul>
<li> For items used by a different class, first determine if you can pass them to a toon of the appropriate class (an alt, a kinship member, a friend, selling through the AH). If not, then identify them and then immediately deconstruct them. You're basically removing them from the game database in exchange for a single tier 1 relic.
</li>
<li> If you're on your first toon or otherwise have no stored assets, it can be worthwhile to deconstruct your first few items at level 11 to get more basic upgrades to fit into your two starter Legendary items and to be able to experiment with the systems.
</li>
<li> While at character level 41 to 80, it's best to level the legendary items to 31 and then deconstruct. It's commonly agreed this gives the best ratio of invested item XP to returned relics, gives a legacy scroll, and allows you to begin levelling another item for the same benefits quickly.
</li>
<li> While at character level 80 and up, it's best to level the legendary items all the way to item level 51 before deconstruction. For each of your final Legendary items that you'll be imbuing, you'll need about 9-12 million legendary xp. It's commonly agreed that deconstructing at 51 (or 56) gives back large xp runes and the highest tier of relics which can be used to create relics for the final item. Deconstructing at 56 would give back the best xp runes and the best relics.
</li>
<li> While at character level 95 and up, it's best to collect a set of complete legacy scrolls 
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've played a few toons and have a very good supply of items in your account (shards, marks, runes of experience) and understand the system well enough to min-max everything, you can level every item to level 51 or level 56 before deconstruction.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Crafting_Relics">Crafting Relics</span></h3>
<p>To craft the lowest tier of relics simply needs raw materials. Higher quality relics require pages from the Compendium of Middle Earth. These pages can be purchased in Skirmish camps or can be farmed from a daily repeatable quest.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Compendium 1. Talk to the relic master at Anazarmekham in Moria for the quest <i>Trace Metals</i>. TRAVEL ROUTE FROM BREE: South Bree to Great River to 21st Hall to Anazarmekham.
</li>
<li> Compendium 2. Talk to the relic master at Ost Galadh in Mirkwood for the quest <i>Silken Strands</i>.
</li>
<li> Compendium 3. Talk to Bron at Galtrev in Dunland for the quest <i>Forges of Isengard</i>. TRAVEL ROUTE FROM BREE: South Bree to Galtrev.
</li>
<li> Compendium 4. Talk to Frinoth next to the forge in the back section of Hytbold in Eastern Rohan for the quest <i>Iserngraf: Severance</i>. TRAVEL ROUTE FROM BREE: South Bree to Snowbourne to Hytbold.
</li>
<li> Compendium 5 doesn't have a single quest you can get it from. You can either use marks at a skirmish camp to get it, trade 100 Fangorn leaves to Quickbeam in Derndingle for it, or pay 50 Amroth Silver Piece to the Dol Amroth Quartermaster.
</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: It's really not worth doing the Compendium 1 or 2 quests on a daily basis. 
</p><p>Compendium 1 involves farming worms in the Flaming Deeps of Moria that have an incredibly low spawn rate. I'd do this once in case there's some deed attached to finishing the quest, and then never go back to it. It's painful.
</p><p>Compendium 2 involves running a long twisting path killing stealthed Mirkwood spiders to reach a cave full of easier-to-farm spiders. I would only recommend doing it until you finish out the Mirkwood spider-slaying deed. The relics that come out of this quest are worth 384 shards so they're kind of worth your time, but only barely.
</p><p>Both the Galtrev and Hytbold quests are fast and easy to finish.
</p><p>As a rule of thumb, it takes me as much time to finish <i>Trace Metals</i> or <i>Silken Strands</i> as it does to finish both the Galtrev and Hytbold quests.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Skirmishes">Skirmishes</span></h2>
<p>Skirmishes are like little mini-raids or battles. You can either solo them, duo them with another player, or have a group up to a full raid party. In Skirmishes you get a sidekick NPC character called a skirmish soldier. You can either pick a skirmisher that has a different role than you (healing when you're DPS, DPS when you're healing, CC when you're either) or more of the same (you and Skirmisher both DPS, both tank, both heal). The latter option is more useful in group play.
</p><p>I've been using the Bannerguard as self-healing DPS, and the Herbalist for healing. Technically the Protector is the Tank but he doesn't hold aggro well and kills slowly. The Bannerguard also has some aggro issues but at least he kills fast.
</p><p>To change the race/sex of your skirmisher buy upgrades from the Cosmetics vendor in the Skirmish camp.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Rebuilding_Hytbold">Rebuilding Hytbold</span></h2>
<p>At level 84 you get the opportunity to rebuild Hybold in the Eastemnt of Rohan. Reaching level 84 generates a mail message that opens up the area quests.
</p><p>The rebuild of Hytbold is accomplished through a repetitive daily grind of quests. It unlocks armor and special area cosmetics, instances, and some other nice features. Because most of the nice "stuff" can be passed to alts once the entire area has been fully completed once on an account, you shouldn't feel the need to repeat the grind on other toons past unlocking the crafting materials instances for any crafting toons.
</p>
<ul>
<li> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.lotro.com/forums/showthread.php?482751-Hytbold-A-Guide-to-Rebuilding-and-Armour">Hytbold Forum Guide to Rebuilding and Armor</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose your five daily quests from sixteen quests randomly available each day. There are four quests each in the main settlements of the four areas: Snowbourn, Harwick, Cliving, and Eaworth.
</p><p>Completing a daily quest will also reward you with 1200 reputation for that area's faction.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Eaworth = Entwash Vale reputation
</li>
<li> Snowbourne = Sutcrofts reputation
</li>
<li> Harwick = Wold reputation
</li>
<li> Cliving = Norcrofts reputation
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because there are five daily quests and four quests per faction, you will always gain reputation with at least two factions per day if you do all quests.
</p><p>It requires "Ally" reputation and the rebuilt stables to use fast travel options between Hytbold and the various regional towns.
</p><p>To help with the reputation grind, you might want to check out the 'Curiosities' vendor at each of the skirmish camps. For 60 marks and 6 medallions they barter a Small Reputation Accelerator Tome. The tomes add 1,000 total rep on turn-in.
</p><p>Another option is to trade Tokens of Hytbold for reputation. You end up with significantly more tokens than you will likely want to spend on armor and home furnishings (the two main draws of Hytbold) and so burning tokens for reputation is a good way to speed up the otherwise slow grind.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Things_to_Farm.2FRepeat">Things to Farm/Repeat</span></h2>
<ul>
<li> You can only get 10 points in the Fishing hobby each day. It's a good idea to fish daily until you max it out. It's useful for festivals and Titles/Deeds. Some mid and high level quests are only available to those with the fishing hobby.
</li>
<li> You can get Bingo Badges from Bingo Baggins once a week (depending on your level). The badges can be traded for cosmetic pets, house decorations, and a nice mount.
</li>
<li> You can repeat the Intro quest to get a bundle of three Dyes. Colors include: Grey, Rust, Indigo, or Violet.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Mounts_and_Warsteeds">Mounts and Warsteeds</span></h2>
<p>This is one of my favorite elements of the game. I fully acknowledge it's a bit "silly" to collect fake horses in a MMO, but it's fun and fairly harmless.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mounts">Mounts</span></h3>
<p>More to Follow
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="War_Steeds">War Steeds</span></h3>
<p>"Medium" War steeds are available to all players (including Free to Play). Light and Medium War Steeds (as well as extra horse-based quests) are only available to players who bought the Riders of Rohan Expansion. For both types of players, the Helm's Deep expansion contains additional Mounted Combat content. Officially war steeds are available from level 75, but if you can survive the quests you can do them earlier. I earned Eachna's war steed at level 71 while still wearing (and carrying) mostly level 60-ish gear. 
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Builds_and_Traits">Builds and Traits</span></h4>
<p>There are three builds of war horses: "Light", "Medium", and "Heavy". These control the war steed's base stats.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Light war horses are the fastest and most agile, with the least hit points and power. They're meant for DPS builds.
</li>
<li> Medium war horses are balanced. Most of their stats are in the middle between light and heavy builds. They're meant for support builds.
</li>
<li> Heavy war horses are the slowest and least agile, with the most hit points and power. They're meant for tank builds.
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are three trait trees: "red", "yellow" and "blue". These correspond to the three trait trees each class can have.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Red has DPS skills.
</li>
<li> Yellow has support and crowd control skills.
</li>
<li> Blue has healing and tank skills.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The trait trees and builds are modular, so you could build a heavy war steed with DPS traits or a light war steed with support traits. Each build will have a slightly different selection of colored traits. This means that the DPS tree for heavy horses is different than the DPS tree for medium or light horses.
</p><p>The steeds are rather difficult to control for new players, so it's probably a good idea to start with a medium build and then switch to light or heavy once steering is no longer an issue.
</p><p>The two most important traits on the war steed are agility and power. I'd recommend new players put 3 points in Agility, then 3 points in Power, and only then start spending points in their colored trees.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="War_Steed_Legendary_Bridles">War Steed Legendary Bridles</span></h4>
<p>The War Steed bridles are simply another type of Legendary Item. They fit into one of your existing legendary item slots and can be examined and manipulated using the default SHIFT-i hot key combination.
</p><p>There are three types of bridles: "Light", "Medium", and "Heavy". They can be slotted on any build of horse, but the major legacies are assigned based on the named build. The minor legacies draw from the same pool for all builds.
</p><p>A "Light" bridle's major legacies will only come from the Light war steed's trait trees. This means that if you put a Light bridle on a Medium build horse, it will only benefit from the minor legacies.
</p><p>In order to avoid cluttering legendary item slots this means it's probably best to pick one build and stick with it for the long term. That means you only have to level 1-2 bridles at a time, leaving 4 free slots for the weapon and class item.
</p><p>I started with a Medium build on Eachna, but I switched to Light after experimenting with the speed and agility of the two builds. The Light steed runs faster and has better turning than the Medium steed. That means once I leave the Mounted Combat zones the Light build will be the most useful as a general mount.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="War_Steed_Cosmetics">War Steed Cosmetics</span></h4>
<p>War steed hides and manes/tails are a plain grey color on the basic steed. Make sure to equip the horse's solid grey body color, simple tail style, and plain saddle. It will look a little less homely this way. 
</p><p>The spotted leopard appaloosa hide color can drop from the Eastement warbands from the Riders of Rohan expansion. All other horse colors are sold in "packs" in the LOTRO store.
</p><p>Along with the horse colors, you can get visible accessories to further customize your mount. These include halters (bridles), saddles, caparisons (blankets), and leggings (leg straps/decorations). You can get several accessories for free, as well as buying others in the store. They can only be re-colored by purchasing color "packs" in the store. Scholar dyes do not work on war steed equipment.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Festival_Events">Festival Events</span></h2>
<p>There are several holiday events for LOTRO players.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Treasure_Hunt">Treasure Hunt</span></h3>
<p>I found this one kind of boring but I did get a nice mount on my first night playing it so I guess I shouldn't complain.
</p><p>It's a fairly simple premise. There's a special section of hills with buried treasure. Small sloth-like animals called Cave-Claws can identify promising holes, or you can just dig in any hole you see.
</p><p>You need Treasure Hunter's Pickaxes to dig. The rate of spawns are gated behind two free quests that give you axes and cave claws. The free quests are called "Berries" and "Treasure Hunt". You can repeat the two quests every 15 minutes, or buy pickaxes from the Turbine Store. It's really not worth it to buy the pickaxes from the store as they're 50 TP each.
</p><p>You want big holes (large or even huge) as they have the better loot drops in them. You need a Cave Claw or Dowsing Gem to tell you what size hole you have.
</p><p>If you have a long block of time to play, I suggest spending a couple hours doing the two free quests. Then, once you have a stash of pickaxes and cave claws, you can spend more focused time looking for big holes.
</p><p>You can also use a Dowsing Gem. Here is the table for Dowsing Gem messages:
</p>
<ul>
<li> You're getting a very weak reading - Small Dig-site
</li>
<li> You're getting a slight reading - Medium Dig-site
</li>
<li> You're getting a strong reading - Large Dig-site
</li>
<li> You're getting a very strong reading - Huge Dig-site
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Yule">Yule</span></h3>
<p>My first Yule turned out to be a frustrating grind. One of the most desirable cosmetic items from Yule is an outfit for a war steed. There's two each Yule, one that was new the previous year and one that is new the present year (and will show up again the following Yule). You have to repeat the assorted Yule quests to get a total of 120 completions to unlock the war steed cosmetics. 
</p>
<ul>
<li> The theater play is a lot of fun (although around day 6 or 7 it gets just as repetitive as anything else). You don't have to be there for the entire performance, just the end part that sends the "You attended a performance" message. You can actually enter when the curtain is closing and still get it. 
</li>
<li> To get credit for participating in the eating contest you only have to finish the first table, which is un-timed. 
</li>
<li> Once you've unlocked all the snowmen forms for the title and free house decorative snowman you only ever have to do the Broken Snowman (which only requires two parts to complete).
</li>
<li> You can 'cheer' the same Snowbeast three times. You don't have to run between all the snowbeasts cheering them.
</li>
<li> Don't start the snowball fight unless someone else is also ready to do it. If you're the only one there the quest fails.
</li>
<li> Try to run at least two toons through your first Yule and have one take the side of the Mayor and one take the side of the poor folks. This will get you two sets of cosmetic outfits.
</li>
<li> If you go for the 120 completions you will end up with more tokens than you'd expect. By focusing on 3 toons in Yule I unlocked both cosmetic mounts for each toon, a Grim for each, the two war steed outfits on each toon, the snowbeast cloak and boots, and still had over 50 tokens on each toon. I then ran a 4th toon to just get the assorted winter cosmetic outfits.
</li>
