<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Tips_For_SWGEmu_Noobs">Tips For SWGEmu Noobs</span></h1>
<p>There's very little point in an in-depth explanation of the history of the Star Wars Galaxies original game and then the rise of the emulator community. I played the game before the infamous NGE update, and I preferred it the old way, warts and all.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="My_Characters">My Characters</span></h2>
<p>I play on the Basilisk server and I'm a member of the SWG-U City &amp; Guild. This is a teaching group led by Mobyus Mune.
</p><p>For now, the assorted emulator servers allow you to have many characters, which somewhat breaks the economy (everyone can have one or two PVP mains with a full line of support toons), On the Basilisk server I think the character limit is 10. In the future, it's likely we'll be allowed something like two or three characters at most. I'm trying to plan for that day by only playing two characters and seeing if I can scratch all my sandbox itches within those limits.
</p><p>If I make one a Bio-Engineer/Tailor and one a Doctor/Medic, I believe I can use both for harvesting and both for a money-making role.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ssudia_Chok.27toth">Ssudia Chok'toth</span></h3>
<p>Ssudia is a Zabrak training as a combat medic and doctor, with one level of either surveying or scouting for resource gathering.
</p><p>She can be both a master Combat Medic and a Master Doctor. This leaves her with 18 build points.
</p><p>She could take a full line of ranged damage (most likely Pistols).
</p><p>She could take the Scout Profession with one box of Hunting.
</p><p>Since Eachna will have both Scout and Artisan training, I'll probably give Ssudia the Pistol line so she has a little defense. I think if she's being attacked something will probably be up close and in her face, meaning pistols are the best choice.
</p><p>Grinding plan for now:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Master Medic. DONE.
</li>
<li> Master Marksman.
</li>
<li> Master Doctor
</li>
<li> Master Combat Medic.
</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes time to take Master Combat Medic, give back points from Marksman.
</p><p>When Suncrusher goes live, I'll probably rename her to plain Ssudia.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Eachna_daltaOengusa">Eachna daltaOengusa</span></h3>
<p>Eachna is a human training as a craftsperson. I haven't yet chosen a speciality for her, but I'm leaning towards Tailoring, perhaps with a bit of Bio-Engineer to create my own tissue samples for clothes.
</p><p>With both Master Tailor and Master Bio-Engineer she has an additional 37 build points. This is quite generous and allows her much more flexibility than Ssudia.
</p><p>She can take the full Surveying line in Artisan and still have 23 points.
</p><p>Grinding plan for now:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Novice Tailor + Surveying. DONE.
</li>
<li> Master Medic.
</li>
<li> Medic. Give back all but Organic Chemistry line.
</li>
<li> Scout Hunting line.
</li>
<li> Master Tailor.
</li>
<li> Master Bio-Engineer.
</li>
</ul>

</p>
<ul>
<li> Alt - to switch out of reticule mode.

</li>

</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Shorthand_in_Chat">Shorthand in Chat</span></h3>
<p>If you want player training, you can ask in chat. An example of this:
</p><p>"LFT &lt;Tree&gt; xxxx"
</p>
<ul>
<li> LFT means "Looking for Trainer" or "Looking for Training"
</li>
<li> &lt;Tree&gt; is the tree you want training in. Medic, Artisan, Doctor, etc.
</li>
<li> xxxx is where you show which box you need training.
</li>
</ul>
<p>"LFT Medic 1xxx" means you want training in the leftmost, lowest row box in the medic tree (in this case, First Aid I).
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Survey_Missions_for_Credits">Survey Missions for Credits</span></h2>
<p>This is a grind-ey but low or no danger way of earning credits. It's a useful way to accumulate enough credits to be able to afford enough gear to get better paying combat missions.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Setups">Setups</span></h3>
<p>Tattooine: Mos Eisley Starport (Artisan terminal just outside the starport across the "street" and inside a little courtyard) and Anchorhead
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Method">Method</span></h3>
<p>The way this works: find two cities with starports/shuttleports and at least 1024 kilometers apart (if all else fails try the setups). You will have "City A" and "City B". Survey for a mineral or chemical with a concentration of at least 75-80% near the appropriate artisan terminal in City A. Fly to City B. Survey for a mineral or chemical with a concentration of at least 75-80% near the appropriate artisan terminal in City B.
</p><p>While still in City B, accept 2 Artisan survey missions for the material you found in city A. Fly back to city A. Collect credits for approaching the waypoint. 
</p><p>While in City A, accept 2 Artisan survey missions for the material you found in city B. Fly back to City B. Collect credits for approaching the waypoint. 
</p><p>Repeat until you feel you have enough credits.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Medic.2FDoctor.2FCombat_Medic_Help">Medic/Doctor/Combat Medic Help</span></h2>
<p>A Medic is a starter profession. Some people put points into Medic so they can use "B" grade healing packs while out doing missions. If you plan on specializing in healing, you go through Medic on the way to Doctor or Combat Medic.
</p><p>A Doctor can heal toons in very close proximity and has the ability to resurrect dead toons without needing to return to the cloning center. Doctors have the best Heath and Action buffs in the game. 
</p><p>A Combat Medic can heal toons at range. Combat Medics have a special form of damage that allows them to poison mobs or toons. Since Combat Medics can't raise dead toons, it's _highly_ advised they splash enough Doctor to get that ability.
</p><p><i>In general</i>, Doctors tend to set up in medical centers to buff mission runners and fix black wound damage. <i>In general</i>, Combat Medics tend to join groups to heal on missions. <i>In general</i>, Medics are still training or just a splash tree for self-healing.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Basics_of_Healing">The Basics of Healing</span></h3>
<p>The player bar is made up of Health, Action, and Mind stats (Your "HAM" bar). Medics can attend to Health and Action. Only Entertainers can attend to Mind.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Health is red.
</li>
<li> Action is green.
</li>
<li> Mind is blue.
</li>
</ul>
<p>To see what damage a player has, target them and use "/diagnose".
</p><p>To heal Health and Action, you should craft up (or buy) some stimpacks. I can't stress highly enough that since you have to grind crafting experience, you might as well make your own packs.
</p>
<ul>
<li> To fix white bar Health or Action damage, use the command "/healDamage". You need Stimpacks in your inventory for white healing.
</li>
<li> To fix black bar Health or Action wounds, use the command "/healWound". You need Health or Action Wound Medpacks in your inventory for black healing.
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Assorted_Hints_and_Tips">Assorted Hints and Tips</span></h3>
<ul>
<li> Make your own starter stimpacks. If you need to grind medical crafting xp, make Biological Effect Controllers on practice mode. This is the best return on materials used for xp gained. For Doctor/CM, make Advanced Biological Effect Controllers. Make Small Stimpack A's and Action/Health Wound Medpacks to carry around and apply to damage as needed.
</li>
<li> If you're just starting out (or otherwise poor), go to a Cantina and heal the dancers. Use /healdamage to heal the dancers (have crafted stimpacks available in inventory). Occasionally (I macro it every other heal), I use /tenddamage to cause mind damage and battle fatigue. The performers can heal this and will get xp from it. To be clear, /healdamage is for your benefit. /tenddamage is payback for leeching xp from the performers. If you can, tipping them is also in order.
</li>
<li> Another place to find damaged people is in the Cloning Centers on each planet. Be prepared to fix black wound damage. 
</li>
<li> To be a full-featured attendant out in the field, you want points in Combat Medic, Doctor (at least to resurrection), Entertainer and enough Scout to set up a camp.
</li>
<li> Sell Stimpack-B's on the bazaar for other people who can heal themselves to make some cash.
</li>
<li> You want high Overall Quality and Potential Energy, as well as Unit Toughness for basic med packs.

</li>
</ul>
<p>As soon as you can survey, you should start planet hopping and collecting the advanced resources you will need later in your career. It should be possible to get everything (except Meat and Bones) without combat.
</p><p><b>Supplies In Your Medical Bag</b>
</p><p>Here are a list of things to have on hand to be a Medic.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Small Stimpack A. To heal dancers and minor white damage while killing small mobs.
</li>
<li> Action Wound Medpack A. To heal very minor black damage while in the medical center.
</li>
<li> Health Wound Medpack A. To heal very minor black damage while in the medical center.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The two Wound Medpack A's are great to heal wound damage after sampling for Radioactives.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Medic_Training">Medic Training</span></h3>
<ul>
<li> Healing entertainers in the Cantina is the best low-level way of gaining experience.
</li>
<li> When you get to higher tiers, there are usually performers who burn large amounts of Action damage available in large medical centers.
</li>
<li> A good way to get wound experience: Sample for Radioactives (good for Combat Medic crafting) and heal your own wounds. Bonus points: When you visit the Cantina, some lucky entertainer(s) will get experience from healing your Mind wounds.
</li>
</ul>
<p>When spending experience in the boxes, take First Aid I, then Diagnostics I, and go up the two lines alternating. When both lines are done, go back and get Pharmacology. At the same time, make sure to grind crafting for Organic Chemistry I-IV.
</p><p>I found practicing on four crafting devices in the Cantina while macro healing dancers was the most efficient usage of my time. If I got low on healing Stims, I could /dump my macros, craft a few Stims, and then go back to the macro'd healing and crafting.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Doctor_Training">Doctor Training</span></h3>
<p>Doctor training is pretty straightforward.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Master Medic 
</li>
<li> Master Doctor
</li>
</ul>
<p>A Master Doctor costs 110 of the 250 build points. Doctors can easily afford Entertainer skills. They have enough points for either Master Musician or Master Dancer.
</p><p>Otherwise, they could take some amount of Scout and Artisan skills to allow themselves to harvest some or all of their own materials. Another popular choice is one weapon line.
</p><p>When spending experience in the boxes, take Wound Treatment Speed I, then Wound Treatment I, and go up the two lines alternating. When both lines are done, go back and get Doctor Medicine Knowledge.
</p><p>At the same time, make sure to grind crafting for Medicine Crafting I-IV.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Combat_Medic_Training">Combat Medic Training</span></h3>
<p>Combat Medics are a hybrid profession. That is, they require skills from both the Marksman tree as well as the Medic tree.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Novice Combat medic requires the full line of Ranged Support from Marksman.
</li>
<li> Novice Combat medic requires Novice Medic.
</li>
<li> Master Combat medic requires the full Combat Medic tree.
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Doctor_Crafting">Doctor Crafting</span></h3>
<p>What resources does a Doctor Require? (Borrowed from the Doctor FAQ)
</p>
<ul>
<li> Lokian Wild Wheat - This is used to make advanced biological effect controllers which are, in turn, used to make nearly everything a doctor can make. Docs need tons of this and the wildlife of Lok is quite dangerous.
</li>
<li> Tatooinian Fiberplast - Use with the Lokian Wild Wheat. Need tons of this, but it's not as risky to get.
</li>
<li> Dantooine Berry Fruit - Used for stimpacks, enhancement packs, and resuscitation kits
</li>
<li> Talusian Water Vapor - Same as Dantooine Berry Fruit
</li>
<li> Herbivore and Avian Meat - As most doctors aren't great fighters, this is something that they almost always need.
</li>
<li> Class 4 Liquid Petrochem Fuel - Don't get this mixed up with any of the others, it must be Class 4.
</li>
<li> Dolovite Iron - Usually not as high in demand, but this is used to make medpacks and enhancement packs.
</li>
<li> Domesticated Oats - Goes along with the Dolovite Iron
</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically for Buffs you need:
</p>
<ul>
<li> two chemical types (class IV liquid petro, Tattooine fiberplast)
</li>
<li> two floral types (Lokian wild wheat, domesticated oats)
</li>
<li> one mineral type (dolovite iron)
</li>
<li> one gas type (reactive gas)
</li>
<li> two (unharvestable) meat types (avian, herbivore)
</li>
</ul>
<p>Doctors are highly advised to take Artisan and fill in the Surveying tree to overnight Sample or put down Harvesters (or both), especially during the long climb up to Master Doctor while they're still building their reputation and credit balance. 
</p><p>If you don't have Scout skills you'll want to build a relationship with Hunters. You'll need them to harvest your Herbivore and Avian meat. Be willing to buy junk meat as well as the good quality stuff. It keeps them coming back to you, and can still be used in lower-tier products or improved with one or two very high quality additives.
</p><p>I haven't seen any issues with harvesting plants as far as supply goes. Each time I've landed on Lok, I was able to find "Wild Wheat" (and so on for the other plants). I may have simply been lucky, but it appears most to all of the plants spawn in each cycle.
</p><p>Class 4 Liquid Petrochem Fuel may or may not be available in a particular spawn cycle, and Dolovite Iron may or may not be available.
</p><p>What can easily be an issue with all of these is the quality of the materials. Thanks to the magic of the Random Number Generator and how everything interacts, even lackluster-looking materials can be made into quite decent final products, unfortunately if you have one or two very bad materials it can bring down the quality of otherwise excellent components. The best solution is to have a good variety of base materials to pick and choose between.
</p><p>You should be looking for resources with 800 (or greater) Overall Quality and Potential Energy. If the component has Potential Energy as a stat prioritize it over Overall Quality. If the item doesn't need potential energy, just look at the overall quality. 
</p><p>If you harvest or overnight sample for one material each day starting when you're a medic, and don't simply speed-grind your experience, you'll have a small stock with which to start making average-quality medpacks and buffs once you hit Doctor.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Combat_Medic_Crafting">Combat Medic Crafting</span></h3>
<p>What resources does a Combat Medic Require? (Borrowed from the Combat Medic FAQ)
</p>
<ul>
<li> Titanium Aluminum, Eleton Reactive Gas(required for Advanced Injection Amplifiers)
</li>
<li> Class 2 Liquid Petrochem and Yavinian Fiberplast(required for Advanced Dispersal Mechanisms)
</li>
<li> Tolium Reactive Gas and Class 1 Radioactive(required for Advanced Resilience Compounds)
</li>
<li> Fungi, Radioactive, Insect Meat and Non-Ferrous Metal.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything noted for Doctors and gathering resources applies to Combat Medics.
</p><p>Sample for the raw materials you can find. Be aware that some materials may not spawn every cycle (like Class 2 Liquid Petrochem and Class 1 Radioactive). Have a Scout alt or build a relationship with hunters to get quality Insect meat. Buy junk insect meat as well, in order to maintain your relationships as well as to simply have a selection of base ingredients on hand.
</p><p>Get familiar with the class of raw materials, and which specific materials fit within the broader categories. For exmaple, Titanium Aluminum is a Non-Ferrous Metal. Whenever possible, grab Titanium Aluminum. But, always keep a little stash of one of the other Non-Ferrous Metals (like one or two of the Coppers) in case Titanium Aluminum remains elusive or goes through a long streak of nearly useless quality.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Tailoring">Tailoring</span></h2>
<p>Tailoring is one of the few skills where the quality of the raw materials does not affect the final product. However, it requires a keen fashion sense, including a good understanding of color and texture.
</p>
<ul>
<li> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.infamousbrad.com/swg/backup.html">Brad Bradley SWG Tailor</a>. This is a good guide to the color palettes and some basic tailoring information.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because there are no issues with the quality scores of materials, Tailors have a much easier time getting many of the raw materials they need for clothing and jewelery. However, even Tailors have some rare materials that can be difficult to acquire.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tailoring_Crafting_Grind">Tailoring Crafting Grind</span></h3>
<p>To get to Master Artisan, you can grind out either Barrels, or Couplers, or a Muzzles. Opinions vary, and Muzzles tend to be the most recommended, but I didn't see any real difference between any of them.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rare_Tailoring_Materials">Rare Tailoring Materials</span></h3>
<ul>
<li> Tatooinian Wooly Hide - required for High Quality Boots
</li>
<li> Nabooian Scaley Hide - required for Thermal Boots
</li>
<li> Thoranium Steel - required for Bounty Hunter Packs
</li>
<li> Titanium Aluminum - required for Spec-Ops Packs
</li>
<li> Green Diamond Crystalline Gemstone - required for Twi'lek Noble's Crest
</li>
<li> Plexite Armophous Gemstone - required for Twi'lek Noble's Crest
</li>
</ul>
<p>The two gemstones tend to be very rare spawns. There are 10 different Armophous gemstones in the game, of which Plexite is one. Most of the time, there are two Armophous gemstones in spawn in every galaxy, but sometimes only one. Each spawn lasts an average of 10 days. So odds are Plexite will spawn every 50-60 days.
</p><p>There are only 8 Crystal Gemstones on the same spawn rate (one to two types spawning every 10 days), so Green Diamond will spawn more often then Plexite.
</p><p>There are similar issues with the Thoranium Steel and Titanium Aluminum. The day you decide you want to take up tailoring, sta surveying for these four materials. A single extractor run (or a single overnight sampling pull) can bring in enough rare materials to keep you going until you catch up with the spawn pattern.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Resource_Gathering">Resource Gathering</span></h2>
<ul>
<li> Hand Sampling is roughly equivalent to the very best quality extractor.
</li>
<li> 50% Pet Buff: There's a skill called "Resource Scavenger". It is a collection reward. It requires 1 skill point in beastmaster and any quality pet. You simply have your pet out while hand sampling and every now and then when you get the "high concetration" popup there will be a third option to have your pet gather the reources. Do this twenty times and you get the ability to teach all your pets this skill. Then simply loop a macro to keep the buff going (lasts 15 minutes normally) and you get the 50% bonus.
</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Macros">Macros</span></h2>
<p>Macros are linked scripts of commands that allow you to automate certain actions for your character(s). This game has a lot of activities that are better handled by macros than manually typed. The first time you want to sample for resources you'll learn exactly what I mean.
</p><p>Each line in a macro should end in a semi-colon ";".
</p><p>In order to keep from triggering AFK status, you can add a line that says "/mood none;" in your macro. This doesn't cause any in-game spam.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="General_Macro_Info">General Macro Info</span></h3>
<ul>
<li> "/dump" stops your macros and clears the queue.
</li>
<li> Every line in your macro file ends in a semi-colon ";"
</li>
<li> Remember that the computer counts starting at 0.
</li>
<li> This bears repeating. Remember that every count starts at 0. 
</li>
<li> "/ui action targetGroup0" To target group members, group member 1 is targetGroup0. For the last time, every count starts at 0.
</li>
<li> "/ui action toolbarSlot 00" To target toolbar slots. Count from left to right and top row before the bottom row. The top row is 0-11. The bottom row is 12-23.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The game is rather notorious for de-syncing connections between the client and server. This appears to be poor coding on Sony's part (it occurred exactly the same way when SWG was a live game) and therefore probably can't be fixed by the emulator team.
</p><p>One way to deal with this is to "softlog" (hit the Disconnect button and then log back in) once an hour or so. If you're in a busy place like an active medical center or a cantina, increase that to once every half hour.
</p><p>For the softlog command to work, sort your character list so the character you plan to be playing will be first at the top of the list.
</p><p>Softlogin Macro
</p>
<pre>
/ui action gameMenuActivate;
/pause1;
/ui action defaultButton;

<p>AutoHeal
</p>
<pre>

</pre>
<p>SlowHeal
</p>
<pre>
/healDamage;
/pause 30;
/tendDamage;
/pause 30;
/macro SlowHeal;
</pre>
<p>I have a separate SlowHeal macro because new entertainers don't always burn Action as fast as I need to maximize my experience gain. If an "ent" is flourishing a lot I want to stay on them (so they get the Mind heal experience), and the SlowHeal forces me to pace myself to their rate.
</p><p>CantinaHeal
</p>
<pre>
/target NAME1;
/pause .5;
/tendDamage;
/pause 15;
/healDamage;
/pause 15;
/target NAME2;
/pause .5;
/tendDamage;
/pause 15;
/healDamage;
/pause 15;
/macro CantinaHeal
</pre>
<p>For CantinaHeal, stand between two Ents who are burning Action. Adjust NAME1 and NAME2 to be their names. Be prepared to craft stims as you go. The .5 second pauses between targeting and tending are to allow the game to account for any latency.
</p><p>This macro is useful because once you finish Medic (or even just get near the top of the tree) Medics can heal faster than ents will burn action. By splitting your heals between two ents you get the same amount of healing in while only needing each of them to burn half the Action points. It's a great way to keep your healing going while you're practice (or real) medical crafting.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Resource_Gathering_Macros">Resource Gathering Macros</span></h3>
<p>Autosample
</p>
<pre>
/mood none;
/sample;
/pause 3;
/stand;
/kneel;
/pause 14;
/macro AutoSample;
</pre>
<p>As per the original author: It takes care of the drifting problem and the pop-up messages. Since there is no delay between /stand and /kneel, my toon does not have enough time to actually move, but it still stops the sampling. At full expertise, I need the 14 seconds to completely recover my Action, then I can start sampling again. Since sampling is stopped and then restarted, the pop-ups do not disturb me.
</p><p>Note: To start, try a 21-second pause.
</p><p>Autosample Two Different Resources
</p>
<pre>
/ui action toolbarSlot00; &lt;&lt;This will select the F-Key you have the Survey Device assigned to.
/pause 5; &lt;&lt; Time to tell the Survey Device what you want to sample.
/ui action toolbarSlot00; &lt;&lt; Closes the Survey window
/sample;
/pause 300; &lt;&lt; # of seconds you want to survey
/mood none;
/stand;
/pause 300; &lt;&lt; # of seconds you want to Heal
/mood none;
/ui action toolbarSlot01; &lt;&lt; This will select the F-Key you have the 2nd Survey Device assigned to.
/pause 5; &lt;&lt; Time to tell the Survey Device what you want to sample.
/sample;
/pause 300; &lt;&lt; # of seconds you want to survey
/mood none;
/stand;
/pause 300; &lt;&lt; # of seconds you want to Heal
/mood none;
/macro MultiSample; &lt;&lt; Loops Macro
</pre>
<p>As per the original author: So put a Survey Device, like a Mineral Survey Device, in 00 or F-1. Put a second Survey Device, like a Chemical Survey Device in 01 or F-2. Now Place your Macro you just created in 02 or F-3. Find an area with good concentrations of two different resources. Now Sit back and watch your Resources add up.
</p><p>Note: This will not work AFK as you have to manually choose each item to survey each time you swap. This is a good activity while you're grinding practice xp.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Crafting_Grind_Macros">Crafting Grind Macros</span></h3>
<p>This is an example of how to chain two complicated macros together to get a longer macro.
</p><p>The schematic number for Advanced Biological Effects Controllers is different for each player. Go to your datapad (Ctrl-D) choose draft schematics, then find what item you want to create (use the default view). Once you find it, you need to then start at the top left schematic and begin counting (starting with 0). These items are in rows of 4, so the first row is numbers 0, 1, 2, 3. Keep counting until you get to the item you want. Check in the macro and increment/decrement as needed.
</p><p>The pauses in CraftABEC are timed based on the pauses in ABEC-1 and ABEC-2, plus 2-4 seconds.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fishing">Fishing</span></h3>
<p>Try to have a 76% quality or better pole. According to fishing experts, there's very little to no difference between a 76% pole and a 100% pole. Make sure to forage for bait (Survival 1 skill), or buy a jar of starter bait. When you fillet a fish you get more bait.
</p><p>The best fishing spots have high Fish Density and low Vegetation ratings.
