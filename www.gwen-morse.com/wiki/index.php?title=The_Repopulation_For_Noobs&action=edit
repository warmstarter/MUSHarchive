== My Character ==

I'm presently playing on the Hudson West test server as Ssudia Choktoth. I have reserved this name as part of my alpha testing backer rewards.

My goal is to use Ssudia to gather resources and be a combat medic.

She's started in Freedomtown as a member of the FPR (Free People's Republic).

=== Post Launch Notes ===

* Light Armor
* Dual Wield Pistols
* Medical Scanner + shield
* put spare Armor SI into shields
* put spare Weapon SI into unarmed combat
* GE Pets
* Cooking
* Roll own bandages
* Fishing
* All trade skill SI go to Horticulture
* Leadership

The hairstyle I like is Long 6.

== I Finished The Tutorial Now What? ==

=== Sandbox ===

If you've never played in a sandbox game, you'll step out of the tutorial and be very lost. Why? Because...there's a lot to do and yet somehow, "nothing" to do. You'll be standing in the middle of a strange town with mysterious mail messages arriving describing missions for unknown NPCs to places you have no idea how to find, and your starting city may be mostly or entirely empty. If it's not empty, the only connected players may be standing in a loose circle around the crafting machines like little MMO zombies. It's okay, they're crafting, you'll learn to recognize the glazed look in their pixilated eyes.

Welcome to the world of sandbox games. A sandbox game is one that doesn't have fixed rules on how to advance. ''The Repopulation is only kinda-sorta a sandbox game, but there are certainly enough elements available even in alpha that I thought it could use an explanation''. You can do what you want. That includes (but is not limited to): 

* Standing around public places lavishing total strangers with buffs and practising slightly silly-looking dance moves.
* Roaming the countryside trying to strip it of wildlife or harvest-able raw materials.
* Join the Zombie Crafter movement. 
* Exploring the vast map trying to collect every "I visited X and all I got was this lousy teeshirt" achievement.
* Collect the other achievements that have nothing to do with landmarks.
* Mission. Mission again. Mission some more. Mission harder. Uncle Sam wants YOU to mission! Start to hate the missions. Learn to love them when there's a patch and suddenly...OOOH! MORE MISSIONS!
* Try out some minigames. Some of the more interesting ones include Diplomacy, Hacking, and Fishing.
* Meet other players playing the game. Practice winning friends and influencing people.

=== Alpha ===

Even people used to sandbox style games can get a little lost when they fire up the Repopulation. Why? Because, it's in alpha and the community is pretty small.

Alpha means "stuff isn't finished". Yeah...we all know that, but it doesn't necessarily sink in until you start playing.

* It very quickly starts to feel like there's about four different missions options and they're being spammed at you every 2.1 seconds.
* Mission lines may end abruptly.
* Weapons and armor aren't yet balanced.
* Some things feel "too easy" to craft, a lot more feel "too hard".
* Loot drops will imply some interesting, mysterious purpose and then do nothing.
* The Auction House doesn't appear to have any listings for anything you might possibly want. It often feels like it's nothing but crafting materials, and even then nothing that you'd want.

Just assume nothing works and everything is broken. It's easier that way :D. Both "nothing" and "everything" are hyperbole in this case. Some things do work and some things aren't broken. Half the fun of Alpha testing is figuring out which things do work and what things aren't broken.

=== Alpha Sandbox ===

Now that we understand that nothing works and everything is broken, and you have to make your own fun because there are no rules, it's time to begin. 

If you're asking "What do I do now", it just means you don't have a *goal*. I'll give you four just to get you started.

# Try out combat.
# Do some missions.
# Try crafting a cloned pet.
# Get a (better) bike.

Note: My old advice "Get a bike" no longer applies. You can get a bike in the tutorial area. instead, the advice is now "get a better bike".

These are all "PvE" (player versus environment) activities. That's because PvP (player versus player) is an empty hollow shell of an activity in alpha.

If you didn't skip the tutorial, you should have at least two weapons, a pistol and a rifle. You may have picked up others from the nice trainers. Take whichever weapons you have and step just outside the gates of your starter town (Either Plymouth or Freedomtown). Keep one eye on your radar and wander around a bit. Eventually you'll see some red markers pop up. Head towards them and open fire (or start swinging). If you die, run back from the Cloning Center and do it again. If they die, loot their tasty corpse for raw materials. You will die. A lot. That's normal. You're an immortal clone in The Repopulation. Death is only a loading screen.

After you get bored of slaughtering semi-helpless wild animals and riffling their pockets for meat slabs and DNA samples, you can try out some missions. Click on the envelope icon and accept the first three missions that come into your mailbox. Give them the old college try. If you spend more than fifteen minutes wandering helplessly, abandon that mission and take a new one later. You'll be swarmed by missions, like a tasty blood doner near a mosquito pond, so you don't need to waste a lot of time trying to complete each mission.

Take some of your profits from doing missions and buy some Sterilizing Agents from the medical supplier in the cloning center. If you can't find the cloning center, don't worry. Just run back outside and let the wild animals have their revenge. Death is just another way to fast travel! Also pick up the book "Basic Genetic Engineering". Skip down to my section on [http://www.gwen-morse.com/wiki/index.php/The_Repopulation_For_Noobs#The_Basic_Quick_and_Dirty_Method Quick and Dirty Pet Cloning]. When you're done cloning a small stack of pets, give killing mobs outside town another try. See how much easier it is with a faithful attack clone?

Finally, sell all the random junk you've accumulated to a vendor. Harvest stuff, do missions, and repeat until you have enough to buy an upgraded bike or cycle in the Auction House. Your tutorial bike is fine to start, but it's slow and doesn't handle very well, so an update should be early on your list of "Things to buy". With transportation, you can explore the whole map. Try to follow the roads and speed past whatever mobs you see. Just wander around a bit and enjoy the landscape. Don't worry if you die, death is still just a loading screen. Find some of the little satellite towns and camps that belong to your faction. Harvest all the crazy materials you'll start to find. Learn to evade mobs, to use your pet clones (if you have any), to recognize what you can and can't beat up.

While you're doing all this, try to make friends in chat. Eventually you'll figure out which solo activities you enjoy and you'll find people to team up with for group activities.

=== What is a Fitting and What is a Shell? ===

You finished character generation and you picked the armor that you thought was least ugly, or made your female toon's breasts look the biggest. Then there was something in the tutorial about a fitting and you put a little widget inside a box with five slots and then you were lost.

A shell is a very generic item that has slots to hold specialized gear upgrades called fittings. The shell is the outside "cosmetic" part of an item, and it usually has some very crude stats attached to it. Weapons, armor, transportation, and similar items are all "shells". You pretty much choose the shells you want based on aesthetics, as the stats are so minor as to not matter. Shells are meant to be indestructible.

Each shell has fitting slots (usually five). Fittings are the upgrades you put into your shells. These are very specific and are keyed to both a physical geometric shape (called a "socket") and a purpose. You can't stick a fitting meant to improve your shield blocking technique in a pair of boots. Fittings take a little damage each time you die, and weapon fittings take damage on use. They're meant to be regularly replaced.

A raw noob doesn't actually need fittings (which is good because they're kind of expensive and you'll have no idea which specific ones to buy). The weak stats you get in your starting weapon and armor shells are enough to (kinda) keep you alive while you (sorta) kill mobs.

Very crude fittings drop as random loot. I suggest collecting them and using them in your gear to help give you a sense how they can be useful. If you do this, by the time you "need" fittings you should be experienced enough in the game to understand why you want them and how to use them.

=== Skills and Abilities ===

The game has a huge skill tree. Most of the skills relate to crafting, but there are trees for weapon use, armor use, defense, cooking, entertaining, being a dirty bastard (criminal activities), animal handling, and other fun activities.

The skill system is "skill on use". This means each time you click on something (attack a mob, push a crafting button, pick a lock) you have a chance of getting a little bit of experience.

Skill use is usually connected with clicking on "stuff" in the game environment, or by interacting with a mini-game.

Abilities are the special powers you get from using your skills. Abilities go in your hotbars and are usually activated by clicking on their specific icon.

Clubbing something in the head with your medical scanner is a Skill use. Clicking on the "Medical Scan" icon to restore hit points is an Ability use. You get abilities as mission rewards, special turn-in rewards, occasional loot drops, or by buying them using "Repop points". If you find you're not being offered Abilities when you hand in missions, it's probably time to run around and gain some more points in your skills. You only get offered higher tiers of Abilities by earning higher tiers of Skills.

Armor and Shield skilling is done by being hit while wearing a particular type of armor, or wielding a shield.

== The Repopulation's Crafting System ==

Much has been said about The Repopulation's crafting system. It's "like Star War Galaxy's crafting system" only with more tiers, "it's deep and immersive", and so on. 

=== Crafting: The Good ===

The crafting system is complex, but can be learned very quickly. It really REALLY helps to have outside references. I would be lost without the [http://aena.at/craftmap/ Crafting Map] site. Once you have the references that work for you, learning recipes goes quickly.

If you don't care about the quality of the item you want to make, you can make all the parts yourself. You just have to invest in a lot of recipe books, and tramp all over the map looking for harvest points. Doing things this way will result in junk items, but at least they're "your" junk. This means it's technically possible to make all the components of an item.

If you have friends, the system is designed so they can help you power level quickly. If you and a small group of people all decide you want to create gun fittings, you can break the components up amongst each other. You could divide the work a few different ways and still all be able to gather resources, and all be able to make parts. If you bring in a new friend later on, you can give them grinding materials to skill up quickly and be able to fit into the manufacturing process.

If you want to harvest raw materials resources, you can easily specialize in that activity. If you want to make particular components, you can specialize there. The system is designed for specialization and so you don't have to worry about controlling your entire vertical supply chain.

=== Crafting: The Bad ===

I'm a firm believer in elegance in system design, and I feel the devs of the game have made crafting complicated solely for the purpose of claiming it's complicated. which is an in-elegant design choice. Complexity for complexity's sake is something I consider lazy work. 

That's right, I just called the overworked, underpaid devs in an indie game studio "lazy". It is _very_ "easy" to get a group of people together and design a system that slams you in the face with its complexity. It's much harder to design a system that looks simple on the surface and is complex once you dig into it. Another way to describe the situation is to say the system lacks depth. When you jump into deep crafting system in you find it comfortable and immersive. You don't feel like you have to fight with a deep crafting system to create items, instead the interface and recipes are designed to be comfortable and possibly even a feel a little rewarding. Repoulation's crafting system has none of these deep, elegant design choices.

There's a meme that goes "It's so dense, every single image has so many things going on." This is a quote from Rick McCallum, a producer for the Star Wars prequels and the new remastered Special Editions of the original trilogy. He was trying to make all the CGI Lucas inserted into these movies sound like a positive thing. I feel sorry for him, he had a tough job. I'm also pretty sure it sounded better in his head then how it came out.

This crafting system reminds me of that meme. A lot of little pieces trying to justify themselves, instead of elegant system design.

Steps are being taken to resolve some of these issues, and so I do hope to see real fixes in place before launch.

=== Crafting: The Ugly === 

The Repopulation crafting system is designed so there's almost nothing a new character can make that is "useful" to them. However they are taking steps to improve this by inserting specific simplified crafting recipes that will allow people to try out a particular tree, or make some basic items for themselves, on the route to more complex crafting interdependency.

The system is still ugly because it forces new players to be useless. New crafters are stuck making a lot of cruft materials. They can't process anything worth selling while their skills are low. They can't even be sharecroppers for someone else. Raw materials should be top quality in order for the end products to also be top quality. New players are too weak to get to top quality raw materials in the wild. If they do manage to stumble across any high quality raw materials, they immediately becomes useless grinding material upon any sort of processing, because weak noob skills transform it into trash. Skilled older players are given multiple stages where they can make trash materials into high quality materials. This is good to keep high quality materials in the supply chain. It's bad for people who lack the skill to harvest or create high quality goods.

This floods the market with high quality goods from established players, which then crushes the low quality goods and resources new players are locked into producing. New players become mendicants. They either "beg" established players and nations to adopt them, or they have to do everything for themselves and wander around missioning to come up with enough cash to support themselves through the long crafting grind. It makes for a harsh, ugly world when new players being power-levelled by older player people is the right way to play.

I'm sticking with the game so far but I admit to being highly disappointed by the crafting.

=== Crafting: Forced Interdependence ===

The devs want the crafting community to be interdependent on each other. They want all the stages of item construction to be shared out between multiple players. They want players buying and selling and bartering and wheeling/dealing in back rooms to set up the larger world manufacturing chain.

Instead of designing a system that's clean and simple at the lowest tiers and gradually growing into more complex items as you increase in skills, the system was designed from the very start to require a lot of very specific and unconnected parts to create objects.

No tree is self-contained. By that I mean you can't make any items by only using skills in that tree. Nearly all ingredients need very specific items.

Most recipes don't just require a generic chemical "base". Instead, a recipe will usually want the Sodium Bicarbonate base, and Sodium Bicarbonate only comes from one source, a specific fish. Another part of the recipe might require Potassium Bioxolate, which only ones from one plant. Yet another ingredient in the recipe may require glue, which can only be made from the sap of one tree.

Things like glue and Potassium Bioxolate are themselves used as specific ingredients in many recipes, which makes it hard to source a steady supply. Products are either generic enough that they're oversupplied and considered trash, or so valuable that people fight tooth and nail for every scrap of the material that comes into the market.

A clever society that needed as much glue as cycles through the Repop crafting system would figure out how to make glue from multiple sources. Sadly, the NPCs in game aren't smart enough to figure this out. I suppose it comes from refusing to support inventors or experimental scientists.

The planet is rich in ores, plants and trees, and it has a varied animal ecosystem (if you overlook the extreme dominance of predators over prey animals). Sadly, the early scientists who settled and developed the manufacturing systems now used in-game were so short-sighted they only found one or two uses for each material in the world.

=== Crafting Update (1 Month) ===

After my first steady month of play, the crafting has become slightly less miserable. This is because I've started to pick up a few small recipes that are easy to complete.

* Hudson Cloth isn't horrible once you find a source of Hudson Fir and/or Hok Weed. This means making bandages from looted Spherefish and Hudson Cloth becomes do-able by one person (and much MUCH easier than polyester filaments). Hudson Fir is found with Takayura Wood on the way from Freedomtown to The Shed (very near the Shed). This means I can hold out for the rare times I find Hok Week in passing, or I can sell a few unused resources and buy it.
* Genetic Engineering and Cloning is pretty easy and very useful (probably _too_ useful).
* I found a lake with a lot of Freshwater Fish spawns, as well as some sea plants. It's near the location "Fishing Shed" in FPR territory. This means as long as I occasionally trek out there I have all the fish I could want. Since they're harvest points you get a good number of fish from one to two passes through the lake. Also, fish harvest points give you a selection of different kinds of fish, which was a pleasant surprise. I expected each lake to only have one or two kinds of fish.
* My cooking progress is being stymied by being unable to create Specialty Cuts of meat. Some of the recipes that are least demanding as far as interconnected ingredients need the high-end meat cuts. I've been told there's a book I can get if I do enough cooking missions. However, the game refuses to offer me cooking missions. I have successfully made Broth and some of the staple products. 

I would like to see something in-game that provides a clear route towards crafting specific end-products. The Craft Map web site is nice, but it's not always up-to-date and the connections between ingredients aren't always clear. I'm sure the maintainer tries, but the game is rapidly shifting and devs are constantly adding new recipes. Counting on a third-party web site to provide information that's only available in a collection of badly-formatted hyperlinks is more lazy development. 

Also, I want to emphasize that although I've found some recipes that resulted in a small sense of accomplishment, other than bandages and genetic engineering, I'm still struggling to be able to make anything that has a tangible use in game.

=== Crafting Update (2 Months) ===

* After starting to map resource locations here on the wiki, I can branch out into different recipes much more easily. According to the devs, they've designed the crafting to be limited by your inventory space. But once you know where to go to get materials, you can craft a few things, toss them into the bank, sell or trash your leftover scrap items, and then harvest fresh materials for the next stage. 
* Fish completely break the system. Every kind of fish, shellfish, and sea plant are found in any fish location, which happens to be pretty much every large lake. By simply swimming back and forth for an hour, you can collect hundreds of each fish. With those fish you can then make a wide range of core components needed in all the trees, like fluxes, bases, acids, and coolants. Fish are also edible, and used in Genetic Engineering and Pharmaceuticals. Fish also only need a few recipes, which means less time to master their products than other raw materials.
* Having a wide selection of raw materials available with one day of harvesting allows me to dabble in different trees. This gives me a better sense of how things connect together. I still feel the system is needlessly complex and I'm still frustrated by the lack of low-level tangible components. But with my own Noob page and the CraftMap site I can jump into crafting pretty much anything. Whatever I make won't be "good", but it will be all my own work.
* I still can't find the book with Specialty Cuts of meat. I've made several different food buffs (as well as all the staples and complex ingredients to make the buffs) and the game still refuses to offer me cooking missions :(.
* My Genetic Engineering and Bandage making skills are progressing nicely. I can now do Simple Genetic Recombination, which means I can (for example) make a Poisonous Setlang.
* As long as you don't need specialty books, you can get by without anyone else "helping" you. If you do need a specialty book, you can mission for enough cash to buy them in the AH (unless no one sells them, like the meat cuts book).

By not specializing in anything, my skills tend to be quite weak. Even my good skills are "Average". However, I've thoroughly learned the cooking tree, and I hope to just as thoroughly learn other trees. Once I'm out of alpha testing, I can then focus on just the skills I'm interested in, and I'll still be able to make things from raw materials to end product.

=== Crafting Update (3 Months) ===

At the start of my third month, I made chocolate. I finally found a patch of placebo plants and was able to make F grade chocolate. To celebrate, I'm shelving the game. As I said elsewhere, I came to the game for the crafting, and if I leave, it will be for the crafting.

That's only partially true. It's a combination of crafting and community. I've burned out from trying to figure out how to play the game and being told repeatedly by the developers that play styles that involve anything other than crafting one tiny widget in a large and active nation are "wrong". I would have loved to join a large and active nation in the alpha testing period. After months of asking around within the game, no nations would recruit me (nor was I able to find people to run with in more casual groups). The developers use "you're just playing it wrong" as an excuse to avoid creating necessary systems, or to avoid overhauling deeply flawed mechanics. 

In a strange bit of irony, they refuse to implement any sort of Looking For Group system, or any other system that would make it easier to find like-minded people to join together in casual play or nations. 

I'll let the game sit and go back to it once it launches. Once there's an active player base the situation should improve dramatically.

=== Crafting Update (4 Months) ===

I took a break from playing to put a lot of time into providing feedback on the forums. 

The Craftmap site got a huge update, which motivated me to try a little more crafting. I finally got the Butchering book, which motivated me to try even more.

Some exciting news is that the devs have finally broken down and started adding simplified crafting recipes into the system. This isn't because of *me* but it is because of consistent feedback from people *like me* pointing out the frustratingly disorganized and unwelcoming crafting system. They're going to pinpoint additions that will allow players to make things simple starter things for themselves and bootstrap themselves up to making more sophisticated items later.

Spawn points for pretty much everything have been reduced across the FPR side of the map (which means it probably happened in OWON territory as well). This is a good thing and it happens to mean that fish are a little less useful as a source of different chemicals. It's a weird state of affairs. If you want to dabble in crafting a couple things they're still overpoweringly awesome. If you want to make something that requires a specific fish, you're only getting 1/7 of the raw materials you need on any pass through a lake. A dedicated fish harvester either has to sell their haul to a seven different buyers, or a smaller pool of buyers who each need multiple different fish.

They've also reduced the frequency with which they blame poor systems on play styles.

=== A Loose Map to Harvesting Spots I Use (FPR - Freedomtown) ===

Once the game goes "live" and there's a full player population, resource spawn locations will be contested and thus very valuable. But what kind of noob helper would I be if I kept something so basic all to myself?

I'm working out from Freedomtown. I mostly visit the Shacks, the Shed, Mitchell Farm, and down by the Fishing Shed.

Note: After hunting down and noting all these locations, a dev finally pointed me to an alternate location for the in-game database. On both my linux and windows installs, the "g" key doesn't open the database. A dev finally pointed out I could alternately get to the database by choosing that option in the Esc menu.  With a combination of the in-game Database and the surveying tool (click on the compass in the mini-menu), you can hunt down any resource in the game. Still, I think it can be useful to have a written set of directions to get to specific spawn points.

* Meat animals. Vultures and setlangs are found just outside the west and south gates. The south has a richer concentration and you're more likely to be swarmed. You can also find tame-able nancoots to the south. There's usually at least one baby setlang or baby vulture along the east road.
* Sarnium and Calibrite. Just south of the Freedomtown gate, then turn left, is an area where two rocks spawn. This area will be full of low-level dangerous animals.
* Mozanite, Copper, and Alluvium (some Rock Parasites). Further south of the south Freedomtown gate if you stay on the road, is a large spawn point for Mozanite. Go out the south gate near the workshop and head past the animal spawns. There's a flat, open area with almost no trees and lots of mining deposits. There's a few Copper rocks as well. If you head down the slope of the ridge a little bit there's usually a couple Alluvium rocks (they can spit out gold and silver). While most of the time you'll get Metal Wasps, if you mine for a while you'll also probably pull a few Rock Parasites.
* Ectoparasites and Diseased Brains. I use Metal Wasp ectoparasites that I find in the Copper rocks near Freedomtown. Just beyond these rocks you can find some Elkar with Diseased Brains.
* Raxin. Go to the Shed. Then, go down the hill towards the water. There are always lots of Raxin here.
* Freshwater Fish. There's one if I get lost going from Freedomtown to the Shed. It's right where it says "Arboleda" on the map.
* Lurker Lake: Freshwater Fish and Lurkers. There's a super-dense lake under the section of the map that says Southeast of Freedomtown. This one lake could support a small fishing village! The northern side probably has more clusters of fish, but the shape of the bottom of the lake is very awkward. The southern side still has an amazing number of spawn points and it's easier to swim around and fish.  Avoid the edges or the Lurkers may get you!
* Seasoning Mix. Lesapen Stalks can be found near Mitchell's Farm. Follow the road up to the ridge, and then keep going. The Lesapen stalks have orange nodules. Ngooberry is a weed right outside Freedomtown's east gate.
* Elkar. They are also found on the ridge "above" Mitchell's Farm guarding the Hok Weed and Lesapen stalks.
* Hok Weed and Hok Weed Leaf. There's a small patch of Hok Weed up in the ridge area above Mitchell's Farm. The Hok Weed has orange nodules.
* Anjara Trees. These grow in the same general area as the Lesapen Stalks, Kosha Plants, and Hok Weed, on the Mitchell Farm ridge. They're useful as a generic source of cooking wood, and because they drop the citrus Anjara Fruit.
* Kosha Plant. This is found growing as a weed right outside Freedomtown's east gate. These plants have yellow nodules. There are some mixed in with the other plants on the ridge above Mitchell Farm.
* Lilacs. They're good for "any" plant requirements or pharmaceuticals. Lilacs grow as a weed just south of the Shacks.
* Takayura wood and Hudson Fir. A stand of these two trees grows somewhere along the road that goes east into the Shed. It's almost perfectly equidistant between the Westwoods and Twin Falls map markers. If you're following the road from Freedomtown to the Shed, you have to keep an eye out and turn left off the road.
* Iron and Aquaios Rocks. Just south of the Takayura and Hudson stand on the road east of the Shed. They're guarded by the poop-flinging monkeys.
* Samr Berry and Pechem Trees. Samr Berry plants and Pechem trees are found on the road between Freedomtown and the Shed in the twisty rock formations between Outside Freedomtown and Westwoods. The berry plant path is between two very large pale rocks on the area map and is found on the main road.
* Niurevium and Kupleskite rocks. Between the Northern Range and Bald Forest, along the small north loop off the main road. You have to walk around a large rock to reach the deposit. The Niurevium rocks can produce Greenockite, which is needed to make battery acid.
* Anjara and Takayura trees (and a bank and crafting station). A peaceful forestry crafting area can be found at Baldy Station, with a giant stand of Anjara and Takayura trees. You can extract contaminated water and do all kinds of logging crafting.

==== Harder FPR Areas ====

* Ngooberries and Placebo Plant. There's a patch of them northeast of Thicket Overwatch and "above" the map marker that says "Judair Gulch".
* Albus and Geel Flowers and Maypuri and Jessup trees. Albus and Geel flowers, and a tree stand with Maypuri and Jessup softwood trees forms a triangle with the Ngooberries and Placebo Plant in Judair Gulch.
* Cree'it and Oudomi Trees. Pratinous Flowers and Kosha Plants. These can be found at the Jenkins Ranch. The tree stand is at the label Sapless Mesa on the map.
* Placebo Plant and Ngooberry Plants. There's a scattering of Placebo Plants and Ngooberries just southeast of Norris Genetic Foundation above where it says "Bowrock Plains" on the map.
* Iron, Pyrohemitite, and Tungsten Rocks. Drake's Pass is a sideways "S" curve. Looking at the map, the east side of the curve (the bowl side rather than the dome side) has these rocks.
* Elkar and Raxin. Elkar Woods in Thicket Overwatch is full of Elkar. Where there's no Elkar, there's Raxin.

=== A Loose Map to Harvesting Spots I Use (NEU - Sept Falls) ===

Having spent two months mapping the resources in and around Freedomtown, I decided to jaunt over to Sept Falls. I'm hoping to expand my collection of harvest locations. This will only be added to intermittently as I discovered on my first visit that the wildlife is quite tough.

* Lilac and Lesapen Fruit. Out the North gate and just above where it says Northern Trails.

=== Recipes Used In All The Trees ===

A note about Heat Sources: You can simply harvest up a stack of wood and use that as a heat source, or use the Logging recipes to turn different wood stacks into firewood. I craft mine by creating Animal Fat. Animal Fat is rendered from any Slab (including Setlang and Vulture) and Purified Water. Animal Fat has uses in higher level crafting recipes and this is an "easy" way to skill the recipe without having to think about it. It's also an "easy" way to skill up Purified Water (which will be vital if you do any Cooking).

A note about Contaminated Water. I use the Scrounge For Water ability to get Contaminated Water. It can be found in any area that's not part of a city zone. Every noob with any intention of crafting *anything* should pick up the Scrounge For Water ability. Water harvesters are also available.

A note about Recipe books. I would run some missions and buy every basic recipe book I could find before doing _any_ crafting as a noob. The basic books can be found at the assorted NPC vendors in your starting city. Needed recipes are scattered through so many trees this is significantly easier and less frustrating than trying to min-max components to craft using the fewest number of recipes. Later you can take the time to only buy the Advanced recipe books you need. 

'''Water Purification Tablets'''

You will need Iodine Clusters. They are mined from Aquaios rocks. 

* Make Water Purification Tablets by combining Iodine Clusters with Animal Fat. This is a Mining recipe called Mineral Breakdown.

'''Animal Fat'''

You will need a meat slab. I mostly use setlang and vulture meat.

# Make Purified Water by combining Contaminated Water with Purification Tablets. This is a Culinary Arts recipe called Purified Water.
# Make Animal Fat by combining any Slab with Purified Water. This is a Culinary Arts recipe called Excess Fat Extraction.

'''Cellulose'''

Cellulose is a Flux, which is needed in most of the trees that are touched by metal products.

Cellulose comes from combining any plant with Distilled Water, using the Foraging recipe Chemical Extraction: Foraging. There is a caveat to the "any Plant" part, in that combining the plants has to produce a component separate from the Cellulose. This means Lilac won't work, but things like Hok Weed and Samr Berry will. This is a great way to use up leftover plants.

==== Basic Things to Make With Fish ====

By using one of the Chemical Extraction recipes in the Fishing tree, you can make a number of basic chemical components that are useful in all the trees. Some recipes produce multiple products in one run.

''' Freshwater Fish'''

Freshweater Fish are found in most large bodies of water. They require the Fishing recipe called Chemical Extraction: Fish.

* Acid: Make Formic Acid by combining Spherefish Fish Meat with Distilled Water. 
* Acid, Refinement Agent: Make Nitric Acid by combining Electrophorus Fish Meat with Distilled Water. 
* Buffer Solution: Make Xylene Cyanol by combining Electrophorus Fish Meat with Distilled Water. 
* Lubricant: Make Myxini Gel by combining Myxini Fish Meat with Distilled Water.
* Base: Make Sodium Bicarbinate by combining Tilapiine Fish Meat with Distilled Water. 
* Coolant, Anti-Freeze, Refinement Agent: Make Anti-Freeze by combining Cod Fish Meat with Distilled Water. 
* Chemical, Transitional Chemical: Make Strontium Sulfate by combining Crystal Fish Meat with Distilled Water.
* Chemical: Make Bromine by combining Koine Fish Meat with Distilled Water.
* Medical Compound: Make Toxinblock Compound by combining Koine Fish Meat with Distilled Water.

''' Sea Plants '''

Sea Plants are very similar to Freshwater Fish, and are found in the same locations. They mostly require the Fishing recipe called Chemical Extraction: Sea Plants, although there is one Cooking recipe as well.

* Acid:  Make Carbonic Acid by combining Salty Porypha with any Heat Source. 
* Chemical Salt: Chemical Salt by combining Salty Porypha with any Heat Source.
* Salt (for cooking): Salt by combining Salty Porypha with any Heat Source using Special Extraction: Sea Plants in the Culinary Arts tree.


''' Shellfish '''

Shellfish are very similar to Freshwater Fish, and are found in the same locations. They have a small selection of Fishing recipes.
* Make Shells by combining Crustacean and Purified Water. This is a Fishing recipe called Crustacean Extraction.
* Flux, Chemical: Make Calcium Carbonate by combining Shells and Cheesecloth. This is a Fishing Recipe called Calcium Carbonate Extraction.

== Leveling a Medic ==

Medics are the healers of The Repopulation. They heal targets using a Medical Scanner and the First Aid skill.

The Repopulation Devs have apparently decided to make it very difficult to level the First Aid skill. Medical scanners are ranged weapons, and cannot be dual-wielded with an off-hand ranged weapon that works. By that I mean you can have a pistol in your off hand, but it won't fire. Nor will a melee weapon or unarmed handwraps work in the off hand. This means if you carry anything in your off hand, it will likely be a shield.

Although they're ranged weapons, scanners do not have any low-level ranged attacks. This means the only way a noob can do damage while holding a scanner is to club their target with it in close combat. If you're going to do this it may be a good idea to wear heavy armor.

Also, using the scanner as a weapon increases your First Aid skill, which means that training in an alternate ranged or melee weapon first won't help. In order to club people effectively with your scanner, you need to improve the First Aid skill. The best way to get effective enough to using the scanner as an attack club is by doing something else to skill through the first few weak ranks of First Aid.

Here is a list of what I've tried:

* Finding other people to group with and healing them as they kill mobs would be the optimal option. However, I'm finding people are not welcoming to noobs on the alpha servers (not even other noobs). This means soloing most of the time. I've taken to lurking along the paths of some areas where people commonly mission/harvest and jumping out of the bushes to heal them. I wouldn't recommend this as a leveling plan.
* Shield and scanner did not work for me. Others report success. At first I couldn't find a shield in the AH, and after I did it wasn't enough protection to keep me alive (while clubbing targets). Since fighting with a medical scanner gives First Aid experience, this means you can't spend combat SI on improving the clubbing attack. 
* You can spend Beneficial SI on First Aid skills. 
* Setlangs often run away if you get them down to a state where they only need 1 more hit to die. I had a tiny amount of success with shooting setlangs until they ran away, swapping to my scanner, healing myself, and then swapping back to my gun to shoot the setlang. This was too slow to constructively level.
* I bought some polyester filaments, made some fish antibiotic, and rolled my own bandages. This was too expensive to constructively level. Even after figuring out how to harvest the materials to make Hudson Cloth and where to harvest Spherefish, I still don't recommend this as a way to level. After launch, it will be a viable way to make bandages using sweat equity instead of buying them from vendors or the AH.
* I lucked into a Youtube video that explained how to genetically engineer pets. This is actually _very_ easy and is only a couple crafting steps. I summon a cloned setlang or vulture and use it as an attack pet. I equip my scanner and spam heals. If something aggros on me I simply stop healing them and the pet will get aggro back. I've made reasonable progress levelling my first aid skill this way, and my Genetic Engineering skills are levelling even faster as well.
* You can tame pets. If you pick up the pet-handling skills in the tutorial, tamed pets are a better choice than cloned pets. If you have no pet-handling skills I'd recommend starting with genetic engineering. You have to spend a lot of a limited number of "repop" points on buying the assorted pet commands (tame, feed, calm, tend) or hope they're given to you as mission rewards while cloned just cost a little in game cash.
* Someone suggested holding a medical scanner and throwing grenades at mobs. Grenades are a special consumable weapon that don't take a weapon slot. So you can hold a scanner and throw a grenade.

My medic and resource gatherer may turn into medic and creature handler.

=== Healing For Medics ===

Your starting abilities are: 
* Medical Scan - a one-shot heal that restores a small amount of health.
* Revive - revives a dead person on site, so they don't return to the cloning center.
* Bandage Wound - a small heal over time that, according to the tooltip, restores 7 health every 3 seconds for 60 seconds. This tooltip is incorrect and it appears to work off your First Aid skill (the higher my skill the better my Bandage Wounds healing appears to be). It may or may not also work off the quality of your bandages. Requires bandages. Does not require a medical scanner to be equipped.

=== Basic Bandage Crafting ===

Your noob, "First level" heal over time activated power is called Bandage Wound. It requires bandages to activate.

You can buy bandages from any medical vendor for 3 currency per bandage. You can also roll your own in the crafting system, but it's a bit of work to make the cloth component for bandages. The antibiotic is do-able even with minimal skills.

If you want to roll your own bandages I suggest making the antibiotic (it's a good way to learn how crafting works) and buy the cloth. If you want to get into more serious crafting, making the bandages from start to finish is a good idea, by making the antibiotic and Hudson Fabric.

==== Making a Bandage====
* Buy Polyester Filaments, Hudson Fabric, or another kind of cloth in the Auction House.
* Myxococcus Xanthus antibiotic. The wiki says to make bandages you need "cloth and a sterilizing agent". The wiki lies. Sterilizing agent is a crafting ingredient that does _not_ work in bandage production. The only thing I've been able to find that does work is Myxococcus Xanthus antibiotic.

How to make the bandages. Have the cloth and antibiotic in your inventory.

* Make Bandages by combining Polyester Filaments or Hudson Fabric with Myxococcus Xanthus. This is a First Aid recipe called Bandage Production.

Note: When you roll bandages, you get 10 bandages per batch. So, 1 section of cloth = 10 bandages.

====Myxococcus Xanthus Antibiotic====

You will need Spherefish Fish Meat. I loot Spherefish off Lesoo, and I've also harvested them in large bodies of water that spawn Fresh Water Fish.

* Make Myxococcus Xanthus by combining Spherefish and Animal Fat. This is a Fishing recipe called Pharmaceuticals Extraction: Fishing.

====Making Hudson Fabric====

You will need to purchase Sterilizing Agent or make your own.

# Make Potassium Bioxalate by combining Hok Weed with Distilled Water. This is a Foraging recipe called Chemical Extraction: Foraging
# Make Hudson Moss by combining Hudson Fir Wood with any heat source and Distilled Water. This is a Logging recipe called Destructive Distillation: Softwood.
# Make Hudson Fabric by combining Hudson Moss with Potassium Bioxalate and Sterilizing Agent. This is a Tailoring recipe called Textile Spinning.

=== Advanced Medical Fitting Crafting ===

The only other "thing" that can be directly crafted under the First Aid skill other than Bandages is Medical Fittings. The components will come from a wide range of skill trees, including Pharmaceuticals, Chemistry, Robotics and Mining.

==== Nanites ====

Looking over Medical Fittings, it's very complicated (just like every other fitting crafting), but it looks like Nantite crafting could be managed by a single crafter.

'''Ethanol'''
# Make Ethylene by combining Samr Berries with Distilled Water. This is a Foraging recipe called Chemical Extraction: Foraging.
# Make Carbonic Acid by combining Salty Porypha with a heat source like Animal Fat. This is a Fishing recipe called Chemical Extraction: Sea Plants.
# Make Ethanol by combining Ethylene with Carbonic Acid and Distilled Water. This is a Chemistry recipe called Chemical Acidification.

'''Nanites '''
* Make a Nanite by combining a catalyst like Ethanol with Calibrite Ore. This is a Pharmaceuticals recipe called Basic Nanite Production.

== Genetic Engineering ==

It's possible to genetically engineer your own cloned pets. Cloned pets are single-use. If you log out they go away, if you dismiss them they go away, if they die they go away. They have a time limit as well, I'm not sure how long it is. Occasionally, when my cloned pet lives for a while, I get a message that they expired.

If you summon a cloned pet and set it to attack things, you can hang back and heal the pet. This is a great way to gain First Aid experience. Since they're "your" pet you get credit for all the kills and for quest completions and the like. You can harvest anything they kill. If you don't want to use them as heal targets, you can simply use them to get aggro/distract/for DPS.

Note: Unlike pets you tame, cloned pets don't need silly things like food, medicine, and affection. They will likely die of wounds if you don't Bandage Wounds or use a medical scanner on them, while in tough combats.

=== The Basic Quick and Dirty Method ===

# To start, go out and kill a metric ton of setlangs and vultures. Harvest each corpse. You want a lot of DNA Samples and Tissue Samples.
# Go any Medical center and buy the skill book Basic Genetic Engineering. It will cost 100 currency units. Buy a large stack of Sterilizing Agents. They cost 15 currency units each. I buy them in stacks of 99 (the game won't let me buy 100).
# Make Biomass by combining any Tissue Samples and Sterilizing Agent. This is a Genetic Engineering recipe called Biomass Reclamation.
# Make Cloned Setlangs by combining Setlang DNA Samples and Biomass. This is a Genetic Engineering recipe called Clone Species.

You will end up with an icon in your inventory that looks like a bird cage. Drop the stack in your quick bars and you can summon at need. You can carry cloned pets in stacks of up to 20.

=== Advanced Genetic Engineering Crafting ===

When you start in Genetic Engineering, you'll probably want to buy Sterilizing Solution from the Medical vendor. After you get good at it, to control every step of the cloning process you need to use crafted Sterilizing Solution.

'''Hydrogen Peroxide Sterilizing Solution'''

You will need Baryte Clusters. They are mined from Pyrohemalite rocks.

# Make Sulfuric Acid by combining Kosha Plant with Distilled Water. This is a Foraging recipe called Chemical Extraction: Foraging.
# Make Hydrogen Peroxide by combining Sulfuric Acid with Baryte Clusters and Distilled Water. This is a Chemistry recipe called Mineral Acidification.

'''Aqueous Silver Sulfide Sterilizing Solution'''

You will need Argentite Clusters. They are mined from Maeglium rocks.

# Make Nitric Acid by combining Electrophorus Fish Meat and Distilled Water. This is a Fishing recipe called Chemical Extraction: Fish.
# Create Aqueous Silver Sulfide by combing Nitric Acid with Argentite Clusters and Distilled Water. This is a Chemistry recipe called Mineral Acidification.

The Nitric Acid recipe also produces Xylene Cyanol which is used to make Ligase.

'''Ligase'''

Ligase needs "any" Buffer solution. Luckily, you get the buffer Xylene Cyanol by running Chemical Extraction on Electrophorus Fish, which is useful in making your own Sterilizing Solution.

# Make Xylene Cyanol by combining Electrophorus Fish Meat and Distilled Water. This is a Fishing recipe called Chemical Extraction: Fish.
# Make Ligase by combining any Fish Meat with a buffer solution like Xylene Cyanol. This is a  Pharmaceuticals recipe called Ligase Production.

'''Basic Genetic Recombination'''

You will need Biomass, Ligase, and a Stabilized Prion Vector for Basic Genetic Recombination, as well as Primary and Secondary DNA. For the ectoparasite I use Metal Wasps. Rutting Tree Beetles also work.

# Make Biomass by combining any Tissue Samples and Sterilizing Agent. This is a Genetic Engineering recipe called Biomass Reclamation. 
# Make a Stabilized Prion Vector by combining Diseased Brain Tissue with an Ectoparasite and Sterilizing Solution. This is a Genetic Engineering recipe called Prion Disease Stabilization.
# Make Ligase by combining any Fish Meat with a buffer solution like Xylene Cyanol. This is a  Pharmaceuticals recipe called Ligase Production.
 
Combine the above with your primary and secondary DNA. Voila! A genetically modified cloned pet!

== Fishing in Repopulation ==

You can fish one of two ways. The first way is to use a fishing pole. This will work with any size body of water, as long as it's coded for fish. You get a random assortment of fish this way.

The second is to use a speargun to  harvest fish spawn points underwater. This requires large bodies of water where you can swim.

=== Pole Fishing ===

Many dirty puddles of water scattered around cities can be fished, along with the more obvious ponds and lakes found in the wilderness.

To have the correct supplies, go to the Workshop in your city and speak to the Harvesting Tools vendor.

* Buy the book A Fisherman's Guide for 100 currency units.
* Buy a fishing pole for 25 currency units.
* Buy some lures. The vendor has three types. I bought a 5-pack of each for 75 currency units per pack.

In Freedomtown, you can fish just north of the Medical center. Stand in the puddle north of the medical center until the water is about thigh-deep. If you  try to cast the line and get told you can't fish there, just move around a bit.

Put the fishing pole into a quick bar slot. Click on the pole. You'll get a quick casting animation and you'll see the float bobbing on the water. There will be a "splash" animation in the water when the float lands.

One the line is cast, you get a smaller mini-game bar with an image of a hooked fish.

If you see a second "splash" animation, click on the hooked fish in the mini-game bar, or tap the number "1". This will attempt to reel in the fish. It will either tell you what fish you caught, or tell you that you didn't catch anything this time.

Repeat as many times as you like. While your skills are still low you will gain a point in fishing every time you successfully reel in fish. It takes 40 points to get out of the Poor skill level.

=== Speargun Fishing ===

Fish spawns can be found in large bodies of water scattered around the world. They work in a similar way to tree wood and rock mineral spawns.

To have the correct supplies, go to the Workshop in your city and speak to the Harvesting Tools vendor.

* Buy the book A Fisherman's Guide for 100 currency units.
* Buy a second hand Speargun for 100 currency units.

Dive into any lake with orange resource bubbles showing inside the border of the water. The fish will be small clusters of 2-3 fish that blend into the ground. Use your mini-map! You don't need any sort of diving gear (you can't run out of air), but you will need a speargun to harvest the fish.

== Cooking in Repopulate ==

Cooking started just as frustrating as the rest of the crafting system, but became slightly more manageable once I realized that fishing is the secret to successful cooking.

=== Making the Staples ===

The food term "Staples" refers to a collection of basic (usually non-perishable) food items used to prepare meals. Examples of staples include flour, salt, cooking oils, dried or smoked meat, dried pasta, and canned fruits and vegetables. Milk, eggs, and cheese are often loosely included in the term, although they each spoil easily.

In Repopulate, staples are combined to create an assortment of complex ingredients.

The two most basic items you need are Vitamin Spray and Seasoning Mix. A Preservative is also crucial to have on hand. When poking through the assorted Preservative recipes, Sodium Nitrate appeared to be the least complicated to make as it comes from fish products and fish are used throughout cooking.

'''Vitamin Spray'''

Collect Cod and Limestone clusters.

# Make Calcium Carbonate by combining Limestone with a heat source like Animal Fat. This is a Mining recipe called Mineral Breakdown.
# Make Omega-3 Fish Oil by combining Cod and Animal Fat. This is a Fishing recipe called Pharmaceuticals Extraction: Fishing.
# Make Vitamin Spray by combining Calcium Carbonate, Omega-3 Fish Oil, and Purified Water. This is a Pharmaceuticals recipe called Vitamin Spray.

'''Sodium Nitrate Preservative'''

This requires Nitric acid, Sodium Bicarbonate, and Distilled Water.

# Make Nitric Acid by combining Electrophorus Fish Meat with Distilled Water. This a Fishing recipe called Chemical Extraction: Fishing.
# Make Sodium Bicarbonate by combining Tilapiine Fish Meat with Distilled Water. This is a Fishing recipe called Chemical Extraction: Fishing.
# Make Sodium Nitrate by combining Nitric Acid with Sodium Bicarbonate and Distilled Water. This is a Chemistry recipe called Acid-Base Reactions.

''' Meat Tenderizer '''

* Make Meat Tenderizer by combining any Preservative with any Plant. This is a Foraging recipe called Meat Tenderizer.

''' Seasoning Mix '''

Seasoning Mix is similar to dried mixed herbs. It's not connected to Seasoning.

* Make Seasoning Mix by combining any savory spice like Lesapen Stalk with any savory herb like Ngooberry Stem and Vitamin Spray. This is a Culinary Arts recipe called Seasoning Mix. 

Lesapen Stalk is a Savory Spice, and Ngooberry Stem is a Savory Herb.

'''Seasoning'''

Seasoning is similar to salt or pepper. It's not connected to Seasoning Mix.

* Make Seasoning by combining any Plant with Vitamin Spray. This is a Foraging recipe called Seasoning.

'''Milk (Hok Sap and Hok Milk)'''

I found two recipes that appear to be useful to make a kind of milk. "Hok Sap" and "Hok Milk". Both come from Hok Weed.

Hok Sap:

* Make Hok Sap by combining Hok Weed with Distilled Water. This is a Foraging recipe called Chemical Extraction: Foraging.

This recipe also produces Cellulose and Potassium Bioxalate.

Hok Milk:

* Make Hok Milk by combining Purified Water with Hok Weed and Sodium Nitrate Preservative. This is a Culinary Arts recipe called Special Extraction: Plants.

Hok Sap is 1 unit per batch, while Hok Milk is 10 units per batch. 

'''Vegetable Oil'''

Seed-producing plants are Geel Flowers, Azul Flowers, Lesapen Stalk, and Hok Weed.

# Make any Seed by combining any seed-producing Plant and Vitamin Spray. This is a Foraging recipe called Seed Extraction.
# Make Vegetable Oil by combining any Seed with Sodium Nitrate Preservative. This is a Culinary Arts recipe called Vegetable Oil.

'''Mild Vegetables'''

Sources of Mild Vegetables are Kosha Plant and Lesapen Stalk.

* Make Mild Vegetables by combining any Plant with Vitamin Spray. This is a Foraging recipe called Fruit Preparation.

This recipe also produces an appropriate plant Fruit.

'''Hot Vegetables'''

Sources of Hot Vegetables are Lilac, Albus, and Green Leaf.

* Make Hot Vegetables by combining any Plant with Purified Water. This is a Foraging recipe called Plant Breakdown.

Lilac only produces hot "Lilac Root" with a grade of B0 or better.

=== Complex Ingredients ===

I'm using complex ingredients to refer to combinations of staple items that form parts of meals.

'''Fish Chunks'''

Because all culinary goodness starts with fish!

* Make Fish Chunks by combining any Fish Meat with Sodium Nitrate Preservative and Purified Water. This is a Fishing recipe called Seafood Extraction.

'''Raw Fish Fillet'''

You will need Myxini, Tilapiine, or Cod Fish Meat.

* Make Raw Fish Fillet by combining any Wood Log with Fish Meat and Seasoning and Purified Water. This is a Culinary Arts recipe called Fish Fillet.

I have _no idea_ why a raw fish item is produced by using a heat source!

'''Specialty Cuts'''

This requires the cookbook: Culinary Arts: Butchering. In Freedomtown you get this from Cleo Bores.

The speciality cuts are all named: shoulder cut, loin cut, rib cut, round cut. In each case there's a corresponding "steak" version as well.

* Make any Specialty Cut by combing any Slab with Sodium Nitrate Preservative. This is a Culinary Arts recipe named after the cut.

'''Dicing'''

Once you have some specialty cut meat, you can dice it.

* Make Diced Meat by combining any Specialty Cut with Seasoning Mix. This is a Culinary Arts recipe called Dicing.

=== Food Buffs ===

Now that we have some staples and complex ingredients, we can combine them to create some food buffs.

'''Seafood Salad'''

* Make Seafood Salad by combining any Mild Vegetables with Fish Chunks and Omega-3 Fish Oil. This is a Culinary Arts recipe called Seafood Salad.

Kosha Plant Root is a Mild Vegetable. Omega-3 Fish Oil is part of making Vitamin Spray.

This provides two buffs:
* Full Stomach. A small bonus to Health recovery. Lasts for 5 minutes.
* Drinking Water. A small bonus to Endurance recovery. Lasts for 2 1/2 minutes.

'''Cooked Fish Fillet'''

* Make Cooked Fish Fillet by combining Raw Fish Fillet with Seasoning Mix and Animal Fat. This is a Culinary Arts recipe called Grilled Fillet.

This provides one buff:
* Full Stomach. A small bonus to Health recovery. Lasts for 10 minutes.

== Mining ==

Mining is a basic tree that processes materials for other trees (particularly Metalworking and Robotics).

Ores are metals, like copper, silver, gold, calibrite, etc.
Minerals are materials like gypsum, limestone, anthracite, etc.

=== Simple Mining Recipes ===

'''Plate Metal'''

Tigwyk, the awesome Repopulate newbie guy swears by Plate Metal. It's a good place to drop random ores and minerals you may collect by running around mining.

As I showed in the section on how to make different products with Fish, you can make the flux Calcium Carbonate. Or you can refine the flux Cellulose from certain trees or plants. So, with minimal effort you can harvest a random ore and a random mineral outside any of the starter cities, mix it with a random flux, and have a useful compound.

* Make Plate Metal by combining any Ore with any Mineral and any Flux. This is a Metalworking recipe called Plate Metal Fabrication.
