& Ghouls
& Ghoul PCs
[header(Ghoul PCs)]
  - It is recommended (but not required) that Ghoul PCs have an off-stage, statless NPC domitor.
  - Discipline level is limited by [pcol(Domitor (Background))] regardless of PC or NPC domitor (WW2021/71).
    - [pcol(Domitor (Background))]:[argcol(0-3)]: Each discipline is limited to 1 dot
    - [pcol(Domitor (Background))]:[argcol(4)]:   Each discipline is limited to 2 dots
    - [pcol(Domitor (Background))]:[argcol(5)]:   Each discipline is limited to 3 dots
    - [pcol(Domitor (Background))] can be purchased like any other background.
  - Upon becoming a ghoul (Cgen or IC), the Ghoul gets [pcol(Potence)]:[argcol(1)], and 1 dot of an in-clan discipline.
  - All ghouls must have [pcol(Clan)] set on their sheet.
  - All ghouls must have [pcol(Domitor)] set on their sheet. This may be set to [argcol(NPC)].
  - Ghouls may not have [pcol(Thaumaturgy)].
  - Disciplines are retained when a Ghoul is embraced.
    - However, if the Ghoul has dots in a restricted discipline and [pcol(Clan)] changes, those dots must be moved into a Common or clan-appropriate Proprietary or Restricted discipline.
      - e.g. Sponge is a Ghoul of [pcol(Clan)]:[argcol(Samedi)] with [pcol(Thanatosis)]:[argcol(2)]. Through a cruel twist of fate he's embraced [pcol(Clan)]:[argcol(Toreador)]. Sponge must remove his [pcol(Thanatosis)]:[argcol(2)] and take a discipline like [pcol(Celerity)]:[argcol(2)] or [pcol(Obfuscate)]:[argcol(2)]
      - If Sponge were embraced into [pcol(Clan)]:[argcol(Followers of Set)], he would be able to take [pcol(Serpentis)]:[argcol(2)]
  - If a ghoul is also a possessed with Rage (from the Berserker power), they make frenzy rolls for both Self-Control and Rage. If a situation applies to both, they frenzy if either roll fails.

& title
& changeling title
[header(Changeling Title)]
[pcol(Title)] background:
 * [pcol(Title)] may be a fief (on-grid or off-grid) or landless.
 * PCs may buy [pcol(Title)] in chargen or with XP.
 * A fief within a PC-run territory requires approval from its PC leaders, similar to 'news changeling counties'.
 * Increasing [pcol(Title)] is time-limited on the same scale as '+rules shifter rank', representing service (on- and off-camera) over time.
 * Increasing [pcol(Title)] to 4 is subject to '+policy PC leadership' and limited to 2 PCs per territory.
 * [pcol(Title)] 5 is reserved for NPCs.

& holdings
& changling holdings
[header(Changeling Holdings)]
[pcol(Holdings)] background:
 * [pcol(Holdings)] may be a freehold (on-grid or off-grid) or just an object that produces Glamour.
 * [pcol(Holdings)] may be bought in chargen or with XP.
 * A freehold within a PC-run territory require approval from its PC leaders, per 'news changeling counties'.
 * Increasing [pcol(Holdings)] is time-limited on the same scale as '+rules shifter rank', representing the need to infuse the balefire with Glamour (CtD page 44).
 * Increasing [pcol(Holdings)] above 3 is at staff discretion.

& kinain
[header(Kinain)]
Characters that wish to be kinain in addition to something else must take this merit:

Kinain (4 pt. Merit)

Although your character is not a changeling, they've got their heritage running through their veins - literally. This merit allows the character to walk in the Dreaming as if they were Fae themselves. While doing so exposes the character to chimerical attack, it also opens them to a new and wondrous world. Their Banality is also quite low (typically two to five) and their presence is often welcome in the courts of the Fae. Naturally, this sort of gift carries an obligation to play Faerie politics. Nevertheless, it can be a wondrous game. This merit also allows the character immunity to the effects of the mists. (pg. 296 MtA Revised)

* Note: This merit has been altered some so as to ensure game balance.

& XP Costs
[header(XP Costs)]
All XP Costs are as stated in the books in use except for:

  - Backgrounds: lvl 1 = 3 xp (After lvl 1 = 2 x current level)
    - Exception: Totem / Jamak / Nushi = 2 xp per dot, regardless of level (WW3801/123)
    - Backgrounds may only be bought per in-sphere restrictions.
  - Rites and Rituals are 3 xp times the level of the rite/ritual.
  - Raising a Mage Sphere is based on current level instead of next level.
  - (Possessed - Kami Only) Buying off a Taint: Taint level x 5. Taints can only be bought off, not lowered.
  - (Possessed - Kami Only) Buying a new power costs level of Power x 5.
  - Ghoul Disciplines:
    - [pcol(Subrace)]:[argcol(Ghoul)]
      - First dot: 15

      - In-clan: 15 x current
      - Out-of-clan: 25 x current

& generation
[header(Generation)]
On City of Hope staff feel that vampires should have a chance to lower their generation via xp. It is up to the individual player to decide on how to rp out this change. Keep in mind that it's a significant faux pas for any vampire to disclose their generation.

  * Generation 12:  10 XP
  * Generation 11:  15 XP
  * Generation 10:  20 XP
  * Generation 9:   30 XP
  * Generation 8:   40 XP

& arete
[header(Arete)]
Normally, a Seeking is required for a Mage to increase their Arete. Instead, we limit the rate at which Mages can raise Arete, using the same chart found in [pcol(+rules shifter rank)]. Additionally, buying up Arete has the following costs:

  * Arete 2: 8 XP
  * Arete 3: 16 XP
  * Arete 4: 24 XP
  * Arete 5: 32 XP
[footer()]

& Linguistics
[header(Linguistics)]
Clarifications on Languages:
  * We don't do per-language skill levels. A language is at 0 or it is at 5.
  * The number of languages you get per level of linguistics is by the books.
  * Your native language is free.
  * Languages per level are thus:
    - Linguistics 1: 1 extra language
    - Linguistics 2: 2 extra languages
    - Linguistics 3: 4 extra languages
    - Linguistics 4: 8 extra languages
    - Linguistics 5: 16 extra languages
  * Once you've reached Linguistics 5, additional languages can be purchased for 3 XP each.
[footer()]

& Renown
[header(Gaining Renown)]
In the books spirits witness your deeds when no one else is around, Galliards sing your praises, and you gain Renown as a direct result of your bravery, and general awesomeness. In tabletop, the Storyteller manages this. On a MU it's generally left to one's peers and those peers don't always give credit where credit is due.

Renown requests can be submitted with [pcol(+renownreq)].

& prestation
[header(Camarilla Prestation)]
  * Status Rating begins with Acknowledged, Camarilla positions, and the Status background as a base.
  * Status is exchanged through boons; when a favor is rendered, status is loaned until the favor is repaid.
  * Kindred agree between themselves on the Status Rating value of a boon and the circumstances under which it is considered repaid.
  * A negative Status Rating carries no explicit penalties, just the lack of social power.
  * In the case of dispute about whether or not a boon has been repaid, a Harpy can make a judgement about the repayment criteria and potentially dismiss a boon.
  * Some decisions will be made by individual vote. The weight of an individual's vote is their Status Rating.
  * Some decisions will be made by clan vote. The Primogen casts a vote that is the sum of the status of the clan members, including those with negative status.
  * Many cultural decisions tend to be made by status such as preference for appointments, etc.
  * Status Rating can be committed by certain member of the court to temporarily nullify the status of others:
    * The 'victim's' status is nullified as long as the enactor’s status is committed.
    * The Prince can negate status at a 3:1 ratio for any member of court.
    * The Seneschal and Harpy can negate status at a 2:1 ratio for any member of court.
    * A Primogen can negate status at a 1:1 ratio for members of their own clan.
  * No kindred may owe another kindred more than their base status.
[footer()]

& Wyrm Taint
[header(Wyrm Taint)]
  * Sense Wyrm is over an area and doesn't pinpoint individuals
    * Everything in the city smells of the Wyrm, including parks
  * Demons with Torment < 6 do not smell of the Wyrm
  * Vampires with a path rating at 7 or higher don't smell of the Wyrm
    * Path of Night at any level smells of the Wyrm
    * Path of Evil Revelations at any level smells of the Wyrm
[footer()]

& Obfuscate
[header(Obfuscate)]
Changes and clarifications for Obfuscate:
  - At CGen, Gargoyles can opt to swap Fortitude, Potence, or Visceretaco for Obfuscate as in-clan.
  - Obfuscate 1 + Stealth is sufficient to travel unnoticed at night.
  - Obfuscate 2 or higher is required to travel in the presence of people.
[footer()]

&Dross
[header(Dross)]
Staff has implemented a new background for Changelings called: [pcol(Dross)]. This background is a measure of a PC's chimerical wealth. This stat will be equivalent to the same level of: [pcol(Resources)], but for chimerical goods. A player can spend xp to buy Dross as per [pcol(+rules XP Cost)].
[footer()]

&The Fog
[header(The Fog)]
There seems to be some misunderstanding of who/what is exactly immune to various forms of supernatural innate powers. The following is a list of what's what for the races that have such:

The Fog - Some are not affected by the Fog: Innocent children, animals, the insane and certain of the other supernatural denizens of the World of Darkness. (pg. 240 WtO 2nd Edition as there is no Revised version)

* Because the book doesn't state exactly which other supernatural denizens of the World of Darkness are immune to the Fog, staff has ruled that the following are immune:

- All Wraiths/Risen (Obviously)
- All Shifters
- All Mages
- All Vampires
- All Changelings
- All Demons
- All Ghouls
- Sorcerers with at least lvl 3 in any numina.
- Psychics with at least lvl 3 in any numina.
- All Possessed
- All Kinfolk
- All Kinain
- Those with the merit: Spirit Sight
[footer()]

&Wraith Misc
[header(Wraith Misc)]
* Argos
  - Cannot be used anywhere where the Tempest can't be easily accessed, including while Embodied, and in the Dreaming or Umbra. Argos 2 (Phantom Wings) may be an exception.
* Outrage
  - Outrage 4 (Death's Touch): Interpret 'heat and extent of the fire' based on WtO page 234 (Sources of Injury -> Fire).
  - Outrage 5 (Obliviate) targets the soul as well as the body. Non-wraith supernaturals are treated the same as mortals.
* Pandemonium
  - Pandemonium 1 (Weirdness) lasts for one turn per success and is limited to small hallucinations. Phantasm is broader in scope.
  - Pandemonium 4 (Foul Humour) can create one point of blood per two successes. Vampires can drink it, but it tastes awful.
* Usury
  - Usury 2 (Charitable Trust) cannot heal aggravated damage. Moliate 2 (Sculpt) can, but is more expensive.
  - Usury 3 (Early Withdrawal) is unsoakable, but again cannot heal aggravated damage.
[footer()]

&The Curse
[header(The Curse)]
There seems to be some misunderstanding of who/what is exactly immune to various forms of supernatural innate powers. The following is a list of what's what for the races that have such:

The Curse - Other animals, especially humans, can sense the predator in a werewolf, and they shy from him. Whenever a Garou's Rage exceeds a human's willpower, the human will avoid contact with the Garou as much as possible. Since the average human's willpower is usually 2 to 4, the Curse is no laughing matter. Wolves are also subject to this dread, and most natural wolves will avoid Garou whenever possible. Garou call this phenomenon the Curse, for it makes normal relationships with humans or wolves all but impossible. (pg. 191-192 WtA Revised)

* Staff ruling for what is considered 'human' and 'animals' are plain, simple, vanilla, everyday mortals/animals with no supernatural powers at all.
[footer()]

&The Delirium
[header(The Delirium)]
There seems to be some misunderstanding of who/what is exactly immune to various forms of supernatural innate powers. The following is a list of what's what for the races that have such:

The Delirium - Werewolves (And many other shifters) preyed on humans for over 3,000 years, and while most humans have no idea that werewolves truly exist, a part of them remembers. The horrible wolf-man the Crinos form (Or battle form for other shifters), incites a kind of madness in humans that Garou call the Delirium.

* Staff ruling for what is considered 'human' and 'animals' are plain, simple, vanilla, everyday mortals/animals with no supernatural powers at all. The following are immune to the Delirium:

- Wraiths/Risen
- All Shifters (Obviously)
- All Mages
- All Vampires
- All Changelings
- All Demons
- All Ghouls
- Sorcerers with at least lvl 3 in any numina.
- Psychics with at least lvl 3 in any numina.
- Possessed with the power: Immunity to the Delirium
- Gorgons
- Drones
- All Kinfolk
- All Kinain
[footer()]

&The Mists
[header(The Mists)]
There seems to be some misunderstanding of who/what is exactly immune to various forms of supernatural innate powers. The following is a list of what's what for the races that have such:

The Mists - The Mists separate the Fae from the mundane, clouding the minds of mortals so that they do not remember the encounters with things faerie. A side effect of Banality, the Mists exemplify the force of human rationality. Most mortals (and unenchanted supernatural beings) do not remember their encounters with the Fae accurately. The Mists are likely to erase much of these memories or at least relegate them to a dream-like quality. The amount of Banality an individual possesses determines exactly what she remembers. (CtD page 208)

- PCs are not 'most people', they're about 0.01%% of the population.
- House rule: PCs affected by the Mists may believe that /something/ supernatural happened, even though they're fuzzy on the details. PCs with lower Banality and/or knowledge of other supernatural things are less likely to be skeptical.
- House rule: PCs may ignore the 'Duration of Coma' column of the chart.

The following are immune to the Mists:

- All Changelings (Obviously)
- All Kinain
- Those with the merit: Spirit Sight

&Revelation
[header(Revelation)]
There seems to be some misunderstanding of who/what is exactly immune to various forms of supernatural innate powers. The following is a list of what's what for the races that have such:

Revelation - Each time a demon uses her Faith, mortal observers can make a Perception + Awareness roll to sense the demon's true nature. The difficulty of the roll is 10 minus the total number of Faith points the character spent (or lost) in the scene. If the difficulty reaches 0, all mortals automatically perceive their true nature. Demons can also allow mortals to perceive their true nature without spending Faith, whenever they wish. Finally, if a character invokes her apocalyptic form (see Chapter Seven for details), mortal witnesses automatically suffer the effects of Revelation. (pg. 254-255 DtF)

* Staff ruling for what is considered 'human' and 'animals' are plain, simple, vanilla, everyday mortals/animals with no supernatural powers at all. The following are immune to Revelation:

- All Wraiths/Risen
- All Shifters
- All Mages
- All Vampires
- All Changelings
- All Demons (Obviously)
- All Ghouls
- Sorcerers with at least lvl 3 in any numina.
- Psychics with at least lvl 3 in any numina.
- All Possessed
- All Kinfolk
- All Kinain

& Drive
[header(Drive)]
Having a dot in an ability means that you have a skill, talent, or knowledge that not everyone has.

In the U.S., just about everyone can drive a car, so we don't require a dot in Drive to be able to drive. This goes for both automatic and manual transmission vehicles and anything that doesn't require a special license, including rentable moving trucks.

Some things that will require Drive:
  * A motorcyle (Drive 1 is sufficient)
  * A finicky or poorly-maintained manual transmission
  * A tractor-trailer, RV, or industrial vehicle (Garbage truck, dump truck, tow truck)
  * Tailing someone without being noticed at normal speeds
  * Tailing someone blatantly at high speeds
  * Evading pursuit
  * Excessive speed (>100 MPH)
[footer()]

& Demon Misc
& Lore of death
[header(Demon Misc)]
  * Demons are innately immune to mind control and fear. Our ruling is that demons are immune to any power that compels them to direct, specific action. Powers can effect a demon's mood, perceptions, and mental effectiveness, but the user of the power cannot direct the demon to take a specific action. Also, no power may compel a demon to act against their Nature. A Caregiver can't be made to abandon their charge, a Judge can't be made to look the other way, a Thrill-Seaker can't be made to take it easy.
  * We feel that Demon powers were written with Mortals in mind and interpret severe effects as applying to Mortals only, unless it is specifically stated otherwise.
  * Extra Actions: All Extra Actions (not split actions), regardless of type, must wait until all players in the round have acted and then occur alternating in order of initiative. This includes Demon extra actions and any other powers which say otherise.

Lore of Death
  * [pcol(Level 2: Decay)] - Agg damage is only against other demons. All other characters take Lethal damage.
  * [pcol(Level 4: Extinguish Life)] - All supernaturals and Mortal+ are treated as demons and may take Agg damage.

Lore of Celestials
  * [pcol(Level 2 (High Tormet):)]
    * It is a mental assault and can be resisted with appropriate powers.
    * The damage is physical and may be soaked by anyone except Mortals and Sorcerer-Psychics.
[footer()]

& Kinfolk
[header(Kinfolk)]
  * Characters that wish to be kinfolk in addition to something else must take the Kinfolk merit (4 points, 5 for vampire + non-BSD kinfolk)
  * House rule: Kinfolk with Gnosis may roll their Gnosis vs the Gauntlet to sidestep into the penumbra. This carries the same risk of getting stuck in the Gauntlet. Kinfolk are also usually woefully unprepared to defend themselves in the umbra. Sidestep at your own peril.
  * Kinfolk may purchase Gnosis merit, but only Kinfolk-specific Gifts.
    * The Gnosis merit is required for Kinfolk-specific Gifts.
  * Kinfolk with Pure Breed can automatically be identified by shifters of their race.
    * Shifters of other races must use Scent of the True Form and get 2+ successes.
    * Your character can start play unaware of their kinfolk-ness, this simply means that (up to that point) no shifter of their race has met them and told them about it.

& sniping
[header(Sniping)]
Here we define 'sniping' to be the use of special abilities or items to discern information about another character. Specific examples include (but are not limited to):
  * Aura Perception
  * Sense Wyrm/Weaver/Wyld
  * Scent of the True Form

Using these abilities requires at a minimum concentration, if not overt actions such as staring, making hand gestures, or licking the subject.

While we may only have a few dozen players logged in a time, Prospect itself is a city of millions. As such, sniping any but the most obvious supers would be exhausting work; you'd get nothing else done. Sniping therefore requires a clear and specific reason to be used on a character, PC or otherwise.

A PC must have done something obviously supernatural to warrant being sniped. A mundane reaction to a supernatural weakness (running from fire) is not sufficient cause for sniping unless the sniper has the relevant sphere's lore at 3.

For example, Willy the Werewolf sees Bob back away from a silver blade nervously. Willy the Werewolf suspects Bob is a BSD. Willy has Lore Garou at 3 and is justified in using Sense Wyrm. Turns out Willy senses no obvious Wyrm signs in the area. To figure out what's up, he uses Scent of the True Form on Bob. Bob happens to be a Mage. Willy sees that Bob isn't a Werewolf at all, he's something else. However, because he doesn't have any dots in Lore Mage, he doesn't know what he's looking at.

If Bob doesn't think he's been presented with sufficient justification for being sniped, he may refuse.

NOTE: This was Sponge's first attempt to capture his thoughts on it. The need for clarification is expected.

& silver
& cold iron
& gold
& fire
& stakes
& sunlight
& kryptonite
[header(Kryptonite)]
The term "kryptonite" is used here as shorthand for "race-specific weakness that causes aggrevated damage or significant disablement for a character because of their race/subrace". Examples include:
  * Silver for Werewolves
  * Cold Iron for Changelings
  * Sunlight, Stakes for Vampires
  * Gold for Corax
  * Reference Book Organization for White Wolf Editors

Kryptonite weapons are [pcol(very)] hard to come by on City of Hope. While the materials themselves (silver) might be very common, the purity and quality of weapons/ammunition made of these materials is rarely such that supplies the desired agg. Staff will be fairly liberal about allowing such weapons and ammunition where it can [pcol(only)] be used on NPCs in a specific PRP/TP. Requests for full-strength kryptonite for use on PCs will probably be denied.

For RP purposes, most of these materials as found in everyday items will have little effect on PCs. Players are encouraged to play out some level of trepidation and discomfort handling common kryptonite items and have reactions up to severe rashes from handling them, if desired. Changelings are free to use an iron railing to climb stairs, Werewolves can pick up a silver locket (but shouldn't wear it). Vampires are still incinerated by sunlight; sorry, there is no depleted sunlight.

Supernaturals have relatively few weaknesses and as such, they take those weaknesses very seriously. Brandishing Kryptonite in a threatening manner, in combat, automatically promotes the wielder to Risk Level 3 for the duration of combat. This is regardless of either player's level of sphere-specific Lore. For this to be the case, however, the kryptonite must be the appropriate type for the character's real race. If you're a Gangrel posing miraculously well as a werewolf and someone pulls a silver dagger on you, they aren't automatically promoted to Risk Level 3.

For vampires holy water, garlic, and crosses are not considered Kryptonite but stakes and fire are. Fire is not considered Kryptonite for anyone else.

& Maelstrom
& The Maelstrom
& week of nightmares
[header(The Maelstrom)]
The Maelstrom (aka, The Week of Nightmares) was a major event in oWoD canon that forever changed the world. It marked the entrance of Demons to the world and made the Umbra toxic to just about everyone.

However, we [pcol(liked)] things the way they were and would rather The Maelstrom never happened. But that means no Demons! We've chosen a compromise regarding The Maelstrom:

 * It did happen
 * It had little to no effect on Prospect
 * Demons escaped (obviously)
 * Ravnos is still dead (...or is he?!?!)
    * Plenty of Ravnos survived - enough that it's not a big deal to see one or be one
        * But oh man was shit scary for a while
 * The Umbra returned to normal in most places (including Prospect)
[footer()]

& Authority
& Status Stats
[header(Status Stats and Authority)]
Certain stats (usually backgrounds) are intended to represent a character's standing in their own society. These stats include but are not limited to: Status (Vampire), Pure Breed (Werewolf), Title (Changeling), and Eminence (Demon). These stats work well in table top where a storyteller is omniscient and can manage the implications. MUs are not such an environment.

Even in table top, Status only carries weight amongst those who respect it. The Brujah or Bone Gnawers with no status have no incentive to respect the status of others; they're unlikely to get any themselves so playing the status game is unlikely to pay off for them. In short, Status is something respected by those who have, or want to gain Status.

Those same Brujah and Bone Gnawers will, however, respect the [pcol(authority)] of others within their sphere. Authority is delegated from the top down, not merely assumed. Authority can be assumed when there is no established structure, but assumed authority is not automatic; it must be defended, possibly through force.

Some Status stats can modify dice rolls. Those effects are by the book, regardless of the above interpretations.

& shifter rank
[header(Shifter Rank Requirements)]
For a shifter to advance in rank we impose a minimum amount of time in the current rank in addition to the renown requirement:
  * Cub concept -> Rank 1: No time requirement
  * Rank 1 -> Rank 2: 1 Month
  * Rank 2 -> Rank 3: 3 Months
  * Rank 3 -> Rank 4: 6 Months
  * Rank 4 -> Rank 5: 8 Months

By this chart, the fastest any shifter can advance from Rank 1 to Rank 5 is 18 months.
[footer()]

& Blood Bonds
[header(Blood Bonds)]
Blood bonding a PC requires the vampire to directly provide the blood to a specific victim. There are no mass or accidental blood bonds. The Vampire must be physically present to blood bond a victim.

Blood bonds range from 1 to 3. Initiating and increasing a blood bond requires a drop of blood and each must be administered on separate nights. A blood bond provides no powers or ability: just emotional attachment.
  * A level 1 bond inspires friendliness. The victim will look upon you favorably and hear what you have to say. They might want to hang out in the future but they're not going to go out of their way for you. If you act creepy, a level 1 bond is not going to compel someone to get into your car.
  * A level 2 bond inspires strong positive feelings. The victim would want to date you if it were an option. Like an ally, they're willing to occasionally accept a moderate inconvenience for your benefit. They still have their own life and responsibilities and they won't drop everything for you. They think of you often and look forward to seeing you.
  * A level 3 bond inspires obsession. The victim has great difficulty not thinking about you. They will take risks with their responsibilities to make you happy. If shunned, they will likely have an extreme reaction ranging from despondency to violence. Long-standing level 3 bonds in a negative relationship have resulted in the suicide of the victim and/or the final death of the vampire.

[pcol(A cautionary note to vampires:)] A level 2 blood bond can get awkward and a level 3 bond can easily become problematic. Level 2 and 3 bonds force the victim to perceive you as playing an important role in their life. People talk about those that play important roles in their lives. When you blood bond someone, ensure you know who their friends are and that those friends won't come back to haunt you.

& Public
& In Public
[header(In Public)]
Prospect is a city of millions and all those people have to be somewhere. Everywhere you go there will be citizens doing their things. What follows are guidelines to determine whether or not there are people at your location:
  * If you're in the Deep Forest, [pcol(+dice 1)]. If you get 1, there's at least one person somewhere nearby. If you get anything else, there's no one around (probably).
  * If you're in the Desert, roll as if in the Deep Forest.
  * If you're in the Deep Ocean, roll as if in the Deep Forest.
  * If you're in a private space behind a locked door, there's no one around (probably).
  * If your location is not in the above list, there are people around. This includes alleys (bums), parks (joggers, dog walkers, rapists), and the beach (more rapists).

Furthermore, if you're in a place that would reasonably be crowded such as a club, it [pcol(is)] crowded. Crowds make it difficult to hear people, notice people, and find people. If there would reasonably be loud music playing, there [pcol(is)] loud music playing.

& Magical Items
[header(Magical Items)]
Magical items are items that capture some sort of magical ability. This includes Fetishes, Treasures, Wonders, Devices, Demon Relics, Wraith Artifacts, Sorcerer-Psychic Enchantments, and items enchanted through vampiric magic. This does [pcol(not)] include Talens, products of Alchemy, and other single-use items.

[center(argcol(NOT OFFICIAL),78)]
  [pcol(Discrepancy:)] - Temp Pathos fluctuations, Perm Pathos is 10. Pathos is probably wrong for Wraiths/Risen
  [pcol(Discrepancy:)] - For Technocracy folks, Hypertech probably makes more sense than occult for crafting/procurement

[pcol(Creation)]
 - Magical items must be spelled out in a book (like a Fetish) or capture a specific power: Wayfare:2, Obfuscate:1, Lore of Tongues:3, and run by those mechanics
   - Some items will require conversion: a gift that requires gnosis may cost Glamour as a Treasure
 - The level of the item is sum of the levels of power captured (or the level of the Fetish, etc)
   - A magical item that captures Potence:2 is a level 2 item.
   - A magical item that captures Celerity:1 and has a level 2 ward on it is a level 3 item.
 - Items are categorized by Genre: Mage: the Ascension, Werewolf: the Apocalypse, Demon: the Fallen, etc.
 - To craft an item that captures a power from an different genre, the creator must have the appropriate lore at 3.
   - A Sorcerer-Psychic trying to capture a shifter Gift would need Lore Garou:3 or Lore Fera:3, depending on the gift.
   - A bastet creating a Fetish that captures a Sorcerer-Psychic path would need Lore Sorcerer-Psychic:3
 - The rate at which magical items can be created is limited by the notion of "tokens":
   - Your number of tokens is Occult x 2 (Rituals x 2 for Shifters, Gremayre x 2 for Changelings)
   - Creating a level 5 item consumes 5 tokens
   - Those 5 tokens return in 30 days.
   - Tokens are only consumed on successful creation
   - We'd prefer to agree on a standard result and waive the [pcol(+roll)].
   - Example: Sponge's occult is 4 so he has 8 tokens. He crafts a level 5 item, consuming 5 tokens. This leaves 3 tokens. Sponge can make another item that's level 3 or less. If
he waits 30 days, the 5 tokens he spent will return and he can make something larger.

[pcol(Carrying and Use)]
 - Characters are limited by how many magical items they can bring into a scene.
   - Characters can have dumpsters full of magical items at home.
 - The limit is on the sum of the item levels:
   - If I'm carrying a level 2 item and a level 3, I'm carrying 5 points of items.
   - If I'm carrying three level 1 items, I'm carrying 3 points of items.
 - A character's magical carrying limit is:
   - Shifters: (Rank + Rituals) x 2
   - Changelings: (Highest Art + Gremayre) x 2
   - Demons: (Faith (max 5) + Occult) x 2
   - Mage: (Arete + Occult) x 2
   - Mortals, Ghouls, Subrace:Kinfolk, Subrace:Kinain, Subrace:Possessed: Occult x 2
   - Sorcerer-Psychic: (Highest Path + Occult) x 2
   - Vampires: Highest vamp magic + Occult
     - This is not x 2. Magical items are uncommon for Vampires
   - Wraith/Risen: (Pathos (max 5) + Occult) x 2
 - To use an out-of-genre magical item the character must meet the requirements of the item/power captured (Willpower, Gnosis, Glamour) and have Occult (Rituals for shifters, Gremayre for Changelings) greater than or equal to the item level
   - A Garou using a level 2 Treasure must have Rituals:2 or higher
     - A Garou using a Fetish need only meet the requirements of the Fetish
   - A Changeling using a level 3 enchanted stick must have Occult:3 or higher
     - A Changeling using a Treasure need only meet the requirements of the Treasure
   - All magical items are considered out-of-genre for Mortals, Ghouls, Subrace:Kinfolk, Subrace:Kinain, and Subrace:Possessed
 - Receiving a magical item made by another player does [pcol(not)] require purchasing the appropriate background
   - If a Changeling makes a level 2 Treasure for Sponge, Sponge does [pcol(not)] have to spend the XP for Treasure:2

The purpose of these rules is to make it easier for staff and players to reason about magical items and how they should be used. They are not completely consistent with the book,
nor are they intended to be.

& Awareness
[header(Awareness)]
[pcol(When can you roll Awareness?)]
 * Each player with Awareness can roll Awareness once per effect.
 * Awareness itself is not a power and can not be sensed by Awareness or other powers.
 * Awareness can only be rolled when an effect has activated.
  * Example: A standing rote that deflects flying anvils does not grant an awareness check. When that same rote actually deflects an anvil, it grants an awareness check.
 * To roll Awareness, the player must be in the same room as the source or victim of the effect.

[pcol(Difficulties)]
 * [argcol(Diff 4)] - Level 5 power
 * [argcol(Diff 6)] - Level 4 power
 * [argcol(Diff 7)] - Level 3 power
 * [argcol(Diff 9)] - Level 2 power
 * [argcol(Diff 10)] - Level 1 power
 * Detecting powers used for sensing are at a +1 difficulty.
 * Detecting powers used for influencing are at a -1 difficulty.

[pcol(Degrees of Success)]
 * [argcol(1 Success)] - Gives the player a sense that 'something' has happened, but not what/where/degree of effect.
 * [argcol(2 Successes)] - The player knows what happened, but not where/degree of effect.
   Examples:
    * Sponge's mind has been influenced.
    * My keys have suddenly gone missing.
    * Somebody is here that wasn't here before.
 * [argcol(3 Successes)] - Player knows what happened/location of the source/and degree of effect.
   * The accuracy of the location of the source would be equivalent to pointing one's finger at the source. In a crowded room, the individual rolling Awareness gets a general direction of where the source is. (See [pcol(+rules In Public)]).
 * [argcol(4 Successes)] - Player knows what/where/degree of effect and some extra insight into the power used.
   * Person rolling Awareness learns the general direction and rough distance of the source.
     Example extra insight: 
      * Discovering the "vehicle" of the power: Touch, Eye Contact, Words, etc.
    * Players can agree on a different insight.
    * If players can't agree on a different insight, "vehicle" is the default insight.
 * [argcol(5 or More Successes)] - Player knows what/where/degree of effect and has a full understanding of the result. This is not the same as understanding the power itself.
    * The attention of the character rolling Awareness is immediately drawn to the exact source.

Understanding the nature of powers requires the appropriate Lore at 3.
 * e.g. "Sponge's mind has been influenced" vs. "Sponge's mind has been influenced by a vampire using Dominate"

& ability aptitude
[header(Ability Aptitude and similar merits)]
Merits that reduce the difficulty of an ability roll (such as Ability
Aptitude) [pcol(do not apply)] to supernatural powers using that ability roll,
[pcol(unless)] the merit specifically says that it does.

Examples:

* A demon uses Lore of the Forge (Perception + Crafts) to improve a car. If the
  demon has Ability Aptitude: Crafts, then it doesn't apply in that situation.

* The above demon succeeded anyway, the car now gives -1 difficulty to Drive
  rolls. A ratkin steals the car and gets into a high-speed chase (Dexterity or
  Wits + Drive). If the ratkin has Ability Aptitude: Drive, then it does
  apply, and stacks with the car's bonus. (It's not affecting a power, just the
  side effect of a power.)

* A mage has the Natural Channel merit, which includes "difficulty to use magic
  to pierce the Gauntlet is one less". This applies as stated.

* Acute Sense (VtM Revised page 296) says "This Merit can be combined with the
  Discipline Auspex to produce superhuman sensory acuity." This also applies as
  stated. In particular, Aura Perception (Auspex 2) is specifically visual, so
  Acute Vision applies to it.

* Awareness is not a power, it just detects powers, so Ability Aptitude:
  Awareness is allowed. However, Awareness is not consistently tied to any of
  the five senses like Auspex 2 is, so the Acute Sense merits don't apply to
  Awareness.

& totem
& jamak
& nushi
[header(Totem / Jamak / Nushi)]
* Totem is limited to 5 dots during chargen, 10 dots afterward
  - If you want to start with a 6+ Totem, you need at least one packmate

* Buying Totem / Jamak / Nushi with XP costs 2 per dot, regardless of level (WW3801/123)

* Totem powers come from:
  - A specific totem named in a book (e.g. WtA Revised pages 294-298)
    - or from http://garoumush.wikia.com/wiki/Totems with staff approval
    - no other custom totems
  - Construction kit (WtA Revised page 123)

* Totem, Numen, and Familiar Spirit may all be bought by individual PCs

* Fera may contribute to a pack totem (WW3807/163)

& possessed
[header(Possessed)]
* We don't allow PCs to reduce permanent Autonomy below 4.
* Kami do not have Autonomy. For the purpose of die rolls involving Autonomy (e.g. Spirit Kinship, Fading, Urges), we treat kami as if they have permanent Autonomy of 6.
* Some powers and taints from Freak Legion are available to non-fomori:
  - Disintegration, Limited Mobility, and Special Diet are available to gorgons and kami.
  - Inner Volcano is available to kami with a suitable spirit.
* Disallowed powers: Brain Eating, Balefire Flux
* Adjusted powers
  - Savage Genitalia: Lethal, soakable if you can soak lethal in general. Armor does not apply.
  - Electrical Field, Poison: Damage dice, not automatic damage levels.
  - Enhanced Attribute, Exoskeleton, Unnatural Strength: Maximum 8 extra attribute dots from any combination of these powers.
  - If a power or taint requires Appearance 0, then the Hidden Power merit does not override that.
* If a possessed has Rage (from the Berserker power) and is also a ghoul, they make frenzy rolls for both Rage and Self-Control. If a situation applies to both, they frenzy if either roll fails.
* The spirit part of a possessed is immune to blood bonding. The lower their Autonomy, the more influential the spirit part is.

Quintessence cannot be stockpiled, except by transferring it into an object (creating Tass) or mage or periapt. Tass may be stockpiled up to three months.

Creating or increasing the power of a node requires Prime 5.

Large nodes (4+) are subject to staff discretion. A mage's Node background may correspond to two or more smaller nodes, but they won't be right next door to each other; consider how much territory you can reliably defend.

& kuei-jin
[header(Kuei-jin)]
* We don't use Martial Arts. Use Brawl and pretend.
* Dharma Rating
  - Requires time (same minimums as '+rules shifter rank') and XP (current*4) in addition to Auspicious Occasion rolls
  - Capped at 5 (KotE page 13 compares 6+ to 7th/lower generation)
* Nushi: Works like Totem, see '+rules nushi'
* Do Kuei-Jin smell of the Wyrm: KotE Companion page 125: "Kuei-jin usually detect as Wyrm-tainted to the senses of the Lupines - but not always. In particular, the Thrashing Dragon Dharma often seems to radiate Wyld energy, and the Resplendent Crane Dharma Weaver energy. However, almost all Kuei-jin (except those of great enlightenment - Dharma 7+) have at least a subtle hint of Wyrm taint. Naturally, this can be accelerated by the actions of the Kuei-Jin in question - a Cathayan who indulges in flesh eating very likely smacks of the stench of the Defiler."
