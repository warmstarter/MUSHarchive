[header(mudname() Policies)]
Policies are the rules that players and staff are required to abide by. They do [ansi(h,not)] dictate the conduct of characters, just the individuals driving those chars. No one is exempt from these rules and violations of these rules will be dealt with according to the severity of the infraction.

Policy topics accessible with '+policy <topic>' are as follows:

& mission statement
[header(Mission Statement)]
These are the principles that we think a game should be based on. These ideas
are the basis for our rules and policies. These ideas tell us whether or not
a change goes against the spirit of the Mush.

 - To protect everyone, staff and players will have rules that they will have to abide by.
 - Staff and players should be treated as equals and with respect.
 - Staff and players should be fair and impartial in all aspects of the game.
 - A staff member's or player's personal life is not the business of the Mush.
 - Standards should be in place to ensure effective communication for players and staff.
 - The game should create an environment that is friendly to all.
 - Staffers should be competent in the areas they are assigned to.
 - Staffers need to contribute to an effective presence in their area of responsibility.
 - Staffers should put equal effort into every player they are responsible for.
 - Between staffers, professionalism takes precedence over friendship.
 - No player should give or receive an advantage that they did not acquire through role play.
 - Players have the right to refuse to be a part of a storyline that they didn't involve themselves in.
 - By choosing to take part in a storyline, players accept some responsibility for that storyline.
 - Chargen should be thorough, but easy and swift.
 - Nothing well justified should be rejected for a character.
 - It should be easy for players to find role play.
 - Experience should be awarded for experiences, not just successes.
 - Documentation should be informative, up to date, easy to follow and easy to find.
 - Code should fill the requirements of the game.
 - Code should be well documented and easy to use.
 - The grid should be attractive and conducive to role play.
 - Decisions should be transparent. Where it doesn't violate personal privacy or storyline, staff are required to explain decisions to players and other staff when asked, and players are required to explain their decisions to staff when asked. Players are never required to explain their decisions to other players.

& posing
[header(Posing)]
Power Posing
   Power posing is posing the actions of others without their OOC consent. Because this is a form of one player forcing their will on another, we do not accept power posing.

Meta Posing
   Meta posing is posing information about your character that other characters might not be able to perceive, such as emotional state, or memories. Some frown on meta posing because they feel that they should only see what their character sees. Some celebrate meta posing because it allows others the chance to decide what their character picks up on without the need for roll after roll. Because of the varied opinions on meta posing and because the extra information can just be ignored, we neither endorse nor discourage meta posing.
[footer()]
& time
[header(Time)]
Time Ratio
   Some MU*s utilize compressed time, where time happens faster on the MU than in real life. Some MU*s utilize expanded time, where time happens slower on the MU than in real life. [mudname()] does not utilize time compression or expansion: it runs in real time. We feel that whatever time ratio we choose, it will never match the pace that people RP at. We chose real time because, if we can't make time run at the same pace as RP, we'll at least make it easy to schedule things.

Away Time
   There is no correct assumption about what a character has been doing while the player was away from the game. If someone does not log into the game for a week, it doesn't mean they've gone missing, it just means you haven't run into them. The safest assumption is that they've been busy, but everything is normal. This includes server outages. If the server is down for three hours, when it comes back up, game time is three hours later.
[footer()]

& common sense
[header(Common Sense)]
   Staff are strongly encouraged to treat each character as if they have a
version of the merit Common Sense. If a staffer sees a player about to do
something that defies common sense thinking, they are encouraged to advise the
player that whatever the character is about to do is a bad idea.
   Players are in no way obligated to follow "Common Sense" advice from staff.  However, if the player elects not to follow the advice and the consequences are dire, the staffer is less likely to be sympathetic. Players are encouraged to ignore "Common Sense" advice if it would not be appropriate for their character's concept, mental state, or other circumstances.
   Staff are not obligated to give out "Common Sense" advice. Staffers may forget, not realize the situation, or simply not feel like it. Conversely, staff is prohibited from encouraging bad decisions. Staff is not responsible for a character making good or bad decisions.
[footer()]

& policies
[header(Policies)]
   [mudname()] may need to add, change, or remove policies from the MU.  Because such changes will only be made as needed, rather than at whims, there are no Grandfather Clauses for policies. In turn, because there are no Grandfather Clauses, policy changes will not be made without serious thought about how the change will affect players.
   Policies changes should not be confused with rules changes and precedents. By default rules changes and precedents do not have Grandfather Clauses, but a specific change or precedent may recognize the Grandfather Clause.

& rules changes
[header(Rules Changes)]
   Although [mudname()] intends to follow White Wolf canon, in some few instances we may feel that a particular rule or storyline aspect does not fit with the rest of the World of Darkness. To make things fit together better, we will make changes to the rules, setting, or storyline. These changes are listed in the +rules system, and when a rules change is made, it will be announced on the Public Policies bulletin board.
   When a rule change is made, there is no Grandfather Clause unless it is stated in the +rule system.

See Also: Precedents
[footer()]

& precedents
[header(Precedents)]
   Occasionally, certain rules or aspects of the setting or storyline are vague or contradictory as stated by the book. When such confusion arises, a staffer running the scene is to make an on the spot decision to clear up the confusion and keep the scene going. Afterward, staffers must discuss the confusion and agree on one interpretation. Whatever interpretation is decided on becomes a "Precedent": how the rules should be interpreted from then on. The outcomes of any previous scenes stay the same, regardless of the precedent. 
   When new precedents are set, they are noted in the +rule system and announced on the Public Policies bulletin board.

& security
[header(Security)]
   This MUSH, it's website, and other services all reside on Sponge's personal server on his private network. Bringing weaknesses in any aspect of this system to Sponge's attention will be rewarded. Any attempts to subvert this system will be dealt with swiftly and possibly without warning.
   Attempts to subvert this system include but are not limited to:
   
     - Use of soft code to gain information that should be gained ICly, use
       of soft code to gain privileges not administratively granted, use of
       soft code to disrupt the activity of the MUSH
     - Use of known or predicted vulnerabilities in TinyMUX, Apache, or other
       software in use on these systems or on the website.
     - Denial of Service attacks, distributed or otherwise, including but not
       limited to: traffic flooding, SYN flooding, RST attacks, fragmented
       packet attacks (Teardrop, etc), email flooding, and activity intended
       to consume excessive CPU time, memory, bandwidth, or storage
     - Forging of IP datagrams, email, instant messages, web posts, or other
       traffic such that it appears to come from this network
     - Other activities deemed disruptive to our network and systems.

   Corrective action for these activities varies in accordance with the severity of the actions and can range from a simple warning to blocking at the firewall and contact with the offender's ISP.
   In summary, do not attack us. If you think you can slip it by us, +finger sponge and read carefully.

& Learning
[header(Learning)]
Here on City of Hope we do not require learning times for xp spends. Staff feels that if a player earns the experience then they should be able to spend it where and how they like within the confines of the rules of the game.
[footer()]

& CA Laws
[header(CA Laws)]
The state of California has several laws that may be different from other states within the U.S. because of this we here at City of Hope have listed some of the more basic laws that will affect the world /IC/. Take note that this is a World of Darkness and just because the laws are in place does not necessarily mean that they will be strictly enforced in all areas or even obeyed by all people. This is a dark, Gothic punk world and these are dark times. Bad things can and will happen. No player or staff member is expected to adhere to these /IC/ laws, /OOC/ rules, laws and policies is a completely different matter and all players and staff are expected to adhere to such. As a side note, some of the /IC/ laws listed below have been modified to reflect the World of Darkness based theme for California state.

   - The legal driving age in California is 16.
   - The legal age of sexual consent is 18.
   - The legal adult age in California is 18.
   - The legal drinking age in California is 21.
   - The legal gambling age in California is 18.
   - The legal age to buy cigarettes/cigars in California is 18.
   - The legal age to start work in California is 16.
   - Blades longer than 4" are illegal to carry in public.
     - Adjust for common sense with kitchen knives and longer blades in cases.

& arbitration
[header(Arbitration)]
When any number of people get together there is always friction and disagreement. Sometimes the disagreeing parties cannot come to an agreement for any number of reasons. For these situations, Sponge and Rabbit can act as an arbitrator to get things resolved in a fashion as mutually agreeable as possible.

Sponge is here to write code and help keep the game running smoothly, not to RP, make friends, or fulfill some need for power. Rabbit is here as well to help keep the game running smoothly, not to make friends, or fulfill some great need for power. Because of this, Sponge and Rabbit will not show preferential treatment to any player or staffer and will work toward what they believe will best benefit the game as a whole. Sponge and Rabbit will maintain confidentiality as requested and will not divulge information about one of the parties in a way other than what was agreed upon by Sponge or Rabbit and the respective person.

If any player or staffer has an issue with another player or staffer and feels that it can't be worked out directly, then Sponge or Rabbit should be contacted by @mail. Please keep in mind that Sponge works full time, so although he will be fair, impartial, and thorough, he won't necessarily be prompt.

& the pc
[header(The PC)]
When someone makes a PC character that character in definition has a mind, body and spirit of it's own, it's very own identity, and hopefully remains three-dimensional in personality. The player character is a special character differentiated in the game from NPC's because the /player/ has control over themselves rather than the staffers and are unique in their own ways whereas NPC's tend to be driven towards a direct goal for a plot line on behalf of a Storyteller.

Therefore it is NOT necessary to follow the status quo when making a PC and here on City of Hope. We look forward to those players that seek out individuality and uniqueness in their character, though also, we do not mind those who wish to stick to stereotypes: these can still be fun to play. It is against MU policy for anyone on City of Hope to hinder a player for OOC reasons, such as one's feelings about another's concept.
[footer()]

& idling
[header(Idling)]
[pcol(Idling on grid is not a crime!)]

Players are given XP periodically just for being IC. We determine IC and OOC by your location: if you're on the grid, you're IC, if you're off the grid, you're OOC. The names of OOC Rooms are all colored a luxurious [ansi(m,purple)] to be easy to recognize.

A common concern is that a player is on grid to soak up XP and not to RP. While this does happen, we prefer to trust players by default.

Here are our [pcol(IC idling guidelines)]:
  * Being IC to wait for RP with specific people is fine, in public or private places.
  * If you're waiting for RP but not with specific people we prefer you hang out in public but don't require it.

We also offer an OOC Tavern called Poser's which features [pcol(private)] OOC rooms where players can idle as long as they wish, although NO RP is to be allowed there.
[footer()]

& unapproved
[header(Unapproved)]
To save space on the database as well as give other new players the chance to create characters without names being 'tied up', City of Hope has instituted an Unapproved policy where a player that is unapproved and hasn't logged in for a month will be destroyed. To prevent an unapproved character from being destroyed, simply log in once or twice a month. At City of Hope we understand that it may take time to create a character or write up a background and that RL can get in the way. If something comes up and more time than a month is needed, please inform Sponge or Coyote through @mail ASAP and we will get back to you as soon as possible and see to it that your time is extended so that you don't lose your work in progress.

& inactive pcs
& vacation
& inactive characters
[header(Inactive PCs)]
Here at City of Hope we realize that players and Staff will often have RL issues come up in which they will need some time away from the MU. Should a player need to take an OOC absence they should try to supply an IC reason for the absence. If one isn't provided, other players should make assumptions as specified in the 'Time' policy.

To reduce database clutter and free up names, inactive PCs may be deleted according to the following criteria:

[pcol(Unstarted PCs)]
A PC is considered [pcol(unstarted)] if it has not logged in in longer than [argcol(14 days)] and does not have a [argcol(Race)] set on its [pcol(+sheet)]. Unstarted PCs are @destroyed outright.

[pcol(Unfinished PCs)]
A PC is considered [pcol(unfinished)] if it started the character creation process (got [argcol(Race)] set on [pcol(+sheet)]), but has not logged in greater than [argcol(30 days)] and has not been approved. Unfinished PCs are @destroyed outright.

[pcol(Unapproved PCs)]
A PC is considered [pcol(unapproved)] if it has at one time been approved for RP but that approval has since been removed. This may represent retirement or a player being removed from the game. Unapproved PCs are not currently @destroyed.

[pcol(Inactive PCs)]
A PC is considered [pcol(inactive)] if it is currently approved but has not logged in in greater than 90 days. Inactive PCs may lose properties leased through [pcol(+rent)] but no objects they own are taken, transferred or @destroyed. Their objects may be moved off-grid. Inactive PCs may be moved to a room called [ansi(m,The Fridge)] but may leave at any time when they return.

[pcol(Abandoned PCs)]
A PC is considered [pcol(abandoned)] if it is currently approved but has not logged in in greater than 180 days. Abandoned PCs may have properties taken off grid, transferred, or @destroyed but only on a case-by-case basis. Abandoned PCs are not currently @destroyed.

[pcol(Vacations)]
None of the above criteria apply to characters set [pcol(on vacation)]. A vacation may be declared for up to 90 days and may be renewed indefinitely.

& privacy
[header(Privacy)]
We at City of Hope respect the privacy of players and staff. We feel that having the personal security of knowing that you're not being eavesdropped on helps create a more comfortable environment. For this reason, only wizards have the ability to go dark. The only wizards on City of Hope are Coyote and Sponge.

City of Hope is run on a private server on a private network with local access only available to Coyote and Sponge. Only Sponge has the access to perform packet capture on the system and local network. There is ongoing recording of all player interaction with the MUSH. These records are kept indefinitely. These records are to be used only to troubleshoot technical problems with the MU, verify issues of harassment, and identify instances of cheating. To date it has been used to verify harassment, troubleshoot an issue with +vote, and investigate suspected spoofed command output. Also note: [pcol(the person hosting any game can see your password.)] [argcol(DON'T REUSE YOUR PASSWORDS!)]

The use of the DARK flag by wizards will be at the consent of those being monitored unless there is evidence of OOC harassment or abuse. Packet capture will only be employed for serious incidents.

These limitations of monitoring capability grant players quite a bit of freedom. It is common practice on many MUs for staff to go DARK to avoid contact with players. We do not allow this so, in exchange for the extra privacy, players are expected to honor a staff member's Off-Duty status.

Also, use of the Unfindable flag is [pcol(not)] restricted for players. Players are welcome to use the Unfindable flag as they see fit. Staff can still see the location of Unfindable players.

& risk
& risk intro
[header(Risk System Introduction)]
On many MUs, it is not uncommon to be killed, maimed, permanently altered, or otherwise taken out of play for what amounts to no good reason. Maybe someone's having a bad day and the polka dots on your socks are the final straw. While staff agrees that this is a World of Darkness and bad things happen to good people for no reason all the time, that kind of 'realism' shouldn't detract from the fun of the game.

The risk system system is intended to limit the level at which a player can be made to suffer for things they didn't initiate. Players assign themselves a Risk Level which represents the level of permanent effects they consent to and limits the level of permanent effects they can inflict upon others. Those effects outside a player's Risk Level are cinematic: the player accepts them for the duration of the scene (or potentially longer) but is not stuck with them when the appropriate duration has elapsed.

The system's focus is combat and direct conflict. A player's risk level can protect them when attacked or when they come under the force of another's will. A players risk level will not protect them from the reasonable consequences of reckless actions: disclosing others' secrets, breaking sect laws, sabotage, etc. You shouldn't have to worry about roving bands of PK maniacs; you should worry about how your own actions may come back to haunt you.

& risk system 
[header(Risk System)]
[mudname()] uses a novel [pcol(Risk System)] to allow players to control their exposure to risk of permanent changes to their character.

There are two types of ramifications in the Risk System: [argcol(Real)] and [argcol(Cinematic)].
  * [argcol(Real)] effects are exactly how they sound. They make actual changes to the character(s).
  * [argcol(Cinematic)] effects last for the scene, then afterward only as long as the player wishes to RP them out.

The distinction is key to understanding the implications of each Risk Level.

At the [argcol(Lowest)] level of risk characters are permanently affected at their own discretion and likewise the permanent effects they cause are at the discretion of the recipient. This is not the same as fair-escape and doesn't mean a player can refuse effects placed on them fairly. This is explained in greater detail starting with the [pcol(risk 0)] policy page.

At the [argcol(Highest)] level of risk players automatically consent to potentially severe, and permanent changes to their character(s) from other high-risk characters, including death.

When two players RP, they automatically accept the permanent effects as determined by the [pcol(lower)] of their risk levels.

[pcol(NOTE:)] Some locations make the character(s) a certain risk level just by their presence. Such locations will always provide an obvious warning in the desc of the room.

The Risk system provides rules about what actions players consent to automatically and how that's communicated to other players.

& risk 0 
[header(Risk 0)]
Description: There are no permanent changes to the player's character(s) without the player's consent. Risk Level 0 is purely cinematic.

You can get into fights, be attacked, get beat up, pick fights with others, and be the victim of powers, but the effects are restricted entirely to RP. Broken bones, bruises, wounds, and injured pride persist only for the duration of the scene then afterward only as long as the player wants to RP them.

In summary, Risk Level 0 characters can be subject to situations the player doesn't want, but the player decides what the permanent effects to their character(s) are. Resolving Risk 0 conflicts may require hand-waving.

Continued in: Risk 1
See Also: Hand Waving
[footer()]

& risk 1 
[header(Risk 1)]
Description: At Risk Level 1 the player automatically consents to the permanent effects of dice rolls, and damage. The player also consents to imprisonment and incapacitation for the duration of the scene. 

Characters can't be permanently wounded, or killed without the player's consent. Characters can't take damage beyond incapacitated. At the end of the scene any permanent effects become cinematic.

Players can still accept any permanent affects they consent to for any duration.

Resolving Risk 1 conflicts may require hand-waving.

Continued in: Risk 2
See Also: Hand Waving
[footer()]

& risk 2
[header(Risk 2)]
Description: The player automatically consents to all permanent effects excluding death or being taken out of play for longer then one week. At this level effects on the character are to be considered real as opposed to cinematic.

Players can still participate in anything they consent to for any duration.

Returning to play after being removed may require hand waving.

Continued in: Risk 3
See Also: Hand Waving
[footer()]

& risk 3
[header(Risk 3)]
Description: The player automatically consents to all effects including death, and being taken out of play for up to one month. After one month the player is entitled to have their character(s) released, or to know that their character(s) will be permanently unplayable. At this level effects on the character are to be considered real as opposed to cinematic.

Players can still participate in anything they consent to for any duration.

& hand waving
[header(Hand Waving)]
Staff on City of Hope feel that rules and consistency are important for balance in a game, however they shouldn't always get in the way of fun RP. When the most enjoyable outcome may be inconsistent with rules, theme, or storyline hand waving may be in order.

With hand waving players agree amongst themselves how a situation gets resolved without worrying about all the details. For example, two characters get into a fight. Neither is trying to seriously injure the other. They can decide for themselves who will win; they can reduce the combat to just a few dice rolls; or they can just rp the scene out, and agree upon an outcome. As long as everyone agrees the details aren't important.

Another common example is where the content of a scene is unpalatable to one or more participants. While everyone might consent to the situation and an inevitable outcome, the subject matter may be unenjoyable to play out. This is commonly called Fade To Black (FTB). No one should be forced to RP out a scene that everyone agrees is tedious or makes one of the players uncomfortable. In these situations, players are encouraged to discuss the scene out of character and come to an agreement, without having to RP it out.

While encouraged, hand waving has its limits. First and foremost, hand waving requires that all the participants agree. If agreement isn't met, a scene should be run according to rules, setting, and theme. If players can't agree on that they should seek Arbitration. Second, hand waving should never give any player an advantage that lasts longer than the scene or affects characters that weren't present. Lastly, hand waving can't be used to permanently alter the overarching story or setting; hand waving can't kill the NPC mayor or blow up the police station.

& changing risk
[header(Changing Risk)]
Players can change their character's Risk Level anytime they're not in combat. Once combat begins a character's Risk Level can't be changed by anyone. Damage, wounds, and other long-lasting effects gained at a certain Risk Level do not become cinematic when the player sets their character(s) to a lower Risk Level.

See Also: Risk System   Risk Zones   Risk Abuse
[footer()]

& risk zones
[header(Risk Zones)]
A Risk Zone is a location that forces some or all characters present to be at a specific risk level for the purpose of protecting that location.

Because a Risk Zone forces a character(s) to be at a specific risk level Risk Zones are only established by staff. When a Risk Zone is requested staff will evaluate the request, determine who it will apply to, and ensure that the risk level is properly indicated. Characters who enter a Risk Zone who do not want to be at that risk level should leave immediately. Characters can't be forced into any Risk Zone no matter what the level of the Risk Zone is.

For OOC purposes the description of a Risk Zone will include an OOC warning of the risk level. The description must also include elements that would cause any sensible person to feel a sense of danger. 

If a scene that took place in a Risk Zone later requires judgment, staff will look for an OOC warning by the participants of that location's risk level.

[footer()]

& risk abuse
[header(Risk Abuse)]
The Risk System was designed to enable players to participate in scenes and situations they might normally not be comfortable with. The system is not intended to enable players to escape the repercussions of their actions. The characters exist in a world of darkness with no special protection. Players are expected to drive their character(s) in ways that are realistic for the world of darkness.

Examples of abuse are the following:

- Using lower risk level to escape the repercussions of actions that would put your life at risk in the world of darkness such as:

  * Violating the territory of another race or faction.
  * Disclosing supernatural secrets about others.
  * Breaking the laws of one's own faction.

- Taking actions to manipulate another character's risk level such as:

  * Leading/forcing them to a risk zone.
  * Coercing someone OOC to change their risk level.

Players who RP out the unfavorable results of higher risk level actions with grace and maturity will be looked upon positively by staff.

& PRPs
[header(Player Run Plots)]
PRPs allow players to act as storytellers in a limited capacity, running scenes and stories hopefully without the need for staff intervention. Players running PRPs can incorporate NPCs to drive the story and get people involved in ways they might not normally be involved.

Approval:
  * If you're planning a PrP that is self-contained, involving no NPCs that exist outside the PRP, making no changes to the world outside the PRP, it is automatically approved.
  * You'll need staff approval if you intend to run a PRP that:
      * Permanently affects the world, setting, or theme;
      * Utilizes sphere or key thematic NPCs (the Prince, the Hive Alpha, the mayor, established mob boss);
      * Overrides player risk levels;
      * Offers rewards to participants aside from votes/nominations/renown along the way.

Guidance:
  * Communication is your friend. Ensure your participants know what to expect from the PRP (combat time vs heavy social time vs light social time). IC surprises tend to be fun, OOC surprises tend to be less fun.
  * Planning is your second friend. You should have a rough idea of where the PRP is going and a rough idea of how players will get there.
  * But be flexible! Players will certainly deviate from what you think they'll do. Adapt and keep moving. If the players deviate but it's fun, consider whether or not you have room for a tangent.
  * Know how many slots you have available and what roles might be beneficial
  * Expect that some participants will have to leave before it's finished, and others might join partway through.
  * Ensure you understand the theme and mechanics of a given sphere before involving it.
  * To keep things manageable, plan for five or fewer participants.
  * Remember: you're volunteering to do this. If a participant is disrupting the PRP, remove them. If you are participating in someone else's PRP and you find that it's not a good fit for you, respectfully tell the PRP ST and remove yourself.
  * Playing your own character in a PRP can *potentially* represent a conflict of interest. To minimize that:
    * Minimize the dependence the other participants will have on your character.
    * Minimize the benefit your character stands to gain.
    * Ensure that your own character's gains are incidental to the PRP, not the objective.
  * Regardless of whether you play your own character or not, you may vote/nominate and [pcol(are)] eligible to receive the same.
  * Log everything. Having the log of what's happened so far can help in many unexpected ways.

(Probably Bad) PRP Ideas:
  * Bone Gnawer tribebook meets "The Hangover"
  * Eddie the Snitch has to go
  * Strange things are afoot at the 7-11
  * Why is this alley full of Iteration X transvestites?

Submitting PRP Ideas:
  Staff welcome your PRP ideas! Some players conceive, plan, and execute PRPs from beginning to end all on their own. This is great, but not everyone has that time or ability. Staff welcomes PRP ideas from players in any form. Submissions can range from a full-blown PRP down to a very brief summary. When ideas are submitted, staff would like to flesh them out as needed. If the original submitter would like to run it they are welcome to. If not, staff will look for a player who would like to run it. Ideas for open PRPs, sphere-specific PRPs, and cross-sphere PRPs are all welcome.

If you have a PRP idea to submit, please do so! (see [pcol(+help +pitch)])

& alts
[header(Alt Characters)]
  [pcol(Make Alts. Don't abuse alts.)]

Alt Rules:
  * Keep the knowledge and experiences of each character separate. If you must, maintain a notes file or notebook for each character to keep track of what each knows. This is a good practice outside of alts to keep track of what you know vs what your character knows.
  * Don't have alts in the same scene. If you find two of your characters in the same location, move one out.

Alt Guidelines:
  * Don't dilute yourself. Make only as many alts as you can manage.
  * Talk to staff if you want to have alts in same or opposing factions.
  * Keep the same SEMAIL across alts so Staff can more easily tell who's who.
[footer()]

& NPC Play
[header(NPC Play)]
For the purposes of PRPs and small player-run scenes, players can fill NPC slots with the following criteria:

 * The player must OOCly use an approved PC to represent the NPC.
 * The NPC must be an actual NPC. They cannot represent an approved PC.
 * A player must be invited to NPC a scene. They cannot don an NPC role and enter a scene without the permission of those present.
 * The player must temporarily stick 'NPC' in their name somewhere.
 * The NPC player [pcol(must)] be given direction about the role they're expected to play.
 * The NPC player may vote/nominate and [pcol(is)] eligible to receive the same. They're contributing to the story!
 * Players may NPC as a wraith's shadow! YAY eternal torment!

Spheres and other IC social groups need leadership. While staff needs to exert some amount of control over the spheres, they don't have the capacity to drive all the appropriate sphere NPCs. Even if they did, doing so would prevent great players from having the opportunity to shine.

Responsibility and authority can be bestowed upon someone, but leadership is a skill set which an individual must develop within themselves.

Leadership is:
  * Organizing your group around a collective goal.
  * Setting an example of excellence within your organization.
  * Motivating members of your group toward your collective goal.
  * Providing the support your members need to accomplish the collective goal.
  * Understanding and engaging the strengths of your group's members.
  * Inspiring your group to follow your lead.

Leadership is not:
  * Telling people what to do.
  * Having the final say.

To be selected for an IC position the player and character [pcol(both)] must display leadership. The player must initiate RP within their sphere, for the sphere and not just a subset of the sphere. The character must demonstrate leadership within their organization that would cause those already in power to take notice.

It's completely reasonable for a self-serving evil scumbag character to be a fantastic leader. If you make characters genuinely motivated to work for you and cause great RP to happen, your leadership will be self-evident.

Being a good leader is very challenging and very rewarding. Sponge is pleased to act as a mentor to anyone who wants to develop their leadership but isn't sure how.

[pcol(Sphere NPCs)]
While most spheres have NPCs written up in [pcol(news)], those NPCs are not intended for interaction with players. This has several implications.
 * It means that staff don't have to allocate time to RPing those NPCs.
 * It means that staff aren't directing RP within the sphere.
 * It keeps the power out of the hands of tyrants.
 * It ensures that PCs are prominent within a sphere by their own merit, not arbitrarily.
 * It means players have to assume that those sphere NPCs are doing the right things and it requires players to perform a certain amount of hand-waving for the sphere to work.

& xp transfer
[header(XP Transfer)]
There is no specific criteria for transfering XP from one character to another. The risk system allows players to control their own fate so PC death doesn't automatically imply compensation. In small amounts and limited cases, XP might be transfered from a character that is being permanently retired to another, established character. Any situations in which a transfer of XP may be appropriate are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. This includes Demon death, even when the demon will be transferred to a new host.

The exception to this policy is retiring a mortal. A player may, at any time, permanently retire a mortal character and have that character's lifetime XP transfered to a new supernatural character awaiting approval.

& communication
[header(Communication)]
Communication is critical for any socially-oriented game. BLAH BLAH BLAH

  * Out of character communication must be civil.
  * Communication must not include arguments ad hominem: Attacking an opponent's motives or character rather than the policy or position they maintain.
  * Offensive discussion should be moved from shared channels upon request, with the exception of the [pcol(Random)] channel.

& Harassment
[header(Harassment)]
For private communication to be considered harassment, all three of the following criteria must be met:
  * The recipient previously asked the sender to not contact them in that way
  * The communication is unsolicited
  * The communication is ongoing

For public communication (channels, +bb, etc) to be considered harassment, both of the following criteria must be met:
  * The communication must be clearly regarding a specific player
  * The communication must be clearly derogatory

The following are a few examples not considered harassment:
  * Dick insults Ruth directly. Dick is being a jerk. Ruth should avoid associating with Dick in the future and if the insults persist, Ruth should request that Dick not contact her in the future. If Dick continues, it becomes harassment.
  * Dick insults Ruth in private conversation with Whitney. Dick is being a jerk. Ruth and Whitney should probably avoid associating with Dick in the future. Dick is alienating other players and cutting off his own RP.

Harassment is taken very seriously on [mudname()]. In cases of clear harassment, the perpetrator is likely to receive severe punishment.

& wiki
[header(Wiki)]
Our wiki can be found at [pcol(http://www.cityofhopemush.com/wiki/)] and it's a great resource for players to share information.

It's important to note that the wiki is a player-maintained resource and has little to no staff oversight.

The canonical sources for policy and rules information are [pcol(+policy)] and [pcol(+rules)] respectively.

The canonical sources for chargen information are [ansi(hg,MTPDATW Chargen)] and the [ansi(m,Sphere Information Room)].

& audience
[header(Our Audience)]
City of Hope is a game of stories.

Our Mission Statement lays out how we work to create a suitable environment. Beyond that staff tries to stay out of the way; storytelling is the domain of the players, mediation is the domain of staff. We feel that when staff drives a realm of RP, the resulting stories tend to serve the staffer.

Game mechanics are present to facilitate storytelling but are subordinate to storytelling. The focus should be on the experience, not the outcome. Players are expected to coordinate out of character to establish the direction of a story. Game mechanics introduce detours and the chance of failure. Conflict and competition between characters is the necessary spice of the story. Conflict and competition between players is ultimately counterproductive.

We open our doors to anyone who can abide by our policies. Our chief concern is the ongoing suitability of the environment for storytelling. We do our best to keep that as the focus of our decision making: from individual player requests to the creation and audit of policies. We are human and thus are prone to error, inconsistency, and short-sightedness. We offer players patience and the benefit of the doubt and request the same.

In choosing to emphasize some aspects of a MUSH we must downplay or reject others. Each choice we make requires a sacrifice, making this game a great fit for some and unpalatable to others. We strive to provide a game where reasonable objectives are achievable. This favors goal-oriented, motivated players willing to build the world around them. Proactive players will find that their opportunities equal the effort they put into their respective spheres and RP at large.

& Post-traumatic mush disorder
& Post traumatic mush disorder
& PTMD
[header(Post-Traumatic MUSH Disorder)]
You're sitting in your haven, watching Monday Night Football in your underwear. The doorbell rings, so you go answer it. The visitor sees your face and then a flash of light from a suicide vest levels your house and turns you to ash.
- Someone knew where you lived.
- They didn't like your shoe color.
- They had Demolitions eleventy.
- They mind-raped some poor transient to pay you a visit.

You're sitting in your pack den, watching Monday Night Football in your underwear. All of sudden your Coors Lite seeps into your hand, turning it to silver. And then your forearm, arm, and body. You fall over writhing in agony until dead.
- You called the brooding Euthanatos a caern-raping namer.
- They knew were you lived.
- They used Mage Spheres of whatever to turn you to silver.

You're sitting in the Elysium, watching Monday Night Football in your Elizibethan froppery. All of a sudden, a stream of shovelheads rush through the door with murder in their eyes and Molotovs in their hands. They burn everything and everyone to the ground, crying out to some false Vampire God who shares its name with an obscure french cheese.
- The sabbat found out where the Elysium was
- The Cam PCs didn't foresee a flood of suicide firebombers.

The above situations are all plausible things that could happen between PCs by some interpretation of the books. We do not let these sorts of things happen here. We firmly believe that players should not have to live in fear and attempt to prepare for every possible scenario in which they could get screwed. For some players that element adds danger and excitement. We choose to be story-focused and find these situations to be antithetical to good story.

I bring this up because some players regularly submit requests for things that they feel they need to protect themselves and their allies from PC-driven disaster. If you feel that there's an extreme threat scenario that you have to deal with, come talk to us about the threat instead. No NORAD-level bunker, magical wards, or standing army can protect your character better than we can. No level of walls or magic can make you feel safer than knowing what the boundaries between PCs are.

I leave you with a incomplete list of examples of things that will justify a PC being killed:
- Switching to the opposing faction
- Becoming combative in the opposing faction's official headquarters
- Making an attempt on the life of another PC or their close PC allies
- Making an attempt to destroy another PC's business or home
- Failing to sexx0r Sponge's sekret PC

What will make staff kill a PC out of the blue? Nothing. If a player abides by policies and plays in-theme, we stay out of the way. In the event that policy or theme are being violated, it is not the character but the player that will be addressed.

& Restricting RP
[header(Restricting RP)]
  [pcol(No player or character may prevent another player or character from RPing.)]

The purpose of our game is RP and preventing RP defeats our purpose. No player may act to inhibit another player's RP through IC or OOC means. The relationship between the characters is not relevant, even in relationships with established dominance: Shifter/Kin, Vampire/Ghoul, Demon/Thrall, etc. Players are welcome to negotiate restrictions between each other but this is non-binding. Everyone is entitled to the freedom to find RP where and when it is available.

The spirit of the policy is that inhibiting another player's RP for personal reasons is unacceptable. Players must respect the freedoms and boundaries of other players. This should not be confused with sensible IC repercussions; consorting with the opposing faction or a widely-accepted enemy group (infernalists) may be a crime or carry significant negative social implications. If you're an Anarch, advising another Anarch to stay away from Mages or Shifters doesn't clearly make sense. One Anarch advising another to stay away from Camarilla or Sabbat members is quite sensible.

Combat at risk 2 or higher can result in imprisonment (per [pcol(+policy risk 2)]) and isn't related to the above. However, if a player finds their character imprisoned for this reason, they should consider setting themselves to lower risk in the presence of the imprisoning player after the imprisonment is over.

[pcol(This policy needs more clear wording)]

& bans
& banning
& discipline
& punishment
[header(Bans)]
It is occasionally appropriate to remove a player from the game and prevent them from connecting and participating. Harassment and cheating are clear examples. For a ban to be appropriate the following criteria must both apply:
 * The player (not the character) must be detrimental to the game
 * The player (not the character) is very unlikely to behave differently in the future

The decision to be made is always whether or not the player will be a detriment in the future and it is almost always a judgement call; rarely something that can be decided using a set of simple criteria. A "3 Strikes" system allows a bad-intentioned player to get away with it twice and cuts off a well-intentioned player who's trying to do the right thing but makes mistakes.

Some things that are ineffective at improving the situation:
 * Penalizing a character: taking away XP, stats, build projects, etc
 * Shaming/belittling the player:
 * Restricting the player/character's RP

When a player is being actively hostile to another player or staff they may be removed from the game for 72 hours. This is intended to stop the hostility in progress and demonstrate that staff are willing to act on it. Before such a temporary ban is enacted, the player must be advised by staff to stop but player persists anyway.

When a player is banned permanently, staff must make a +bbpost with a list of the affected characters and a brief, discrete synopsis of the reason for the ban. The list of characters is intended to let players know that those characters won't be returning and any RP hooks that depended on them should be resolved. Disclosing the reason is intended to provide a level of public oversight. This synopsis should not provide great detail for the purposes of privacy. Also for the sake of privacy, the post should not be made until four days have elapsed; staff will make mistakes and disclosing someone's alts unnecessarily is serious error.

A temporary ban is [pcol(never)] to be publicly disclosed. Losing one's cool is human and not something that warrants permanent stigma.

When a player is banned over a specific encounter, temporarily or permanently, the player is entitled to have a log of the specific incident delivered to them within 24 hours. When a ban is administered based on a pattern of behavior it may not be feasible to provide a single log or a representative body of logs in this fashion. In such cases it becomes a function of best-effort.
