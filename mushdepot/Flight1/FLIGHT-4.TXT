@IDESC Borg Cube=This room is quite larger that you had imagined. It is an amazing place. Glancing at the walls, you notice that they are made of a rich grain of wood; expensive and look down at the floor you see that it is made out of marble, also expensive. To one end of the room, where the entrance is are steps which lead down to the floor. To either side of you, you notice pedestals which seem to be arranged in an equal distance which encircles the walls. On these pedestals you notice display cases that house precious artifacts. In one case you see a statue which was brought from the Gamma Quadrant, in another, you notice a piece of gold from a century in Earth before the use of latinum was implemented and the others house artifacts, but other pedestals house items of power and destruction and that is why they are housed in containers protected by force fields. As you glance around the room looking at the wall, you notice several famous paintings which gives the room a sort of fancy look. Against one of the far walls you notice a desk with a comfy black leather chair resting behind it. In the center of the room there is a part of the floor which is raised and in the center sits a chair. The room is lit in various areas by a hidden light source, which is mainly for giving the display cases a sort of ascent. The raised part of the floor is lit by a red type of lighting which only seems to light the center part of the room where the chair and platform is. There is a latinum plated panel on the wall.
