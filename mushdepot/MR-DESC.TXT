
&RDESC Meeting Room -- TrekMUSH Alliance HQ=You are in the luxdirous room of the TrekMUSH Alliance HQ. The place where the Alliance works all night and day to make it's presentable, or atleast what they think is presentable. In the middle of the room is a long conference table where the members of the Alliance sit about thinking and planning. Towards the back are several computers on desks with coffee cigars and candy wraps strewn about. Piles of paper are stacking high, and all about. Comfortable chairs are all around the computers. Towards the front of the room is a replicator and to  the left of that, is a giant jukebox. And next to that is a giant pop machine from the '50s and a old candy machine next to it.
