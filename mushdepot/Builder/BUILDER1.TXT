Jesse_Krug's builder(#108629I)
Type: THING Flags: INHERIT
Just type (exit abbrev)>>(name of new room), where exit abbrev is n,s,w,e,nw,
ne,sw,se,u, or d, and the room will be created with forward and backward exits,
and succ, osucc, and odrop messages set on both exits.%rFeel free to modify
exit names and success messages, or even add your own, just model after the
ones that are already there.  All that needs to be set are an attribute for the
names of the two exits (i.e.: N:north;n south;s), and an attribute for the
success messages.%r%rNOTE: This object is (initially) set sticky and will go to
room #0 if you drop it.%r%rPlease talk to Shiala if you find any bugs or have
any comments.
