Barkeeper Parent(#360VYhs)
Type: THING Flags: VISUAL PARENT_OK HALTED SAFE
A rather beautiful individual - roughly six feet tall at a guess, she appears
to be in her late-thirtys. Well-build with a beautiful complexion and accent,
she is a barkeep and server here. Sometimes loud, impatient, and usually in
good spirits (sometimes literally) - she's ready to take orders.%R%R%T(OOC:
Type 'assistance' for commands.)
